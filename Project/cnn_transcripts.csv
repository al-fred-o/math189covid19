3,CNN,"""The police showed up and we all searched for a good while. I think he got spooked and ran after Travis confronted him. Travis says they (sic) guy ran into the house."" ""Let me know if he shows up or they find him. I appreciate you letting me know.""   In a recording of a 911 call made February 11, a caller who identified himself as Travis McMichael said he'd just ""caught a guy running into a house being built, two houses down from me. When I turned around, he took off running into the house."" The man reached into his pocket when he saw the caller, so he might be armed, the caller said. The man was a ""black male. Red shirt, white shorts."" The neighborhood had been having a lot of burglaries and break-ins, the caller said in the recording that was provided to CNN by the Brunswick 911 operations coordinator, Cara Richardson. In the more than seven weeks before the shooting, there was only one burglary reported in the Satilla Shores neighborhood: a 9 mm pistol stolen January 1 from Travis McMichael's unlocked truck outside the McMichael's home, the Glynn County Police Department has said. The 911 call ended when police arrived. Motion-sensor security cameras recorded surveillance video showing a trespassing on English's property on February 11, Graddy said. English told CNN he could not identify the person he says he saw on the video after the February 11 incident. He did not report the incident to the police, he said.  Surveillance video appeared to show Arbery at the same construction site just moments before he was killed on February 23. In that video, a man can be seen walking around and not touching anything. English said he did not report a crime after that episode, and he only saw the footage after Arbery's death, Graddy has said.  ""I don't want it to be put out and misused and misinterpreted for people to think that I had accused Mr. Arbery of stealing or robbery, because I never did,"" English told CNN's Chris Cuomo on Tuesday night. After the shooting, Greg McMichael told police there had been ""several break-ins"" in the area, and that Arbery looked like a suspect caught on surveillance video. When the McMichaels saw Arbery jogging on the day of the shooting, the two men grabbed guns and chased him, according to the police report.  When they caught up to him, Travis McMichael exited the truck with a shotgun, and a struggle ensued between him and Arbery, according to the report. The elder McMichael alleged to police that Travis McMichael shot Arbery after the latter attacked him."

9,CNN,"""Big News!"" Trump tweeted Tuesday morning, referring to a story about the unmasking list.  While US citizens names are required to be kept secret in intelligence reports, senior officials do have the ability to ask for names to be revealed in certain circumstance to better understand the reports. In the past, some Obama officials have acknowledged requesting to identify people but have insisted there were legitimate reasons. The decision to release the names was made by Grenell, a Trump loyalist, and came days after Attorney General William Barr's controversial decision to drop a criminal case against Flynn.  On Thursday, the Justice Department filed a request to a federal judge to drop the case against Flynn, whose lies about his contacts with Russia prompted Trump to fire him three years ago. Flynn later flipped on Trump, pleaded guilty to lying, and cooperated in the Russia investigation. But he reversed course last year, started attacking the Russia investigation, and tried to undo his guilty plea. The court must formally approve the DOJ's request to dismiss the case. Tuesday's news also comes as Trump is facing scrutiny on two fronts -- Senate testimony from top health officials and members of the coronavirus task force about the White House's response efforts and a Supreme Court hearing on the necessity of allowing lawmakers to access the President's tax returns.  While the ability to declassify documents of this nature is fully within the purview of the DNI, there are clear questions about the political motivations behind this specific move by Grenell, whose tenure as acting DNI appears to be coming to an end pending the confirmation of Trump's permanent pick for the job, Rep. John Ratcliffe.   Grenell has taken on an increasingly prominent role in helping the President reshape the narrative surrounding the 2016 investigations into Russian efforts to help Trump win the election and possible ties to the President's campaign.  Along with Barr, Grenell has moved to release documents that predecessors at Justice and the DNI had been slow to release.  Many of the documents illustrate the alarm among US national security officials in 2016 about Russians' election interference, and the effort by US officials to figure out why the Russians were seeking to aid Trump's election, and why Trump and people associated with his campaign seemed to be openly and discreetly encouraging such help. Some of the documents also show missteps in those investigative efforts.  With the 2020 election looming, Trump and allies in Congress and conservative media have highlighted parts of documents to claim there was an Obama-administration conspiracy to target Trump and his campaign. And while Grenell has insisted that the declassification is about increased transparency, the material notably does not include a transcript of Flynn's calls with former Russian Ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak, during the Trump transition in 2017.  Those calls have only been summarized but factored into a core piece of the Mueller investigation. Overall, the number of Americans unmasked has increased under over the last three years of the Trump administration. According to ODNI's Statistical Transparency reports,10,012 Americans were umasked in 2019 in response to a specific request. Nearly 17,000 Americans were unmasked in 2018 and 9,529 in 2017. Under the Obama administration, 9,217 Americans were unmasked in 2016 and only 1,122 in 2015.  In September 2017, multiple sources told CNN that former President Barack Obama's national security adviser Susan Rice told House investigators that she unmasked the identities of senior Trump officials out of concerns about the propriety of the United Arab Emirates Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan's visit to the United States in late 2016. During the visit, which took place during the transition period before Trump was sworn into office, the crown prince met with Flynn, the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and adviser Steve Bannon in New York, sources said at the time. The Obama administration felt misled by the UAE, which had failed to mention that Zayed was coming to the US even though it's customary for foreign dignitaries to notify the US government about their travels, according to several sources familiar with the matter at the time. Rice told the House Intelligence Committee she requested the names of the Americans mentioned in the classified report be revealed internally, a practice officials in both parties say is common. The meeting preceded a separate effort by the UAE to facilitate a back-channel communication between Russia and the incoming Trump White House. "
10,CNN,"As students head back to classrooms in other countries, schools are adapting in order to keep students safe.  In Taiwan, for example, there are now plastic partitions around the desks of elementary school students during lunch. The Australian government has asked more vulnerable staffers in their schools to work from home if possible. In Denmark, cafeterias are disappearing and students now eat in their classrooms to avoid large gatherings.  Now, it's the United States' turn to determine what must be done to open schools safely.  My colleague Evan McMorris-Santoro has been covering the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the United States educational system. I talked with him about how and when students — from pre-K to college — might go back to classrooms. Gupta: What have you sort of seen? Are people processing this the way that you would expect? Or are they not believing that this is necessary? What are you hearing?  Evan McMorris-Santoro, CNN correspondent: Well, you know, one of the wildest things about this whole time has been just how quickly the change had to happen. So, you know, you think back to March, we're having a normal school year.  But everything changed just so quickly. The best way I can think about describing it actually came from Lily Eskelsen García, who's the president of the NEA [National Education Association], which is the largest teachers' union in the United States.  Lily Eskelsen-García, NEA president: We're in the middle of trying to find the right metaphor. A lot of teachers have said we're building the airplane while it's going down the runway. Another teacher said, ""Oh, it's bigger than that. We're Apollo 13. We're Houston. And we have a problem. And our kids are on that spaceship with their parents, isolated.""  McMorris-Santoro: The efforts that go into a successful school year are already massive. Right? Like the moon shot. We've got to get a crew to the moon and get them back. But what happened in this case was something went wrong along the way, and it actually made the job harder.  Because all of a sudden, it's not Apollo 11 now, it's Apollo 13, in which everything breaks down. And then you have to use only the tools inside people's lives and their home lives to get education done. You know, we think about that scene in the movie where they dumped that stuff on the conference table, it's like OK, here's all the tubes and stuff they have on the ship.  Apollo 13 clip: OK, people listen up. We've got to find a way to make this fit into the hole for this using nothing but that. McMorris-Santoro: Well, this is what they're talking about when it comes to education. All you have is the technology inside people's houses, it's a very different kind of teaching. It's a very different kind of education. But the schools themselves, in terms of doing what we count on schools to do. They were not prepared for this.  Gupta: Do you get any sense, Evan, that they're starting to think about the fall? I mean, right now we hear about states reopening, obviously all over the country. And at the same time, we hear maybe there is going to be another wave or this isn't going to really go away. Is the general sort of idea that schools will be back open in the fall, or what are you hearing?  McMorris-Santoro: Well, the difficulty for schools is the same difficulty facing a lot of people, which is that they have to take a long time to plan where they're going to do next. But we don't know what's going to happen next.  So at a baseline level, I can say this. There will be schools open in the fall from the K through 12 level into the college level. What that looks like, we're not totally clear on.  Gupta: A few years ago for ""60 Minutes,"" I did this piece about the Khan Academy. And they were making the case, I remember this years ago, that there could be advantages to online learning. Are there advantages that this type of learning offers over bricks and mortar?  McMorris-Santoro: When we went to a full online system, what we learned was that we had problems with things like the education gap. The education gap that already existed became much, much more broad. I spoke to a teacher in LA named Janin Spoor, you know, she can't even take attendance, absence rates are high.  Janin Spoor: We're dealing with a few things. We're dealing with some students whose parents still have to go to work. And so being the oldest, because I teach high school. So a lot of them are having to take care of younger siblings.  We do everything we can. We send e-mails and make phone calls and things like that. So I think that we are definitely going to have a learning gap. We're gonna see it in the next few years. We're going to have lower test scores. I think it's inevitable. Gupta: As part of your reporting, have you been talking to the students themselves? I mean, I'm wondering what, how are they reacting to this, adapting to this?  McMorris-Santoro: The students are stressed out. We're hearing that from teachers. We're hearing that from parents. And I think in my own conversation with the students themselves, I felt that same thing. There is an excitement, I think, about something new at first.  And as we've gone along with this thing, you've found that the stress is just, they want to go back to traditional school. I have not yet met a student who is like, man, I would love to do school from my parents basement for the rest of my life. That's not something that I've heard.  Gupta: Yeah, I think that that reflects my kids' attitudes as well, although I will tell you it's funny, Evan, maybe not surprising, when this first started, I said we're still going to maintain a schedule.  You're going to get up, you're going to shower, you're gonna brush your teeth, you know, the basic stuff. And now if they can roll out of bed and get to their laptop in time, it's sometimes asking too much. McMorris-Santoro: Listen, if we're all going to work in our sweatpants, they can definitely go to school in sweatpants, right, Sanjay?  Gupta: One thing that we are seeing is that some schools are reopening, you know, in Montana, for example. And I'm wondering, you know, how are they approaching that? What are they doing there? And are there lessons, I guess, for the rest of the country?  McMorris-Santoro: Because Montana is a state very different from more populous states, they have these really small schools and these really small school districts. One of them is Willow Creek School, which has 60 kids in it. It's in a town of 250 people, about, and 60 kids. The superintendent and the principal of Willow Creek is named Bonnie Lower. And what she described was a school day very different than what we're used to.  Bonnie Lower, Willow Creek School superintendent/principal: We have 6-foot distant marks on the playground, so they can play games at recess and stay 6 feet away from each other. We will alternate our bell schedule, so kids are not in the hallways at the same time; common areas are being disinfected regularly, every classroom has hand sanitizer, wipes; teachers have masks, so if they're in a student's bubble, they put the masks on. They'll, they'll — a lot of precautions. Bathrooms will be used one at a time. We're ready to get back to normal. As normal as we can. McMorris-Santoro: And even the arrival to school is very different. So they've had to reduce bus schedule. So a lot of parents are dropping their kids off. And then once the kids get to school, they are led into the building by an adult, one by one. And before they go in, their temperature is taken. There's no more lunch in cafeterias. So they are in the building.  But the school day looks very, very different. And these are the kind of things that we may see in schools across the country when they reopen. This is the challenge. The challenge is how to try to do social distancing in something that was never designed for that. Gupta: We've all been forced to evaluate risk differently. I mean, the truth is that we all take risks on a daily basis. You know, getting in a car and driving is one of the riskiest things that we typically do.  And there's a lot of people who say, well, a kickball and then somebody touched that. I touched it with my hands and then I touch my eyes, my nose, my mouth, something like that. What are the chances of me really getting infected?  And it's still very hard, I think, for public health officials to answer that question. But I think what they'll typically come back to is that the answer is that the risk is low, but it's not zero.  McMorris-Santoro: I spoke with a rising college freshman from Minnesota. We're trying to plan on what schools he was going to go to. And, you know, the college campuses are out there right now, advertising, look, we're going to reopen. We don't know how we're going to try to make it safe. We're gonna change maybe the way dorms, work classes, whatever. What they really have to do is try to convince people that they can create a safe environment.  I asked this kid, this is an 18-year-old kid. And I said, look, if they open a college campus right now, would you go? And he said, no. Right now, I would not. Maybe in August, maybe I could be convinced that things were safe. But right now I'm not ready to go. So there's a difference in how people take that risk and feel about the risk factors and feel about how things are going on that maybe you have a situation where these elementary school students in Montana.  Their parents are feeling like, look, this is a worthy risk. We'll take, you know, we'll see how it goes. If it doesn't work, we'll just shut things down again. And it's not that big a deal. And on the other hand, you have, you know, this student who is trying to choose a college and who is not yet convinced that the college can create a safe enough environment for him.  Gupta: If school doesn't return to some sense of normalcy at the beginning of next school year, how big of an impact is that financially on these colleges? I mean, are they worried about being able to actually continue providing the level of education that they do?  McMorris-Santoro: I think they're worried about their finances. And there's definitely concern — that's widespread — that students might not enroll in the same numbers come fall. I spoke to Wayne Frederick about this, he's the president of Howard University. Wayne Frederick, Howard University president: Intent to come, I want to be clear, may not translate in students showing up. So the intent is good. It's stronger than we would expect. But we are being realistic about the fact that continuing students may struggle to come back because their family's economic circumstance may have changed very differently over the next three to four months. And the fact that incoming students may find themselves in a circumstance in which they can't afford it. McMorris-Santoro: So he's concerned about students committing to attend, which seems to be a valid fear. One student I spoke with is named Sam Zellmer. He is a freshman at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He talked to me from his bedroom at his parents' house in Minnesota, where he's currently taking all of his classes. And he told me if this is how college is going to be in the fall, he just might not go back. Sam Zellmer: So I haven't made any actual decisions yet, but I am considering either taking a gap semester or maybe transitioning to something like an online community college that's closer to me in order to minimize the cost of going, especially if I'm getting relatively the same amount out of it. Gupta: One of the things that really sparks some fear in my own kids' hearts was when they heard [California] Governor Gavin Newsom talk about the fact that maybe one solution would be to reopen early, start in July, I think is what he even suggested. Anything, I mean, what do you, what did you think of that? Is that a potentially good solution or at least avenue?  McMorris-Santoro: What the California idea about is really just, I think, illustrates the challenges that come ahead with all of this, because what happens in a place like California is you have a massive, massive education system. So many students in school. And they're trying to figure out ways to sort of get these kids back up to speed as quickly as they possibly can. And one of these ways we look, let's get him in school and do months and months of school during the summer and just try to get everything back going. But again, that requires facilities being ready, which is an expense and a time-consuming thing. It requires buy-in from the teachers. And we've already seen teachers' unions be a little reticent to some of these ideas. And it requires students who are ready to do this and ready to learn and be a part of this. And it's not clear where their heads are going to be at when this thing is over. They're still living through a very, very stressful time. I mean, and if you and I are stressed out going to work from our house, imagine what it's like for a 15-year-old kid. I mean, this is, this is, this is a heavy thing.  Gupta: As we figure out whether to bring students back to classrooms or to continue school virtually, one thing is clear: Schools have already become a critical support system for students and their families during this pandemic.  They have continued to provide a level of education, but also some sense of schedule, some sense of normalcy, some sense of socialization, all of which is so important. If we continue to work together, if we listen to the data and have some patience, we can get students back to school — as safely as possible.   We'll be back tomorrow. Thanks for listening."
11,CNN,"""She's not stepping up. All she does is sit there and blame the federal government. She doesn't get it done. And we send her a lot."" -- Donald Trump on Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer ""Governor Cuomo should spend more time 'doing' and less time 'complaining'. Get out there and get the job done."" -- Donald Trump on New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ""@JBPritzker, Governor of Illinois, and a very small group of certain other Governors, together with Fake News @CNN & Concast (MSDNC), shouldn't be blaming the Federal Government for their own shortcomings."" -- Donald Trump on Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker ""If they don't treat you right, I don't call."" -- Donald Trump on governors 3. ""It should have never been allowed to happen; it should have been stopped at the source."" This is a common line for Trump now as he seeks to lay blame for coronavirus on the Chinese and their demonstrated lack of transparency in terms of the virus and its initial spread. At the same time, it seems a lot to ask of any country to ""stop"" a virus with the level of transmissibility that Covid-19 has. After all, the US knew the virus was headed our way for months and we now have more than 1 million cases and more than 80,000 dead. 4. ""In every generation, through every challenge and hardship and danger, America has risen to the task. We have met the moment and we have prevailed."" Worth noting that the latest IHME model projects more than 134,000 American deaths by early August. Which would mean that roughly 53,000 people will die between today and August 4. Those people don't likely believe that ""we have prevailed."" 5. ""In the fourth quarter we're going to do very good and next year I think we're going to have one of the best years we've ever had because there's a tremendous pent-up demand."" Worth noting this is a timeline change for Trump. He had long insisted that the economy would immediately bounce back once the country began reopening. He is now suggesting that it won't be until 2021 when things will truly recover. 6. ""I've felt things a lot over my life and I've made a lot of good calls."" [opens mouth to say something, decides against it] 7. ""But we're transitioning to greatness and the greatness is going to be in the fourth quarter but it's really going to be next year and it's going to be a year like we've never had before."" A lot of people focus on the fourth quarter. But it's the fifth quarter that really matters! That's where greatness is most effectively transitioned.  8. ""We had the best economy in the history of the world, not just here but anywhere in the world."" [Narrator voice] This isn't true. 9. ""We had the best economy anywhere in the world and we were going for numbers, whether it was unemployment numbers where we had our best numbers. Employment also numbers. Little different."" Uh........ 10. ""Now we had one of the best weeks in the history of our border between the United States and Mexico, our southern border. We had very few people coming in, very, very few."" [raises hand tentatively] Might that slowdown in border crossings be due to the pandemic raging in our country? 11. ""But again, we've had the best numbers."" Beautiful numbers. The greatest. Many people are saying it. 12. ""It's the hidden enemy. Remember that. It's the hidden enemy. So, things happen."" ""Things happen."" So true. 13. ""The one who tested positive will be fine, will be absolutely fine."" Dr. Trump offers his diagnosis of Katie Miller, the vice president's press secretary, who tested positive for coronavirus last Friday. 14. ""This building is shocking, if you look at the numbers."" Donald Trump on the White House.  15. ""Very soon. I mean, really, very soon."" This is Trump's response to a question on when the average person will be able to be tested for coronavirus ""every day as they go back to work."" There is very little evidence that we will have testing for all 160 million working Americans anytime soon. Or even ""very soon."" 16. ""You look at all of these machines here. They're incredible machines, the best anywhere in the world."" Speaking of incredible machines ... 17. ""Other countries are calling, sophisticated countries, and they're calling, lots of countries."" ""Sophisticated countries,"" you say? Tell me more... 18.""They have learned about -- I see everybody, just about everybody has a face mask on."" The President wasn't wearing a mask when he said this. And he doesn't plan to wear one. So, yeah. 19. ""They have learned about face masks, the good and the bad, by the way. It's not a one-sided thing, believe it or not."" Masks can be bad? I suppose Trump is suggesting that people touch their faces more when they wear masks? I truly don't know. 20. ""No, we prevailed on testing is what I'm referring to. That was with regard to testing."" So, Trump is editing his previous comment -- see No. 4 -- that his comments about having ""prevailed"" was solely about testing not about the broader fight against the virus. Even so, it's very hard to see how we have prevailed on testing -- at least yet. 21. ""And greatness is next year, right from the beginning."" Mark your calendar: January 1, 2021 is when greatness begins. 22. ""In the case of me, I'm not -- I'm not close to anybody."" This is Trump's defense for why he isn't wearing a mask. But it's not the real reason he isn't wearing a mask. 23.""I understand you very well, better than you understand yourself."" Did you not know that Trump was a psychiatrist? He already knew you didn't know that, by the way. 24. ""Now that we're doing so well on tests and so quick and so fast, five minutes, et cetera, and so accurate, you're complaining that we're getting too many tests. So you can't win."" No one in the media is complaining about the number of tests available. The question is -- and has been -- when the average person will have the access to immediate and daily testing like the White House staff does. 25. ""As far as Americans getting a test, they should all be able to get a test right now. They should be able to get a test."" Whether they ""should"" or not, they aren't. 26. ""They want our country open. I want our country open too. I want it open safely. But I want it open. Don't forget."" To be clear, almost every single epidemiologist and infectious disease expert has made clear that the more a state reopens its economy, the more likely it is that coronavirus begins spreading rapidly in that state. I suppose this depends on what your meaning of ""safe"" is? 27. ""You can go with the enclosed route. Everything's closed up; you're in your house, you're not allowed to move. People are dying with that, too."" No state passed any sort of guideline that required people to not be ""allowed to move."" 28. ""The 20,000 [cases] -- the numbers are way down from what they were two weeks ago. I mean, the numbers are really coming down; they're very substantially -- and this weekend was one of the lowest we've had. This is, you know, the numbers are coming down very rapidly -- all throughout the country, by the way."" According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were more than 23,000 coronavirus cases diagnosed in the US on Sunday, May 10. A week prior -- May 3 -- there were more than 29,000 cases diagnosed. But just two days later, there were just over 22,000 diagnoses of Covid-19. In short, the numbers continue to bounce around a bit. But what's clear is that the numbers aren't coming down ""very rapidly."" 29. ""But as far as the models are concerned, if you go by the model, we were going to lose 2.2 million people."" This was never going to be true. Not ever.  30. ""We're at the lowest of all of the models. I mean, if you look at, I guess that 120,000 -- 100,000 to 120,000 people would be at the low side. And we're at -- there's nothing low."" ""Now we're going toward 50,000 -- I'm hearing, or 60,000 people. One is too many. I always say it. One is too many, but we're going toward 50,000 or 60,000 people. That's at the lower -- as you know the lower (end of the projections) was supposed to be 100,000 people."" -- Donald Trump, April 21 31. ""You know what the crime is. The crime is very obvious to everybody. All you have to do is read the newspapers, except yours."" The question Trump was asked is this: What is the crime that Trump is accusing former President Barack Obama of committing? And Trump's answer, of course, is not an answer at all. Because there is no crime. Or at least not one he -- or anyone else -- has elucidated. 32. ""Well they're losing their lives everywhere in the world and maybe that's a question you should ask China. Don't ask me, ask China that question, OK? When you ask them that question, you may get a very unusual answer."" In which the President of the United States tells CBS News' Weijia Jiang, who was born in China but immigrated to the US at age 2, that she should ask China her question about why he is casting testing capacity as a global competition. Jiang replied by asking why Trump was ""saying that to me specifically, that I should ask China?"" To which Trump responded: ""I'm telling you -- I'm not saying it's specifically to anybody, I'm saying it to anybody that would ask a nasty question like that."" Of course, he didn't say it to just anybody. He said it to a Chinese-American reporter. And if you think that was by accident, you haven't been paying attention for the past three years. 33. ""I did and you didn't respond and now I'm calling on the young lady in the back. Please?"" Trump called on CNN's Kaitlan Collins. Then he decided he didn't want her to ask a question. That's all that happened here. 34. ""OK. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much, appreciate it. Thank you very much."" And then Trump decided to just end the press conference -- mere seconds after he had called on Kaitlan and then the ""young lady in the back."" So, yeah, this feels like a good place to end."
12,CNN,"McCord and then-acting Attorney General Sally Yates never apparently disagreed with law enforcement's need to interview Flynn after the discovery of his discussions with the then-Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak before Trump took office. They feared the Russians would know he had misled the Trump administration and that Flynn could be compromised. But the Justice Department led by Barr now says that ""whatever gaps in his memory Mr. Flynn might or might not reveal upon an interview regurgitating the content of those calls would not have implicated legitimate counterintelligence interests or somehow exposed Mr. Flynn as beholden to Russia,"" according to Thursday's court filing. McCord declined to comment further on Monday, saying she believed her op-ed spoke for itself. Yates did not respond to requests for comment. The Justice Department's decision to drop the case against Flynn case has prompted intense criticism from former prosecutors alleging Barr is skewing the law to help a Trump associate -- as they also say he did before the sentencing of political adviser Roger Stone. Until last week, the Justice Department had defended the FBI's and prosecutors' work on the Flynn case. Here are more ways where the DOJ's latest approach has split from the public record in the Flynn case: Details of Flynn's call with Kislyak McCord says the Justice Department cherry-picked her statements about the seriousness of Flynn's calls with Kislyak and the national security risk at the time. That appears to be the case in the Justice Department's 20-page motion to dismiss, which leaves out quotations of the Flynn-Kislyak call -- details that the Justice Department has kept hidden from the public even following a judge's order. Nothing said on the calls ""indicate an inappropriate relationship between Mr. Flynn and a foreign power,"" the Justice Department wrote last week. In those December 2016 calls, Flynn undermined sanctions that President Barack Obama imposed as punishment for election meddling, and undercut the US position on a United Nations resolution about Israel, according to admissions Flynn made in his guilty plea. The Justice Department filing glossed over potentially substantive parts of Flynn's calls: ""In the words of one senior DOJ official: 'It seemed logical ... that there may be some communications between an incoming administration and their foreign partners.' Such calls are not uncommon when incumbent public officials preparing for their oncoming duties seek to begin and build relationships with soon-to-be counterparts."" That statement came from McCord's interview with Mueller prosecutors, which was captured in a 12-page memo called a 302. The memo makes it clear that McCord thought Flynn's having the call ""seemed logical"" at first for an incoming administration.  ""However, that changed when Vice President Michael Pence went on Face the Nation and said things McCord knew to be untrue,"" the FBI memo says. ""Also, as time went on, and then-White House spokesperson Sean Spicer made comments about Flynn's actions she knew to be false, the urgency grew."" That second part -- with the growing urgency -- was omitted from Thursday's Justice Department filing. There also is no complete public record of what Flynn said to Kislyak on those calls -- and how clearly he made the asks of the Russians on behalf of the incoming Trump administration.   Exact quotes from Flynn's call with Kislyak have not been admitted in public records or even disclosed to Congress. They are kept still redacted by DOJ when much of the rest of the record is being declassified and made public. Earlier in Flynn's case, before his sentencing hearing, federal Judge Emmet Sullivan demanded the release of any audio transcripts of the Flynn-Kislyak calls. But the prosecutors told the judge more information about what was said on the calls wasn't relevant to Flynn's sentencing. The case moved on without the disclosure.  The reasons to investigate Flynn The Justice Department's rationale for dropping the Flynn case largely revolves around arguing there wasn't a legitimate reason for the FBI to interview him. In court papers, the Justice Department focuses on the Logan Act, an archaic and little-used law banning unauthorized Americans from negotiating with foreign diplomats, and standards the FBI needed to investigate Flynn. The filing last week argued that because the FBI was preparing to close a counterintelligence investigation into Flynn's ties with Russia in early January 2017, before learning about his policy discussions with Kislyak, the investigation had no reason to continue. But Flynn's discussions with the Russian ambassador raised new questions about what was said on the calls and why. When the special counsel's office charged Flynn with lying in late 2017, it said he had communicated about his conversations with Kislyak to top Trump transition officials. More details about those back-and-forths are still unknown. The Justice Department now argues that because the law was unlikely to be enforced in a criminal prosecution, there was essentially no legal basis to investigate Flynn. ""In short, Mr. Flynn's calls with the Russian ambassador—the only new information to arise since the FBI's decision to close out his investigation—did not constitute an articulable factual basis to open any counterintelligence investigation or criminal investigation,"" the Justice Department wrote last week. But McCord and several former officials who handled the case say there were strong national security reasons to get to the bottom of Flynn's conduct. Primarily, Flynn's lies to senior Trump officials, including Pence, made him vulnerable to Russian blackmail. Indeed, the labeling of the Flynn investigation is a bit fuzzy -- it began as a counterintelligence probe but expanded over time after Flynn's potentially criminal conduct was uncovered. This includes the phone call, his lies during the FBI interview and eventually undisclosed foreign lobbying for Turkey that he admitted to in his plea but was ignored by the DOJ last week. The Justice Department cited McCord's testimony to Mueller and said the rationale for the investigation was ""vacillating"" between counterintelligence and criminal. But McCord pushed back in her op-ed, saying, ""that 'vacillation' has no bearing on whether the FBI was justified in engaging in a voluntary interview."" Yates, too, never said she objected to an investigation of Flynn. His lies to other members of the administration, according to Yates, were serious and deserved the White House's attention, at very least, and raised questions that investigators should have pursued.  ""There was a real problem with his underlying conduct,"" Yates explained to the House Intelligence Committee, according to a November 2017 interview transcript released last week. "
13,CNN,Thank you for using CNN 10
14,CNN,"Every day this week, I'm going to be talking to experts from all different fields about what we can expect in the months and years to come. The future of travel, education, surveillance and more.  To kick it all off, I couldn't think of anyone else better to talk to than my friend and colleague, Fareed Zakaria. His show, ""GPS,"" is a forum for discussion on global affairs, featuring conversations with political and business leaders from around the world. I've always valued his perspective as a political scientist and generally very smart guy. So I turned to him for insight on our post-pandemic future. To start off, I asked Fareed what his biggest fear was for the future. Fareed Zakaria, host of CNN's ""GPS"": I think there's no question that the biggest danger that comes out of this pandemic is that we enter a cold war with China.  If this takes us down a path of greater and greater confrontation with China, the world's second largest economy, the most populous country in the world, that's a whole new ball game, and that takes us into a very different world than the world of global stability and globalization and economic interdependence that we've lived in for the last 30 years. That's the part I'm watching most closely.  And right now, Sanjay, the signs are not great. I mean these kind of conflicts start in strange ways. And the issue of where this virus originated has taken on such a charged political feeling, and that's all mirrored in China. The Chinese also have their conservatives. They also have their nationalist sentiment. They also have their populist sentiment.  So it's a combustible mixture. Gupta: You know, it strikes me, you know, from a public health perspective, there is no doubt that there was little information in the beginning about this virus and some of the information that we know has changed. Does that sort of translate ultimately into distrust? What is the right sort of path of leadership when you're dealing with little information or evolving information?  Zakaria: If you go back to those early days, it's absolutely clear that the Chinese local health officials didn't realize what they were dealing with, mishandled it.  But the path of leadership to me would be to recognize, ""Look, what's done is done.""  It's not going to save one human life to attack the Chinese, but it is going to save a lot of lives if we can put this behind us and find a way to cooperate, cooperate on a vaccine, cooperate on how do you reopen world trade, how do you reopen world travel, how do you get cures out?  I mean, I think one of the great examples during the Cold War is even though the United States and the Soviet Union had thousands of nuclear missiles pointed at each other, they collaborated on a campaign to rid the world of smallpox, and they actually worked together to vaccinate as many countries as was possible.  Imagine if we could come out of this, because this is a pandemic that affects everybody, and say the United States and the Europeans and the Chinese got together and said, ""We are going to vaccinate the world."" That would be leadership because that's going to change the world. Gupta: Yeah. I've been reading a lot of your writing, all of it, I think, and watching your programs, as I always do. And I'm really interested in how you've been talking about politics. You have the fringe right, you have the fringe left, who in some ways have both felt emboldened by this in some way. Where do you think this global crisis is going to take us in the course of politics around the world? Zakaria: By nature, this should draw us together. It somehow should make us recognize our common humanity because it affects the rich and the poor. It affects you no matter what your skin color. It affects you no matter what your borders. But it hasn't. It's drawn us to be more insular, more narrow.  But I think, again, this is temporary, because I think fundamentally what this points to is the reality of the interdependence of our modern world. And you quickly come to realize that the only win-win solution here is cooperation. The only way you're actually going to manage to make this all better, because we are going to start at some point focusing on how do you get the economy back? How do you get growth back? Well, the way you get growth back is by buying and selling from other people. If we want to raise the living standards of our citizens and get so many of these people who are unemployed now back into work, we've got to get the world economy started, not just the U.S. economy. And so I'm hoping that we move in that direction. I'm also hoping that one of the things that this crisis shows us is the limits to that kind of populist [thinking], ""We don't need experts.""  And I'm hoping that this kind of crisis makes people realize, you know, there's a value for somebody who's actually spent his life studying medicine, who's still a practicing surgeon like you. I mean, it's that kind of thing that has value in every part of our lives, except for some reason in public discourse, where the loudest voice, not the most learned voice, wins. Gupta: Let me ask you, Fareed, about the economy. This is not an area of my expertise, but obviously the news is not good. Are we facing, do you think, a global depression?  Zakaria: I don't think anyone knows for sure, Sanjay, because it is truly a unique event. We've never seen anything like it. We literally put the economy into a coma. I think of it as the Great Paralysis rather than the Great Depression because you just paralyze the economy.  I think the key issue that I don't think people are focusing enough on and markets certainly don't seem to focus enough on: When you restart it first, it's not going to go back to 100 percent. The United States will be spared the worst, even though I think it will be very tough, because we uniquely have the ability to essentially print money.  The United States will borrow $3 trillion this quarter. That is more than it borrowed, I think, in the entire global financial crisis of 2008, 2009. But we can do it because the United States has, you know, the infinite capacity, because it is the world's reserve currency. It is the — seen as the most stable economy in the world. Very few countries have that option.   Gupta: And I don't want to be alarmist at all. But if you do look back at the previous model, I guess, of the influenza pandemic of 1918. If we're looking at that sort of timeline, which people have suggested is possible, given the vaccine production that is necessary and all that, what then of the economy? Can we continue to print money? Even with our status? Zakaria: Then I think it really separates the very small number of countries that have that capacity — United States, Japan, Germany, China — from a lot of the others. I think the big ones will still be able to because, you know, you have to put your money somewhere. There is not a lot of good options. And as long as the United States is the cleanest shirt in the hamper, even if it's a hamper full of very dirty clothes, you still have that advantage.  But Sanjay, I think it's going to be very tough in terms of the economy and the livelihoods of people, because we live in a very different world. Our economies are now so interconnected. There's so much cross-border everything, investment, trade, you know. And so it's not that easy to start up again.  Gupta: Yeah, you're absolutely right. Do you think that we're gonna see any long-term shifts away from cities during this time or even in the aftermath? Zakaria: You know, who knows? There's a part of me that feels that human beings have wanted to congregate together forever. And I think that we've survived plagues after plagues. We've survived the Black Death. And it didn't make people want to stop gathering, to celebrate, to mourn, to remember. We might do it somewhat differently and we might have to learn to do it somewhat differently in the short run, until — certainly until a vaccine.  I still think cities will still retain that sense of being centers and communities of civilization because of the art, the culture, the restaurants. And I think that, you know, a vaccine gets us past a lot of that. The larger question, it seems to me, is are we living in a way that makes these kind of epidemics, pandemics, really more and more likely? You know, with the way in which we're destroying the natural habitat of so many animals, like bats; with the kind of factory farming where you crowd cattle together and, you know, inches from each other, and it's almost a petri dish where viruses are going to jump and get stronger as they jump; global warming, which makes everything hotter and intensifies all these trends. You know, is this a moment for us to pause and say, ""Yeah, we want to get back to normal, but maybe it's time to rethink what normal means.""  The old normal was quite risky. And that there are ways to just approach nature in a way that is more mindful of the fact that if you wreak havoc on nature, nature can wreak havoc on you. Gupta: Fareed's outlook, like mine, is cautiously optimistic. I choose to believe that amid all this bad news is hope for a future that looks different but feels the same and is somehow still better. You can catch Fareed Zakaria's latest special, ""The Post-Covid-19 World,"" that's Sunday, May 24, at 10 a.m. [and 11 p.m.] EST, on CNN. He talks to former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and many more great guests.  We'll be back tomorrow. Thanks for listening."

16,CNN,"A transcript of the Daily DC Podcast interview with Sen. Duckworth is below.  DB: That was Sen. Tammy Duckworth talking about her history-making moment back in 2018 when she became the first person to bring her infant onto the floor of the US Senate.  Not only that, she was the first US senator to give birth while serving in office. Hey, everybody, I'm Dana Bash, CNN's chief political correspondent, in for David Chalian. And this is the Daily DC.  So this Sunday is Mother's Day. And for many moms across the country, quarantine and social distancing may mean spending the day apart from their loved ones. For other moms, it means wearing even more hats than us moms usually do. So in honor of Mother's Day and to highlight a truly badass woman, I'm excited to have Sen. Tammy Duckworth joining me to discuss governing, being a mom, being a homeschooler, all of those things. Sen. Duckworth, thank you so much for joining me. I appreciate it. TD: Oh, Dana. Thanks for having me on. And go, moms! DB: Exactly. By the way, obviously nobody can see, but I'm wearing a shirt right now for this occasion that says #momlife in honor of Sen. Duckworth. So on that, let's start with the new reality that so many parents, moms and dads are facing. You're working. You are with your children. You are homeschooling or at least helping with distance learning. Now, that is true across the country for parents. You are in a unique situation because you're a United States senator, so you're also working for the people of Illinois. How's it going?  TD: It's rough. Well, what I mean to say, no matter how rough it is for me, it's not as rough as a single mom who might be in a minimum wage job. You know, it might be a cashier at a grocery store who has to show up for work, and now what does she do because there's no childcare for her, and because the schools are out. But, yeah, it's rough. I mean, this morning I came in, I had an Armed Services hearing, committee hearing. Came in, sat through that, then rushed back home so that I could be home for a 12:30 to 1:30 Zoom conference call with her school because she has a school class meeting every day. Got that done and then immediately turn around and got back in the car and came back to the Capitol and made it back just in time to vote. And, now I'm here with you, and once we're done, I'm going to get back in the car and head back home, because it'll be time to take over, because, you know, my childcare gets done at 6 o'clock. And so I've got to be there to take over. DB: Ok, so let's let's talk about that a little bit. First of all, I should say, you have a 5-year-old named Abigail. TD: Yes.  DB: You have a 2-year-old named Maile. And so you're in it, I mean, you are in it. But you said that you do have childcare. How is that? TD: I have childcare. And I'm very fortunate that my mother also lives with us, but my mom is 79 years old. So it's tough, you're right, because childcare is a precise schedule. And when they're done, you have to be there to accept the hand over back with your children. But, you know, for me, I'm there all the time to do the homeschooling, to make the dinner and do all of those things that needs to happen. And so it was always a juggle before being a full-time working mom working outside the home. But this has made it even that much harder. DB: And so, are you staying home as much as you can? Obviously, this week is unique in that you, as a senator, are being asked to come into the office, which of course, is the United States Capitol. But before that, were you as home as much as you could be just for safety and social distancing purposes? TD: Yes. So like most folks, we were social distancing. We were home. I was home full-time. But, of course, I was on conference calls as a senator. I, you know, can do anywhere from two to a dozen calls and conference calls in a day. In many ways, I feel like my schedule was busier now that we're on, you know, staying at home, on quarantine. I'll be on a call, and suddenly a 2-year-old is running past me, you know, because she doesn't want to have her diaper put on and it's like, naked baby butt running past on a Zoom conference call. It's like, 'oh, oops, sorry, folks.' But you know, I'm at my dining room table, and this is just the way it has to be. DB: Yeah. And everybody is so much more forgiving than we would be as a society, no matter if you're a senator or not. Right? Just because I feel like everybody is in it. People get it. But you have a different situation. I mean, you have said, you said to one of my colleagues, I think earlier last month that you've got the Armed Services Committee in one ear, you're trying to Zoom in another with 24 5-year-olds for your daughter's, for Abigail's class. What's it like? TD: It's crazy. I mean, literally, she has four Zoom conference calls a week, Monday through Friday. DB: Is this Kindergarten?  TD: This is pre-K. Can you believe that? This is pre-K. DB: How many Zoom calls?  TD: Four.  DB: For pre-K?  TD: Four. For pre-K. Because they're doing distance learning, and so, I mean, that's wonderful because you don't want them to regress. But even with the regular meetings, I feel like she's regressing a little, you know. DB: I do.  TD: I do. And it terrifies me. And so like today, when I had to be in for the Armed Services hearing my staff's like, can you just stay in and finish off that day? And then, you know, I said, no, I can't miss the Zoom conference call. I, you know, she's going to miss 2+5=7. And then it's on me because I was a bad mom that I wasn't there to help her keep up. Right? DB: Ah, it's like a dagger in the heart. Right? TD: It is so. Society might be more forgiving, and people on the Zoom conference calls might be more forgiving, but in some ways, I think we moms are even harder on ourselves. DB: Yeah. I mean, so I have a son who will be nine next month. And, I think about the fact that I'm so lucky because he can manage the iPad and the app that he has to use for his classes pretty much on his own. I will get a text from the iPad about six to seven times a day from his quote-unquote classroom, which is his playroom. Mom, I need your help. Mom, I need you. Mom, I need you. So, you know, you run up and down the stairs, but it's not the same as a little kid like you have. Not to mention the 2-year-old. So, you're doing everything you need to do and potty training at the same time. Right? TD: Well, exactly. And they see me home. So it's wonderful. They're like, ""Mommy is here. And we get Mom all the time. But why isn't mom paying attention to us?"" Well, Mom's, you know, on a Democratic caucus call listening to Chuck Schumer. DB: Who cries more? Your kids or Chuck Schumer? I'm kidding. TD: Ah, me, me, me. DB: Oh, my goodness. So I want to talk about how this relates to your job as a policymaker. Right? And as a legislator. Because you tweeted this weekend an article from The Nation about how difficult it is going to be for parents, moms, and dads, to get back to work in a real way when and if there is no school or real childcare. And you tweeted, ""If it's not reasonable to open up the schools and it's not reasonable to greenlight summer camp, then it's not reasonable to reopen the hair salon and for some working mother to spend more money on childcare than she'll make from her day at work."" How are you as a member of Congress, as a senator, thinking about dealing with this reality as part of the Covid response? TD: All right. Well, you know, it's impossible choices that workers are being put in. So this is about childcare. It's also about, you know, though, all those workers in the meatpacking plants that are told, you better go back to work, and you and you don't have a choice if you don't show up like that. If that working mom doesn't show up for work, then you've quit, and if you've quit, now you don't qualify for unemployment insurance. And she can't afford to go back to work because she can't afford the childcare to take care of her children.  And so we put these parents into just these impossible choices. Some of the things that I'm working on for first responders and for essential workers, and by essential workers, I mean, of course, our heroic doctors and nurses and firefighters and all that. But, also, our heroic grocery store checkout cashiers and our janitors who work in those hospitals and all of those, and the people who drive our public buses to people in minimum wage jobs. The person who keeps me supplied with my McDonald's chicken nuggets for my daughter, you know. They have to show up to work. And so, I'm working to provide for additional funds, on top of their salary. And then in a worst case scenario, for those who do catch Covid-19 and pass away as a result of their job because they caught it on the job, a compensation fund for their survivors.  Bottom line, we need some things in this country that we've been fighting for a long time. We need universal paid family leave. We need childcare. We need universal pre-K. All of those things need to happen. DB: So money is one of them, but you just alluded to this in the end of that answer. There's structural, really big structural things that are missing for parents, for moms, for dads to be able to cope. You know, even if they get money for childcare. You know, not everybody can afford a nanny, so daycare centers may not even be open. It might not be an actual option. TD: That's exactly right, Dana. It might not actually be an option where you can actually take your child and take them to a daycare center. You may not be able to get a nanny to come to your home. I know folks who are thinking about doing group childcare. But that's dangerous, right? I mean, why why would we expose children to this -- this global pandemic that is literally killing, I mean, here in the US, over 60,000 individuals already. Why would we do that to ourselves?  And by the way, the people most affected by this are the people who are working those minimum wage jobs, who end up being the people who take care of our parents in the nursing homes, who make sure that our hospital rooms are clean, who make sure that they are handling our food when we get takeout. It's in our best interest, no matter what socio-economic spectrum you're in to watch out for all of us because we're in this together. And if we just watch out only for the people who can afford childcare and forget about the working families, then eventually it's going to come back to affect all of us because then we will catch this epidemic because people cannot afford to not go to work and they won't go to work when they're sick. DB: Before I let you go, you mentioned that your mom is living with you as well, which is a nice thing to have in any case, but particularly as you're going to be celebrating Mother's Day, as I mentioned at the top, there are a lot of people who aren't able to be with their moms or moms able to be with their kids because they're social distancing. How do you plan to kind of take advantage of the fact that you have the luxury of being with your mom and being with your kids as a mom this Sunday?  TD: Yeah, so I'm like a lot of Gen-X women. We're the sandwich generation, I'm taking care of my elderly parent, and I'm taking care of young kids at the same time. And, you know, we talk about childcare, but then also you have to worry about your elderly parents, as well, and the stresses from that. I'm going to take my girls and we're probably going to bake some cupcakes or something, and I'll call it that chemistry class from homeschooling. Yeah, or maybe I'll call it math class because she's measuring flour or sugar or something. DB: Listen, it's real, it works. TD: Yeah, exactly. But, I am fortunate that my mom is with us because she can step up. And she's great with doing that. And, I have that luxury of my mom being there. But then I also have, you know, I'm also handling my mom's doctor's appointments. I'm also handling helping her with her finances, you know, and making sure that she's well. And, you know, as I go back in and out of the Senate, I worry that I'm taking back this pandemic. DB: So that was the other thing I was going to ask. How are you keeping as safe as you possibly can going into a building where people have flown in from all over the country on planes and staffers and staffers, senators, everybody who works in the Capitol and in the office buildings? TD: So, you know, one of the last things that I did in the Army before I retired in 2014 was I actually gave briefings on global pandemics at the Pentagon. DB: Are you kidding me? TD: No, I'm not kidding you. Because at the time, we were dealing with SARS and H1N1. And so that was one of my last Army last projects.  DB: I feel like we buried the lede here.  TD: So here is what I've done. And I actually have very shallow trays from the wintertime that you use to catch the snow falling off your boots outside my house. I've got those filled with a little bit of water and some Clorox in them, a half a cup of Clorox, which is what we do with Ebola and what we tell people to do, where you would step in those. And then foot and mouth disease, mad cow disease, all of that.  So I have that into the entrances of all of my home. We wipe down everything, which is a mixture of water and Clorox before it comes into the house. I wear the mask with the gloves, and I have my wheelchair, which picks up all sorts of dirt. So I wipe that down in the garage. I actually have an indoor wheelchair and an outdoor wheelchair now so I take the outdoor wheelchair that's only use outside and it doesn't go back into the house. It doesn't pick anything up.  But I have that luxury right, to have that privilege that the American people through the VA has provided me with two wheelchairs. A lot of disabled people don't have that. They have to use the same wheelchair. Now you're tracking the disease into the house, potentially.  When I get home, the first thing, I do is I head back straight into the shower and take a shower and, you know, try to just decontaminate as much as possible, because, again, I live with a 2-year-old, a 5-year-old, and my mom is 79 years old. I mean, I live with a vulnerable population. So when we ask these women, working moms, to go back to work, you know, they have childcare, and then they are also many cases take watching out for their elderly parents as well.  And they live in multi-generational homes because that's all you can afford. And this disease spreads very easily in multi-generational homes. And we just you know, so as we move forward with reopening the economy, one of the things I'm insisting on is widespread and free testing, because if testing is in a cost of 60 bucks and you're forcing women to go back to work at their jobs and who can't afford childcare, what makes you think they made it to 50 bucks for a test. DB: I get that? I know you're busy. You've got to get home to that Zoom call. Happy, happy Mother's Day. Happy birthday from us to your mom, please. And thank you for all that you do. I appreciate it. TD: Thank you and Happy Mother's Day to you too, Dana.  DB: Sen. Duckworth, thank you so much for joining me, and a special thanks to our listeners as well."
17,CNN,"2. ""These are dirty politicians and dirty cops and some horrible people."" The President of the United States, ladies and gentlemen! 3. ""Was a perfect call."" Yes, we are still on this. 4. ""I got the President of Ukraine and said, 'Do you mind?' And he said, 'No. You go ahead and do it.'"" ""There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it ... It sounds horrible to me."" -- Donald Trump to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky 5. ""They tried to take down the president of the United States, a sitting, duly elected president of the United States before I even won."" In which Trump alleges that ""they"" -- not clear who he means -- was involved in a coup attempt to keep him from serving as president. His proof of this grand conspiracy? That former President Barack Obama allegedly knew about a call between Michael Flynn and Russian official Sergey Kislyak. 6. ""Rick Grenell is doing a fantastic job, an absolutely fantastic job as our number one person on intelligence. And he has been incredible. It's too bad the people that were sitting before him, I won't use names, didn't do anything. They didn't do a thing."" To translate Trump here: Past directors of national intelligence didn't do exactly what he wanted them to do. Grenell, the current DNI, does. 7. ""You look at Mueller, that was purely corrupt. And can you imagine with all the corruption having to do with Mueller."" Robert Mueller spent more than a decade as the FBI director -- under both Democratic and Republican presidents. Trump thinks Mueller was out to get him because Mueller once asked if he could have his dues back when he and his family left as members of Trump's golf course in Virginia. Yes, seriously.  8. ""No collusion."" Feels like I may have heard this before. 9. ""If it were a Republican, if it were reversed, if that were a Republican president or that were a -- let's say me, that would be the ultimate example but if that were a Republican president I believe he and Biden, sleepy Joe, was involved in this all also very much."" [Jim Halpert look] 10. ""And other people around President Obama were totally involved. And you'll see more and more things come out I think because like I know how it works."" To be clear on what Trump is alleging here: There was a broad-scale conspiracy by President Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and other top officials in their administration to undermine his presidency before it even began. How? Why? ""Because like I know how it works."" 11. ""He's dumb as a rock and he's a sick guy. There's something wrong with him."" The President of the United States on former FBI Director James Comey. Totally normal stuff! 12. ""You know, I told Bill Barr you had -- look, I would be absolutely entitled in theory the Chief Law Enforcement Officer in theory, but I said, you know what? I want Bill Barr to handle it."" I think what Trump is saying here is that he could have overseen the investigation into how the FBI conducted the Russia probe because he is, in his own words, the ""Chief Law Enforcement Officer."" In theory, of course. 13. ""If this were a Republican and if this were -- 25 people would be in jail for 50 years. They would be in jail for 50 years and it would have happened two years ago because everybody knew this was a hoax."" Well, he is the ""Chief Law Enforcement Officer."" In theory. 14. ""Sean -- you look at Sean Hannity, what he's done. I mean, he should get the equivalent of the Pulitzer Prizes."" Ah yes, the ""Pulitzer Prizes."" I love those prizes. 15. ""Tucker would do the Russia, Russia, Russia bit and laugh about it every night for two years."" Russia actively sought to interfere in our presidential election to help a candidate they thought would be better for their interests. HA HA HA. Oh wait. 16. ""Jeff Sessions was a disaster. He -- I made him -- I didn't want to make him attorney general, but he was the first senator to endorse me, so I felt a little bit of an obligation."" Loyalty, thy name is Trump. 17. ""He wasn't, you know, to me equipped to be attorney general, but he just wanted it, wanted it, wanted it. He was from a state that I love -- Alabama."" Wait. So Trump is admitting here that he didn't believe Jeff Sessions was qualified to be Attorney General but he named him to that job because Sessions really wanted it? And because Trump really likes the people of Sessions' home state? Uh, that seems like a weird thing to admit? 18. ""Jeff was just very weak and very sad, and when the name Russia was mentioned, just the word Russia, he immediately instead of being a man and saying this is a hoax, he recused himself. "" Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation to ensure there was no appearance of bias. As in, for the good of the country and its justice system. Or, in Trump's mind, because he wasn't ""man"" enough. 19. ""But I learned a lot by watching Richard Nixon. Of course, there was one difference -- one big difference. Number one, he may have been guilty, and number two, he had tapes all over the place."" So, Nixon ""may have been guilty?"" Wow. 20. ""I did nothing wrong, and there are no tapes, but I wish there were tapes in my case. But learn a lot from Richard Nixon and you don't do that."" OK, so Trump is saying he did nothing wrong when it comes to Ukraine and Russia. But that he learned from Nixon not to make tapes of his conversations. But, he did nothing wrong. The logic here is truly mind-blowing. 21. ""Had I not fired him, I probably wouldn't be speaking to you right now other than maybe I'd be talking to you about the private sector because I'd be in the private sector had I not -- because this was a takeover."" Following this logic: If Trump hadn't fired James Comey, the, uh, ""deep state"" (or someone) would have led a successful coup to remove him from office. Yeah, yeah. This all checks out. 22. ""That's when we found all of the emails and the texts where you had the two lovers, Strzok and Page, talking about how the insurance policy that if she doesn't win essentially we have an insurance policy, meaning if she doesn't win -- that's what we went through -- that we'll take him out. "" The Inspector General's report made very clear that neither Peter Stzrok nor Lisa Page influenced the start of the investigation into Russian interference nor was there any evidence of political bias on their part in how they behaved during the investigation. 23. ""We are draining the swamp like nobody's ever drained the swamp."" The best swamp-draining. Believe me. 24. ""We understand it now and you can never fully under the invisible enemy."" Wait. So do we now understand coronavirus? Or can we never fully grasp it? 25. ""It's a much smarter enemy than the enemy, than the enemy that I had that we just discussed. Much, much smarter than those characters. That's a bunch of -- you know, those are people that are not in the same league. This is a very brilliant enemy and it happens to be invisible."" In sum: Coronavirus > ""deep state."" Also, much more invisible. 26. ""And our tests are the best tests. They're calling up. We have tests that are the absolute best tests."" The best tests. Many people are saying it. 27. ""And I saved hundreds of thousands of lives. And Anthony Fauci admitted that."" ""I"" 28. ""We're leading in everything."" [nods head, looks around room tentatively] 29. ""And we just got very good polling today I guess you probably saw, very good polling."" What poll is Trump talking about? I have no idea. And, let's be honest, neither does he. My only guess? This Rasmussen tracking poll of Trump's approval. (And you should read this about Rasmussen.) 30. ""We've learned a lot of things about it and we may have fires and we're going to put the fires out."" What about if there are ""Little Fires Everywhere?"" [shows self out] 31. ""We created the greatest economy in the history of the world, best we've ever had, best employment numbers, best stock markets, best number of jobs."" Simply not accurate. 32. ""We'll be at 100,000, 110,000, higher -- the lower level of what was projected if we did the shutdown, but still you're talking about -- I say two Yankee stadiums of people."" ""Now we're going toward 50 -- I'm hearing, or 60,000 people. One is too many. I always say it. One is too many, but we're going toward 50 or 60,000 people. That's at the lower -- as you know the lower (end of the projections) was supposed to be 100,000 people."" -- Donald Trump, April 21 33. ""I've had many false accusations made. I can tell you that. Many."" More than a dozen women have accused Trump of sexual harassment. He said in the run-up to the 2016 election that he would sue each and everyone one of them. He hasn't sued a single one. 34. ""Law enforcement's going to look at it and have a good governor in the state and he's going to -- a very good governor actually, and he's going to be looking at it very strongly and he's going to do what's right, but it's a heartbreaking thing."" Trump somehow took a question about the killing of Ahmaud Arbery and turned it into a way to praise Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp. Which, well,OK. 35. ""It's the Comey group whether he is there or not the whole thing whether he was involved. I don't even know that but it's the Obama Justice Department."" Oh so Comey was involved in ""Bridgegate""? Big news! Oh wait, Trump just said he ""doesn't even know that."" So... 36. ""She lost the House before because of her stupidity. She's highly overrated, a bad woman. She doesn't even want to go to work. She's in California sitting in her expensive house. "" The President of the United States on the Speaker of the House. That is all. 37. ""UFC is having a big fight this weekend, which has become a hot sport, and which is going to be in Florida, and that's going to be great."" Dana White smiles. 38. ""Well, we'll be together. I'm going to Camp David, meeting, a big meeting with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Camp David is this very special place that nobody ever gets to see, but it's a great work environment, and we're going to have meetings on different things, and our military has never looked better."" The question? ""Mr. President, this Sunday is Mother's Day. What are your plans? What are you going to do for Melania?"" So, his will be doing meetings to honor the first lady. Moms always do love a good meeting to celebrate Mother's Day. Also, according to CNN's Kate Bennett, Melania is not going to Camp David with the president. (He is returning to the White House Sunday morning.) 39. ""I couldn't do any wrong, which is a big problem. Maybe that's why I ended up the way I ended up. I don't know. I couldn't do any wrong in her eyes."" Trump on his mom. Paging Dr. Freud... 40. 'Well you people are so professional you pretty much cleaned it. I think nobody wants to interview me now for the next two weeks or five weeks or whatever. That would be OK with me, by the way."" Yeah, this feels like a good place to end."
18,CNN,"You know why. It's because 47 states and the District of Columbia have ordered or recommended school closures for the rest of the school year. Teachers across the country have taken their lessons online to try and weather this pandemic.  So today, we'll highlight some of these teachers' struggles and successes in navigating remote learning.  I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent. And this is ""Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction.""  Chris Dier: We had to really try to make everything work in the virtual world. And that's challenging to do because most teachers like myself, we don't sign up for that. We sign up for the interaction.  We sign up for the collaboration, and we sign up for those human moments that you can't really replicate online. Gupta: That's Chris Dier, 2020 Louisiana Teacher of the Year and the finalist for 2020 National Teacher of the Year.  Dier: I teach at Chalmette High School in Louisiana, right outside of New Orleans.  Gupta: Dier teaches world history to seniors, and AP human geography to freshmen — I didn't know what that was. He said it's sort of like anthropology. He was inspired to teach, partly because of a formative personal experience. Dier: I was in high school when Hurricane Katrina hit. I was a senior. It was our second week, and it disrupted, you know, the entire region down here.  I was forced to go to Texas. I stayed in hotels and shelters and bounced around different schools. I missed out on a lot of big events that a lot of people look forward to their senior year.  Gupta: Sound familiar? Dier has a pretty good idea of what his current students probably feel. Dier: It's a time when you're supposed to be celebrating all of your hard work, your dedication, your accomplishments, when your family's supposed to watch you walk across that stage and cheer. So it's — it's a time that you'll never get to redo and you'll never get back. Gupta: And that's not just a loss for Dier's students. Some of them will be the first in their families to graduate from high school, and the ceremony would've been meaningful to their relatives as well.  Dier has students who are also dreamers; undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States as children. And he has students who are working essential jobs while they also balance online classes.  Learning online might seem easy enough if you're a student with a computer or the internet, but Dier also has students who didn't have the luxury of these tools. Dier: So a lot of students who originally didn't have internet when this happened, we were distributing work and packets and, you know, just literally papers when we were distributing food. But my district personally has been giving Chromebooks out to students who need them and trying to collaborate with local organizations to get hot spots to get kids connected, so I think teachers all across the country are doing everything they can to get kids online and to keep that, that learning going. Gupta: Esperanza Community School in Phoenix, Arizona, has also handed out Chromebooks and Wi-Fi hot spots to some of its students. But that's not all the school is providing. I think a lot of us forget how intergral schools are to our communities, even if you're not a student there.  Hannah Wysong teaches science and English at Eperanza, mostly to low-income students. She has helped distribute food boxes and gift cards to grocery stores. But as this pandemic drags on, Wysong and her colleagues are looking ahead to long-term challenges families might face.  Hannah Wysong: Food is available in a lot of places from schools and food banks. But as this has gone on for a couple of months and parents are not working or working less, the next step that we're working on right now is to build a fund for rental assistance. Gupta: And that's just the creative problem-solving Wysong has been a part of outside the classroom. After students have been set up with food and Wi-Fi is when her real job, and the real connection begins. And these teachers have come up with all kinds of new ways to do that as well.  Wysong: Something that we do normally at our school is have monthly family nights with movies or dinner or games or whatever it might be. And we were really mourning the loss of family night, and we decided to do a virtual dance party. So we got a local deejay from a radio station, and then we invited all of the families to get on Zoom. There were, I think, between 45 and 50 people on, between families and staff. It's pretty cute to see a bunch of little squares of third graders dancing. Gupta: Chris Wyckoff, who teaches American history to 11th graders in North Carolina, has taken advantage of our reliance on the internet to send his students some encouragement.  Chris Wyckoff: I've been sending out digital cards to let them know that I still see you. I still see your work. I still see you're working hard.  Gupta: Wyckoff has been proud of how well his students at the Johnston County Career and Technical Leadership Academy have taken to online classes. After all, they could easily just turn their video off and go do something else.  Wyckoff: Online learning, you know, it has its good and its bad even depending on the type of learner you are. And a lot of our students are capable of making the adjustment. The conditions at home, all of those — the social and emotional atmosphere of home versus the social emotional atmosphere at school, all of those things combine to either create an atmosphere for success or failure for the students.  Gupta: Chris Dineen — this is another Chris — said there were hiccups using video conferencing at first. Chris Dineen: We had a Zoom bomb the first or second day. Gupta: But his middle school students at Albuquerque Academy in New Mexico have come around.  Dineen: The students themselves have had to adapt to a totally different style of teaching, and they've actually had to become somewhat more accountable for their own behavior because of course, we can't see them and monitor them in the ways that we normally do. Gupta: Laurie Abrams finds this challenging, too. She's a special education teacher on Long Island and works with 3- to 5-year-olds who have special needs.  During normal times, her work is incredibly physical and requires personalized interactions with each student. These days, she struggles to get her students to sit still in front of the camera. Laurie Abrams: All kids do well with a schedule, but especially kids with special needs, listening issues and attending issues. They really need that. They need that routine. And the — you know, it's very hard — it's very hard for them. Gupta: But, like everyone else, Abrams has come up with ways to make it work. In fact, she borrowed one method of calming her students down from a children's yoga certification course.  Abrams: What I'm doing with my fingers is touching my thumb to my forefinger, middle finger, ring finger and pinkie. And so you have them do that. So it's four touches and then you just say, ""Peace begins with me."" And they understand that peace means quiet. And then we keep doing it.  And at any time when you feel anxious or that you need to calm down, you can just — you can just move your fingers like that.  Gupta: It's thoughtful. It's innovative. It's what's necessary. The teachers we spoke to said they've mostly worked out the kinks of remote learning, and they feel optimistic about finishing the year apart from their students. But in the long run? They're still not so sure.  Abrams: I think these kids are young enough that if it's just four months in the scheme of their long lives, this is not going to make the biggest difference because they didn't have four months of preschool. I think that in the fall, if kids can't go back to school, if they have to learn online, I think that's going to, you know, really impact this whole generation. Gupta: This won't surprise you, but Chris Dier, the Louisiana teacher whose own senior year was interrupted by Hurricane Katrina, said this pandemic highlights the need for more investment in education.  Dier: I know a lot of times when the economy starts to tank a bit, the first thing that gets cut is education. And people might say, well, why do we need as much, you know, money for education and budgets when they can do things virtually and whatnot. But at this time, I feel like that we need more, because we need more counselors, we need more social workers, we need more therapists, we need smaller classes. And that's how we're gonna get through this.  Gupta: These five teachers said the feedback they've gotten from students and parents has mostly been positive. But during this strange, difficult National Teacher Appreciation Week, it's nice for them to hear that their efforts haven't gone unnoticed.  So since they can't hug their teachers in person this year, we got some amazing shout-outs from students all over who want their teachers to know that their students are grateful.   Dalton Davis: My name is Dalton Davis. I am 7 years old from Philomath, Oregon, I want to say hi to my first-grade teacher, Mrs. Hobbs, and I miss her. Mira Singh: Hello, my name is Mira Singh, and I am in seventh grade. I would like to thank all of my amazing teachers. Aglaia: Hi, my name is Aglaia, and I'm a fourth grader. I want to give a shout-out to my awesome teacher, Mr. Fausto. He is there every day with a smile.  Cassie: Hi, my name is Cassie, I'm from Whittier, California. And thank you to all the teachers, especially my fourth-grade teacher, Mrs. Cudler.  Christa: And I'm Cassie's mom, Christa.

20,CNN,"Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Since the beginning of this pandemic, health care workers have been dealing with this virus head-on, putting their own physical health at risk. According to a CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] report released in April, more than 9,0000 health care workers have been infected with the coronavirus. ... And because of the limited data we have, that number is likely higher.  But we shouldn't forget the other risks our health care workers are facing. I'm talking about the emotional and psychological ones.  [Pots and pans banging, people cheering for health care workers] Gupta: Every night in cities around the world, we celebrate our health care workers. But the thing is, even before this pandemic, their jobs were demanding.  They're in high-stress life-and-death situations with long hours.  So in this episode, I want to talk about the pandemic's psychological cost to the people on the front lines -- and what's being done to help them.   I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent. And this is ""Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction.""     Dr. Philip Breen: She was a doctor. Every bit of the word that a doctor should be. She put her life on the line to take care of other people.    Gupta: That is Dr. Lorna Breen's father.  Last week, Dr. Breen, a New York City emergency room doctor, died by suicide.  She had actually contracted Covid-19 herself. After recovering she went back to work.   Breen: She was like the fireman who runs into the burning building to save another life and doesn't regard anything about herself.     Gupta: There is so much about this virus that is new and unfamiliar, making everyday life more challenging.  I've heard that from my colleagues.  Every day they wonder: Are they safe? And if their families and loved ones are safe as well.   I recently spoke with Dr. Steven McDonald. He's an ER doctor at the same hospital as Dr. Breen.   He's been on the front line for weeks, taking care of patient after patient ... after patient. New York has been the US' pandemic epicenter, with more than 321,000 people infected and 25,000 deaths.   I asked Dr. McDonald about how he's coping with his everyday reality as well as the loss of a colleague, and how he's taking care of his own mental health.       Gupta: So how is life, Dr. McDonald?      Dr. Steven McDonald: First of all, things are changing day-to-day. I think life a month ago looked very different than only two weeks ago than it does today. Thankfully, emergency department volumes are significantly down.  But also, as you can imagine, the tenor of my department is depressed. We just lost one of our faculty members, one of our physicians. And so there's definitely a pall that's been cast over my department -- in addition to this pandemic.   Gupta: I'm so sorry to hear that. I don't think people always recognize both the physical and psychological toll on frontline workers like yourself. At what point for you did it become something that was personally frightening?  McDonald: As we were approaching the peak, I would walk into the emergency room and it was in a state of chaos. And it was overwhelming to an extent that I had never really seen before. It felt -- I keep describing it as though a caged animal had been kind of let loose, and no one could see it or get it back into the cage.      Gupta: Wow. You know, I've been -- I finished med school in 1993, so I've been doing this for a long time. And typically, you know, the family is there. There's an additional line of support.  But what you're describing is people who are coming in, almost always by themselves because families can't come in. And now they find themselves in a position where they may suddenly die. It's tough. I don't mean to paint it so stark, but it sounds like that is the reality, at least in some of these situations.  Let me ask: How worried were you about contracting the virus yourself?      McDonald: If I'm being honest, you know, early on, I think this was probably mid-March when this was first starting. I had a moment at home by myself, borne out of complete irrationality, where I suddenly was convinced that I was going to die of this. I can't explain to you where that came from. I think it was just maybe having read a couple too many of these cases and having talked to a couple of colleagues who had pronounced young people dead of this.  And I just suddenly was gripped by that conviction. And it was frightening. It was really frightening, just to feel like there's nothing that I can do in this. I have truly no agency over my death in some regard. There's no amount of PPE that will protect me from this. And I know that to be irrational. I know that to not be true, but I was so gripped by it in one moment. Gupta: I agree with you, and I think that's a really interesting way to put it. You know, we do all the right things, but there are things in life, especially with a microscopic virus that's inexplicable. So you're really putting yourself at risk. McDonald: Right. Gupta: Did you ever think about sitting it out? Saying, you know what? It's not worth it.    McDonald: You know, I did have a moment where -- I think it was a Sunday night and I had my first shift in a couple of weeks on the Monday. And I was, to be totally honest with you, I was a wreck. I was a wreck. I was calling family and friends. And I was really upset.  And I was thinking about the number of people who I was going to have to pronounce dead or have to have end-of-life conversations with. And I found it so overwhelming in the abstract on that Sunday night.   I thankfully have a great support network, a great therapist -- and spoke with her a bit and was able to sort of pull myself together and work and be a physician the next day. But that was a difficult 24 hours. Gupta: You know, Steven, it's always struck me that even within the medical community, there is still a stigma about seeking therapy, seeking mental health support. Yet it's so important, maybe never more important, than it is right now.  Do you sense that stigma? I mean, has it manifested at all in your life?  McDonald: I mean, you know, absolutely. I would say physicians don't talk about mental health issues. I don't know if any job is really that open about this, but I think medicine in general breeds a culture of silence about this.    Gupta: And you do hear about physicians who die by suicide. Compared to the general community, it's typically higher across the board.  There was a lot of news about Dr. Breen lately. And I know you knew her somewhat. When you heard this, were you surprised?  McDonald: Absolutely. I was completely floored. She always -- again, I only knew her in a professional capacity, but she struck me as someone who was so self-possessed and so capable, really tough as nails and able to deal with any situation head-on. And, you know, I esteem all of my colleagues as being that tough.     Gupta: Has there been anything good that's come out of this for you?    McDonald: So I think there has been incredible camaraderie among physicians. At the peak of this, we had orthopedists and urologists coming down and managing critically ill patients and doing blood draws and doing things that are way below their level of training just to help out, and to see colleagues who were so willing to be part of this effort was really inspiring.  You know, secondly, and I think this remains to be borne out, but one hope that I have: This virus, I think is sort of peeling back the onion skin and showing us at the core of American society, things that really need attention on a federal and legislative level. So, the inequalities that this is exposing, the problems in the health care system that this is exposing.  And I hope that these are conversations that are started and carry weight and are not forgotten after we beat this thing.       Gupta: Camaraderie as well, you're absolutely right about -- I've seen that in our own hospital. Although it does make me think of this joke that you probably heard: the definition of a double-blind study?  McDonald: No?   Gupta: Two orthopedic surgeons trying to read an EKG.     McDonald: Hahahaha. I love that. I will not be telling that to my orthopedic colleagues, but I love that.    Gupta: I want to ask you about, you know, if there's been a best moment and a worst moment.  McDonald: Yes. Worst moment for me was. ... It was during the peak, and I was coming into a shift. I received sign-out on probably 40 patients who were all critically ill. And so I was in this awful situation where I was pulled into one room to be with a critical patient who was dying. And then the nurse comes and gets me and says, you also have a critical patient who's dying in this other room.  And so I run through to this other room, and this woman is near death. Her heart has nearly stopped. Her oxygen levels are falling. She's already on a ventilator. She was in her late 80s.  And the team is, the team of residents is looking to me, to ask: What are we going to do when this woman's heart stops, as it appears it's going to in the next 10 seconds, 15 seconds? And this woman had no established advanced directives. And we had made multiple attempts to get in touch with family and were unable to.  And, you know, all the data shows that someone of this age who's already on a ventilator, this person is not going to live no matter what interventions you make. And so, talking to you now, it seems very obvious to not attempt to prolong life. But in that moment, it was very hard for me to make that decision. It was -- there was no clarity about it.   And so, I declined to perform CPR. But then I felt terribly about that in the moment. That was really the lowest moment I've had during this, where I just felt like I ended someone's life without any data.  I guess, in terms of bright spots of this -- so you're familiar, I'm sure, with the 7 o'clock clap for providers and essential workers. And so, after Lorna Breen's passing, I was working that next day. And we did at 7 o'clock go out to the front of the emergency department.  All the doctors who were able and the nurses and everyone, and we just had a hell of a clap for those whom we've lost. And it doesn't in any way redeem what's happened. But it was a really nice moment of camaraderie and to celebrate the accomplishments of those whom we've lost, including Dr. Breen.  Gupta: Wow. Well, I mean, going back to the worst moment for a second, for what it's worth, Steven, that was a tough decision. I'm sorry that obviously left such a mark on you. But from what you described, you know, it was the correct decision.  McDonald: Thank you.      Gupta: Do you worry that you're suffering from post-traumatic stress?   McDonald: It's hard to say. I mean, I think like post-traumatic stress disorder, when you're in the thick of it, you don't think about it. And it's only once things calm down that you begin to have things like flashbacks or intrusive thoughts.  So far, I've been very fortunate in that I have not had those symptoms, but I can't tell you with any certainty that I won't in the future. And so that is a perpetual source of anxiety and concern.       Gupta: Well, I mean, I will clap harder and cheer even louder after hearing your story about how that made you feel. I mean, it's the least I think that people can do and people really owe you a debt of gratitude. So, thank you very much.  There'll be books written about the sort of work that you've done. I know you're in the midst of it right now, so it's hard to sense that, but thank you.  McDonald: Thank you. Thank you so much.  Gupta: Like Dr. McDonald said, doctors are facing so many challenges right now. There are these long, demanding shifts, the risk of exposure to the virus and the number of patients that are dying, which is unlike anything we have ever dealt with before.       Dr. John Krystal, Yale University professor of psychiatry and neuroscience and Yale-New Haven Hospital chief of psychiatry: You know you think of the first wave of illness being the wave of patients coming in and presenting with illness. But for these health care workers, the stresses are somewhat cumulative.  And so you can think of a second wave of stress coming through for the Covid health care workers.     Gupta: That was Dr. John Krystal. He heads the psychiatry department at both Yale University and Yale-New Haven Hospital. He's been tasked with leading a group that identifies health care providers who are struggling and provides them with support.     Krystal: One kind of support that we have is giving people a place they can drop into any day they want, every day, five days a week. We have what we call stress and resilience town halls. They're open to everybody in the community: staff, trainees, doctors. The idea was they should connect to deal with the isolation that they're often feeling. They should unload, you know, they should just share what it is that they're going through and then to learn a few skills. And so we teach people relaxation skills, and we teach people sleep hygiene. And so far, I think in our community, over 1,400 people have made use of them.      Gupta: Dr. Krystal and his team also established a buddy system -- pairing health care workers with their peers. And then they dispatched volunteers to provide psychological support to anyone who wants it, over the phone.       But both Dr. Krystal and Dr. McDonald bring up a more deeply rooted issue about the culture of medicine.     Krystal: You know, some of the challenges are that some of the characteristics that we have historically admired most about physicians: They're willing to sacrifice themselves for others, their reluctance to complain about things.  All of those are admirable, wonderful traits, but somehow, we haven't always inculcated in the values of our medical system that self-care is as much a duty and a responsibility as caring for the patient.   And my hope is that this is an opportunity to have broader discussion about that. And to make it OK for more doctors who need help to seek help.     Gupta: This pandemic has really tried and tested the best of us.     But I am thankful that mental health services are available for our doctors and medical workers who need it the most.    A fund was recently set up in honor of Dr. Breen -- it's called the Dr. Lorna Breen Heroes' Fund, and it's there to provide mental health services to medical workers. It's my sincere hope that the support that's been marshaled to help health care workers in this pandemic will last beyond this moment -- that they'll become a fixture in the way we think about care.    We'll be back tomorrow. Thanks for listening.   "
21,CNN,"But with concerns of Covid-19 cases overrunning hospitals, Dia was faced with a question many of us are asking right now: Should I still go in to see my doctor? Today, we'll talk about when to seek care not related to Covid-19, and how doctors and hospitals are reaching their patients from a distance. I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent. And this is ""Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction."" Sue-Wah-Sing: It's like, running and being dehydrated and having like a significant cramp on your side. Gupta: At the beginning of April, in the middle of this pandemic, Dia Sue-Wah-Sing began having some pain. At first, she didn't know what it was.  Sue-Wah-Sing: Oh, maybe I just like slept funny, or you know, sometimes you're like, maybe I'm just sitting in a weird spot because we're all doing a lot of Zoom and trying to get cozy for those. But I'd had it for a while, and I had it for a few days.  Gupta: Then, Dia began to recognize the symptoms. She has a history of kidney stones and realized that that would explain the pain.  Fortunately, Dia was scheduled for a routine ultrasound on April 15. Because she was nervous about Covid-19, Dia initially wasn't sure if she should go in for her appointment. So she called the hospital and spoke to a nurse about what they were doing to keep patients safe. Sue-Wah-Sing: She talked about general precautions that the hospital had in place. So there are checkpoints, they have less entrances open. You know, there is kind of that basic medical screening. So, you know, have you traveled? Do you have a fever? Do you have a new cough?  Gupta: After speaking with the nurse, Dia decided to go in for her appointment. So, on April 15, she drove to the hospital and had an ultrasound of her kidney. Sue-Wah-Sing: And it was like kind of being at the airport. There were two booth setups that were legitimately like health-screening checkpoints.  So it's like there's hand-sanitizing stations, sanitize your hands, come to the booth, say who you are, check in. And in the waiting room, they had it cornered off. And they had 2 meters or 6 feet apart for the waiting room chairs. So you could only sit in selected chairs.  Gupta: Dia was in and out of the hospital in less than an hour. Later that day, she got a call from her doctor to discuss the results. Sue-Wah-Sing: We went through my symptoms, my imaging. And the next steps. So I thought it was kind of nice because I think sometimes your physicians don't always look at your stuff until you're like, hold on. Who are you again?  But I think they have the time to take a breath right now, that they actually are coming to the table prepared in the telemedicine appointments. So it's like, huh, this is the most efficient it's been. I should do this all the time. Instead of, you know, being there for two-thirds of the day.  Gupta: Because of the coronavirus pandemic, Dia's experience has become a common one. Hospitals have quickly taken their services online, doctors are seeing their patients on video or over the phone, and medical records are being shared more often electronically. It's a process that minimizes exposure to the virus and could also save people some travel and wait time. These practices are a part of what's known as telemedicine. The number of medicare beneficiaries who received telemedicine visits rose from 10,000 a week to 300,000 a week in the last week of March, according to the Wall Street Journal.   To learn more about it, I spoke to my colleague Dr. Gregory Esper, a neurologist and also director of telemedicine at Emory University. Gupta: Whenever I'm looking at new technology as a doctor, but also as a journalist in the back of my mind, I'm asking myself, is this technology just a substitute for what already exists or is it adding value in a way that this technology can do differently in some way?  How about with telemedicine? Is it just a substitute for an in-person visit? Or can it do things that you otherwise wouldn't be able to do?  Dr. Gregory Esper, professor and vice chairman of Emory University's department of neurology: One of my favorite examples is there was a Parkinson's patient who was falling at home, and the Parkinson's physician looked at their environment and noticed that there were multiple trip hazards in place on the floor and directed the patients to take care of all of those trip hazards by moving the shoes or moving this or moving that to clear walkways.  So that is something we haven't seen before, which is an advantage to telehealth. But here's another one. Let's say that the patient desires more frequent contact with their provider, but they live 200 miles away. Telemedicine becomes the venue by which that contact happens.  Gupta: So as a neurologist, if you're doing a telehealth visit the right way. What does that entail? What does that visit look like?   Esper: Well, it starts far before I see the patient. It starts when our staff is contacting the patients and asking them if they would be comfortable to do a telemedicine visit. Then we schedule the appointment, and we'll have the medical assistants prep those patients. And then the patient will be ready for the physician.  And then we open the video and then we, we actually begin the conversation with a consent. We actually will ask the patient, is it OK for us to continue with this telemedicine visit? And the patient will generally say, yes.  And then we proceed. We do the history. Tell me about your headache? What side is it on? Patient might point to the side. Is your vision affected? Do you have nausea? And we then proceed to a physical examination.  There are so many things that we can do on video that will help us confirm our hypothesis for what's happening in the history.  Gupta: When the patient is seeing you or the health care provider on a screen, what are you seeing in addition to the patient? Are you able to look at previous laboratory values that the patient may have had drawn through their blood or previous scan results?  Esper: Everything that is accessible in an in-person visit is accessible in a telemedicine visit. And we have actually implemented systemwide capabilities for image capture where we are asking the patients to upload their MRIs, or their prior scans, or we can obtain those from partner organizations that have electronic connections with us.   Gupta: It's been really interesting, Dr. Esper, with my kids at home and doing Zoom school. You know, one of the things that comes up sometimes with three kids is just the speed of the connection and then downloading things at the same time.  How much of a factor is that just in terms of the quality of the online services?   Esper: Well, I think it ranges from people who actually don't have internet service in their area, for which we do telephonic visits, to those who have spotty coverage, in which the video is a little bit choppy.  And part of getting comfortable with the technology is learning how to mitigate those factors during the examination.   Gupta: Because of the novel coronavirus, the government has temporarily allowed Medicare and some other health insurers to cover these sorts of procedures. We're going to see how that carries out going forward. But how is the coverage?   Esper: Medicare has really stepped up and has made it easy and not a barrier, I would say, for patients to get care because the reimbursement is at parity compared to what it was before.   Gupta: I remember hearing at the White House when they said there is going to be a significant investment in telehealth necessary, because of the contagiousness of this virus.  How much has telehealth changed? Just even over the last few months now?   Esper: Well, I can give you some statistics from Emory. We basically were doing zero outpatient telemedicine at the beginning of March.  Since that time, we have trained and certified almost 2,200 physicians, residents, fellows to do telemedicine and do it in the right way. And we have seen almost 50,000 patients since the beginning of March through audio video telemedicine.   Gupta: So from basically zero, as far as patient care, to 50,000. Is this now here to stay? Or will it go back, do you think, once the Covid pandemic is addressed?   Esper: Well, I can tell you that my hope is that it is here to stay because I think it is a critical care model for us to be able to continue, especially for those patients who have difficulty making it to appointments, that potentially need more frequent follow-up; for patients where you need to see them in their own environment, which is their home.  And we hope there is no going back. It's not the solution for everything, but it certainly is an arrow in our quiver for how to take care of patients effectively.   Gupta: Telemedicine is being used for so many health services right now. So, for those of you who are wondering whether you can or should get your mammogram, see your dentist, take your child to the pediatrician, see someone for your mental health. ... Here's what CNN found: For preventative check-ups, like mammograms or colonoscopies, until things change, you might have to wait until your hospital reopens before doing it. But do check with your doctor for details. For parents, if it's urgent, try to take your child to the ER at a chidren's hospital, if possible. If it's not urgent, talk to your primary care doctor and get their advice. As for dentists, they're unfortunately at very high risk of catching the virus because it spreads through droplets of saliva in the air. That's why most dentist offices have canceled everything but emergency procedures. But no matter the situation, still call your dentist, and they'll walk you through it. If you're hearing a pattern here, you're right. The bottom line is, if you're feeling unwell, still call your doctor. They may even have more time nowadays to take your call. They can help you figure it out and make the safest possible plan for your care.  But if it's an emergency, especially if you're experiencing chest pain, or shortness of breath, or stroke symptoms, don't hesitate then. Just call 911 and get to the nearest emergency room.  We'll be back tomorrow. Thanks for listening."

23,CNN,"As part of the Russia investigation, the committee interviewed a number of top Trump officials and members of President Donald Trump's family in 2017 and early 2018, including Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, Steve Bannon, Corey Lewandowski and Hope Hicks. The committee's interview with Roger Stone led to his conviction on perjury charges for lying to the panel.  The committee also spoke to top Obama administration officials like former FBI Director James Comey, former national security adviser Susan Rice and former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates. But the transcripts have yet to be released. Republicans have claimed Schiff was delaying their publication, and Grenell wrote that 43 of the transcripts were completed in June 2019, according to the Examiner. But the committee spokesperson charged that ODNI held up the declassification review for several of the remaining transcripts at the request of the White House. In September 2019, the committee voted to release the 43 transcripts that had been completed. At that closed-door meeting, Schiff told the committee that in March 2019 ODNI said it intended to share some transcripts with the White House because they ""implicated White House equities."" The committee told ODNI not to share with the White House and the agency did not do so. ""The White House has, in a sense, hijacked what should have been an uncontroversial straightforward review of congressional transcripts to identify and redact any classified information, and attempted to expand it into an unsolicited after the fact review for information purportedly protected by executive privilege,"" Schiff said, according to a transcript of the committee meeting. Rep. Devin Nunes of California, the top Republican on the panel, found some rare agreement with Schiff, saying the transcripts were delayed due to ""ODNI dragging its feet."" But the release never happened following the vote, as the panel's attention quickly turned toward Ukraine and the impeachment inquiry. Now it appears all 53 transcripts will be released in one batch. ""The Committee received a letter yesterday from ODNI stating that 'as of today, the interagency review of the remaining ten transcripts has been completed,' and providing new redactions. After more than a year of unnecessary delay, the ODNI has finally concluded its protracted classification review of the Committee's transcripts, and it also appears the White House has now abandoned its improper insistence on reviewing key transcripts, which the Committee appropriately rejected,"" the committee spokesperson said.  The committee said it was now going to review the redactions before the transcripts would be released, taking a swipe at Grenell for an ""overtly political role"" in the process. ""We are now reviewing the proposed redactions from ODNI based on classification, law enforcement sensitivity or items ODNI requests be for official use only,"" the spokesperson said. ""Given the overtly political role now played by the acting DNI, including the leak of his letter, this committee and the public can have little confidence that his determinations are made on the merits. This process had already taken far too long, most notably because the ODNI improperly held up the declassification review and release of several transcripts at the request of the White House.""  The Republican report from the panel's Russia investigation in 2018 concluded Russia had interfered but found no evidence of collusion between members of Trump's team and Russian officials. Democrats, however, argued that the committee had failed to take steps like subpoenaing the witnesses for records or refusing to answer the panel's questions. A year later, then-special counsel Robert Mueller concluded his investigation into Russian election interference, which did not establish a criminal conspiracy between Trump's team and Russia but did find evidence that people inside and associated with the Trump campaign had welcomed and encouraged Russian activity that they thought could help their candidate win.  The Senate Intelligence Committee's Russia investigation, which began in 2017, is at last nearing an end. Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, said Tuesday that the committee's final chapter of its report on Russian interference had been written, and he asked Director of National Intelligence nominee Rep. John Ratcliffe to expedite the declassification process for that document to be released publicly."
24,CNN,"The news comes a little more than a week after CNN reported that the task force might soon begin slowly scaling back its number of meetings altogether, according to a source, as Trump and Vice President Mike Pence schedule other events. Officials said that the task force's end may never be officially announced and no clear replacement group appears ready to commence in its wake, the Times reported. A second senior administration official told CNN, ""This does not mean doctors are being removed from the equation or pushed out."" The second senior administration official told CNN that the White House is shifting its focus toward reopening the economy ""and putting Americans back to work."" That shift will take place over the next few weeks and doctors such as Dr. Deborah Birx and Dr. Anthony Fauci, who have been prominent figures in the President's task force briefings with reporters, will still play ""an important advisory role"" in the process, the second senior administration official said. ""Members of the task force will continue providing input, though the group but will not be meeting as regularly as the focus changes toward vaccines, therapeutics, testing, and ultimately reopening the economy,"" the second senior administration official said. ""Keep in mind the task force was always a temporary arrangement. Health experts will continue providing input even while not meeting together every day."" Pence confirmed to reporters on Tuesday that the White House is having conversations about when the timing would be right to disband the task force. The comments were made in a small briefing with reporter to which CNN was not invited. The vice president's office later provided a partial transcript of the comments. ""We're having conversations about that and about what the proper time is for the task force to complete its work and for the ongoing efforts to take place on an agency-by-agency level,"" Pence said, adding that the White House has begun to discuss a ""transition plan with FEMA."" Pence added that the White House is ""starting to look at the Memorial Day window, early June window as a time when we could begin to transition"" away from the task force. One source familiar with the task force conversations said that one of the reasons they are starting to discuss the phase down is because Pence wants to get out and travel more. He can't lead a task force while doing that, such that it would be better for the Department of Health and Human Services and other relevant agencies to take the lead at that point, the source added. When asked if the President pushed this idea, the source insisted Trump did not but added he is not opposed to it. It's another sign that change is looming on the state of the federal response.  The task force held an in-person meeting Tuesday morning -- its first in-person meeting since Friday. On Monday, The New York Times reported the Trump administration has an internal model projecting a rise up to about 3,000 daily US deaths from coronavirus by June 1. Trump has been anxious to reopen the nation and push an economic message, as his campaign had been counting on the economy to boost him in November but had been forced to change tactics.  He has been notably inconsistent in his response to states reopening, expressing seemingly vacillating comments on Georgia's reopening as recently as last week. He also sided with protesters -- some of whom were armed -- in Michigan last week for their protests demanding the state reopen after Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer extended her emergency declaration keeping some businesses shuttered. This story has been updated with additional information and reporting on Tuesday."
25,CNN,"I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent. And this is ""Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction."" Gupta: There are currently only two types of coronavirus tests available in the United States. Because I'm a health care worker who still takes care of patients in the hospital, I've had both of them.  Doctor: I'm going to give you a little poke over here. OK?  Gupta: OK. Doctor: Poke. You doing OK? Gupta: Yep. Doctor: And just like that, we're all done. Gupta: That's it. OK. Doctor: Let's get you wrapped up.  Gupta: Early on, there were some significant delays in testing, and there was also the release of a flawed test, which really put us far behind.  Since then, there have been a lot of unauthorized, unvalidated tests, which have flooded the market.  The most common and most accurate test we have is called a PCR test -- a polymerase chain reaction test. Now that's the one that detects whether or not someone is currently infected with Covid-19. It involves a saliva test in some cases, or more commonly, a nasal swab. CNN's [Anchor] Brooke Baldwin referred to it as a ""brain tickler."" Brooke Baldwin, CNN News Anchor: Oooooh! Doctor: One more. ... All done. Baldwin: [giggle] Gupta: So that gets sent off to a lab, where the genetic material is extracted. And because there's such a small amount of that genetic material, it is then amplified. That's the polymerase chain reaction. If all goes well, results usually come back within a few hours, but it can take a few days if you have to send it to a lab somewhere. Then there are the antibody tests. Those are the ones that can determine whether or not someone has had Covid-19 in the past and might have some immunity to it now. Those involve collecting a small blood sample, either through a needle in the vein or through a blood spot sample.  But here's the problem: Antibody tests have not been consistently accurate. There are a lot of bad tests out there, and it's still unclear how much those antibodies might protect you from the virus in the future.  When you're testing for the virus, the biggest problem would be having a false negative. Why? Because you would think that you don't have the virus, and then you might go back out into the community, into a nursing home, into a hospital -- and potentially infect people.  With the antibody test, what you're really hoping to avoid is a false positive. Then, someone might feel that they have the antibodies, thus feel that they are protected, go out into the community, to a hospital, to a nursing home and spread the virus.  So with the diagnostic virus test, you really have to reduce false negatives; with the antibody test, you really have to reduce false positives.  Kevin de León, senior fellow at University of Southern California's Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy: The promise of the immunology test to find out if we have the antibodies is huge. Gupta: That's Kevin de León, senior fellow at the University of Southern California's Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy. The institute supports test sites across Los Angeles. De León: This can influence policy makers at the local, at the state and federal level. That can actually inform us when it comes to social distancing. If I'm immune, and scientifically I've been proven to be immune, then I can reenter the workforce and I can play a bigger role in making sure we're safer.  Gupta: A company called Roche announced that it received emergency-use authorization -- EUA -- for an antibody test it claims is more accurate than most.  Roche says it has already started shipping its new test to leading labs around the world. Here's Roche CEO Severin Schwan. Severin Schwan, Roche CEO: It's really special because it's so accurate, it's almost near-perfect accuracy. And what that allows us is to really reliably test whether a person has been infected by the coronavirus or not, irrespective of whether you had symptoms or not.  Gupta: Now there's another kind of test that could be useful here. It's called an antigen test. Again, the test for the virus is the PCR or diagnostic test. The test for the antibody is called a serology test.  And now the antigen tests look for a protein on the surface of the virus. You may have already had one of these if you've ever had a test for strep throat or the flu. Here's the problem: A reliable antigen test for the coronavirus isn't yet available in the United States, but the hope is that we'll soon have something that works kind of like an at-home pregnancy test, where a test strip would change color to tell if you might have the virus. Frederick Nolte is a pathology professor and the head of coronavirus testing at the Medical University of South Carolina.  Frederick Nolte, Medical University of South Carolina professor and director of clinical laboratories: Antigen detection has been part of the diagnostic landscape for a number of years, and it has a number of appeals. It can be done relatively quickly, it's inexpensive, it can be deployed in a number of clinical settings outside of the laboratory, near to patients. But the chief concern with it has been the sensitivity.  Gupta: And a low sensitivity means a high false negative. And with high false negatives, people feel that they don't have the virus, and they go back out into the community and potentially continue the spread. So ""How available are PCR and antibody tests to the general public?"" is probably the question I get more than any other. Well, as of Monday, Johns Hopkins University's Covid Tracking Project was reporting over 7 million people in the United States have been tested. And they mean the diagnostic, or PCR test, in this case.   But again, the initial rollout of those tests was fraught with problems. And that caused major delays in the country's early response to the pandemic. Those problems are being addressed now, but there are still supply chain shortages.  The PCR test requires certain transport mediums, reagents and, yes, nasal swabs. And those things have been in short supply.  But just last week, the mayor of Los Angeles announced free diagnostic testing for all of the county's residents.  Eric Garcetti, mayor of Los Angeles: Because we know the 10 million residents in L.A. county need that. It's critical for us opening up in the future. Gupta: That's Mayor Eric Garcetti on CNN. Garcetti: And we wanted to be the first big city in America to take the advice of doctors around the country saying, ""You have to find the silent spreaders. This is a silent killer,"" that people without symptoms who can spread this are a critical piece of knowledge in order to open up in the future. Gupta: And in New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio says the city will produce its own Covid-19 test kits, in partnership with a 3D printing company. Bill de Blasio, mayor of New York City: We realized we had to find another source. The global market wasn't working. There weren't sources around this country that were reliable enough, so we decided we would make our own. And this has had to be put together very quickly. So we're really in uncharted territory creating these test kits in New York City.  Gupta: Again, it's these nasal swabs that have been in such short supply in so many places around the country. Now there are also plenty of antibody tests floating around that haven't been reviewed or validated by the FDA. The agency said Monday that it was tightening its policy to keep unproven and even fraudulent tests from entering the market. It's been a big problem. In one study of 12 antibody tests, four were shown to deliver false positive results more than 10% of the time. Remember, if you're testing for antibodies and you get a false positive, people may incorrectly assume they now have the antibodies and are protected and then go out into public and keep spreading. You really want to get that false positive rate under 2% -- as low as possible, really. The future could lie in at-home testing. Antigen tests would be the easiest to mass-produce for home use. But again, like I said, we don't yet have a reliable antigen test for Covid-19.  White house coronavirus task force member Dr. Deborah Birx said this last month, on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" Dr. Deborah Birx, coronavirus response coordinator, White House Coronavirus Task Force: We have to have a breakthrough innovation in testing. We have to be able to detect antigens, rather than constantly trying to detect the actual live virus or the viral particles itself. And to really move into antigen testing.  Gupta: If an antigen test is approved and mass-produced, it may serve as a valuable screening tool, but it's probably not going to replace the PCR saliva or swab tests when it comes to diagnosing Covid-19. The antigen test in this case would just be used to screen. The PCR test would still be the most accurate.  According to The Guardian, scientists working for the U.S. military have designed a PCR test that has the potential to detect the virus as early as just 24 hours after it's contracted. That could help stop infected people from spreading the virus before they even show symptoms. And keep in mind, a lot of people never show symptoms but can still spread the virus. It's another promising ""maybe.""  And remember this: Testing does need to go hand in hand with contact tracing. Once you find out who is infected, that person needs to be isolated. And then everyone who has had close contact with that person needs to be traced. And sometimes those people need to be quaratined as well. Test, trace and hopefully treat.  My colleague Anderson Cooper and I asked Bill Gates about this at CNN's town hall last week.  Bill Gates, philanthropist: If you want to try and open up, this contact-tracing thing has got to be taken seriously. South Korea took it seriously. It looks like there's an effort in New York that [former] Mayor Bloomberg is helping out with that will do some of that. That's a necessary part of reopening is to have the quick turnaround tests that actually low-income people can get access to, but the contact tracing to follow up so those people hear very quickly if they've been infected. Gupta: Things are getting better, but it is clear that we're still not where we need to be. It's a brutal truth, but one that needs to be told.  There aren't enough PCR or diagnostic tests to meet demand, and the antibody tests haven't been as accurate as they need to be. And this is exactly why I keep advising people to behave like you have the virus. A lack of tests means a lack of knowledge. The availability of quicker, easier and more accurate testing is crucial to get the country back on its feet.  We'll be back tomorrow. Thanks for listening."

27,CNN,"Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Since I started reporting on the coronavirus, I've heard a lot of myths and theories about it. The outbreak has unleashed so much information, the World Health Organization has called it an infodemic.  And there's so much misinformation that goes along with it. Today I'm going to try and set the record straight on some inaccurate information that's been circulating on social media and the internet. I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent. And this is ""Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction.""     Gupta: Number one: Does remdesivir cure coronavirus?  Well first of all, last week, the Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency-use authorization for remdesivir.  Remdesivir is not a cure. But it's a start, and it could be a very important start. This is an experimental drug, an antiviral. I've been reporting on it since 2014, when it was tested as an experimental treatment for Ebola. It didn't work back then, but recently, a government-funded study found that hospitalized patients who took remdesivir intraveneously recovered about four days faster than patients who didn't.   The benefit on average was about 31 percent. That's similar to the effect that the drug Tamiflu has on the flu. Tamiflu also doesn't cure patients, but it can reduce how long they are sick and how severe that sickness is. So let me tell you what this FDA emergency-use authorization really means: The FDA is allowing the use of this drug remdesivir for adults and children suspected or confirmed to have Covid-19, who also have severe disease, which includes low blood oxygen levels.  For now, this is a medication that has to be administered in a hospital through an IV, by a health care provider. Now, keep in mind, emergency use authorization doesn't mean that this is an FDA-approved drug -- but it is a sign that the FDA believes that the benefits of this drug outweigh the risks in certain patients. Now I want to remind you that this study has nothing to do with how soon we might see a vaccine for the coronavirus.   Number two: Injesting disinfectants can possibly treat the virus.  Listener: Just to make sure, you shouldn't drink Lysol, right?  Gupta: I know you probably know the answer to this one already. And the reason that we're talking about it is because it still seems to be a source of confusion for some people. Let me be clear about this. Under no circumstances should you ingest or inject any cleaning products. Even a very small amount can get you very sick and possibly even kill you. Lysol's manufacturer issued a statement clarifying that its products should never be administered into the human body.  Still, there was a reported uptick in calls in places like Maryland and Illinois about people ingesting disinfectants to try and kill the virus.  This is dangerous. It won't work, and it could get you really sick. So let me repeat it once more. Don't drink any cleaning products. Number three:  Listener: Can I get the coronavirus through drinking regular tap water or in a swimming pool?  Gupta: Well, a little bit of good news here. You don't need to worry about getting Covid-19 in your tap water. According to the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention], most municipal drinking water systems should remove or inactivate the virus.    As for swimming pools, there's no evidence that the virus can be spread through the water in pools, hot tubs or water play areas. Proper maintenance along with the use of disinfection agents should inactivate the virus in the water.  But that doesn't mean pools may not be shut down in certain areas this summer. Health officials advise staying at least 6 feet away from others because the virus is a respiratory disease. In other words, you probably won't get the coronavirus from the water, but you could get it from someone close to you in the water.  Number four: The novel coronavirus is no worse than the flu. Two doctors in Bakersfield, California recently held a press conference to declare just that. Dr. Dan Erickson: Is the flu less dangerous than Covid? Let's look at the death rates. No, it's not. They're similar in prevalance and in death rate. So we are saying that our response now, now that we know the facts, it's time to get back to work.  Gupta: That was Dr. Dan Erickson. He and another doctor came under fire for downplaying Covid-19.  In fact, the American College of Emergency Physicians called the claims reckless, untested and inconsistent with any current science or epidemiology regarding Covid-19.   It is true that there are similarities, but Dr. Anthony Fauci [director of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases], for example, has warned that coronavirus could be 10 times more lethal than the flu. Here's one thing to keep in mind. Flu can be very deadly. About 0.1% of people who become infected with the flu will die from it.  In any given year, 30 million people to 40 million people may become infected. And that means 30,000 to 40,000 people will die.  But here's some big differences. First of all, the flu's been around for a while. So if you've been around on this planet for a while, you probably have some immunity to it, even if the flu virus changes a bit season to season.  And finally, there is a vaccine for the flu. Now, the vaccine may not protect you entirely. But it could shorten the duration if you get it.  By the way, that doctor's video, which has been shared on YouTube, has since been taken down for violating the platform's policy on misinformation. Number five: 5G networks are spreading the virus.   Donie O'Sullivan, CNN ""New Day"" reporter: Conspiracy theorists, now again using no actual facts or reliable information, are linking 5G to the spread of the coronavirus.   Gupta: There are a lot of baseless conspiracy theories floating around the internet about the origins of the virus and how it spreads -- this is one of them.   A hoax started in the fringes of the internet suggested that 5G -- that's the ultra-fast wireless technology -- is responsible for the spread of the coronavirus.   Regardless of what you might think about wireless technology, there is no connection between that sort of technology and a highly transmissible virus.  Still, some celebrities shared these claims to their millions of followers on social media. In April, there were reports that people actually tried to burn down cell phone towers in the U.K. Officials were concerned that this was motivated by these conspiracy theories.  I want you to listen to how Dr. Fauci responded when asked about this in a Snapchat interview: Dr. Anthony Fauci: That's thoroughly preposterous. Untrue. And actually ridiculous. 5G doesn't impact on the immune system.  Gupta: Number six: Can I give the coronavirus to my pets? Can I get it from them?  Listener: If the virus started in animals, could they be even more susceptible to the virus than we are?  Gupta: The cat is out of the bag, so to speak, on this one. It looks like pets, especially cats and dogs, can contract Covid-19. At least two cats and a dog have tested positive in the United States. We are learning they can get it from humans, and in rare situations, pass it on to other pets.   The CDC recommends treating your pets as you would other human family members -- that means you don't let them interact with others outside the home.  Some lions and tigers at the Bronx Zoo also tested positive for the virus. The zoo says a staff member likely infected the cats.   But as things stand now, currently, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading Covid-19 in humans.   We'll keep talking about this because the bottom line is there's a lot of useful information on the internet. But some of it is wrong, and some of it can be dangerous.      We are learning more every day about the coronavirus, especially about symptoms and prevention and treatment.     I suggest you try and do what I do. Always check your sources. Be really diligent about this, and see who else can corroborate something that you might be hearing. Health professionals are always going to be a good source, but again, we are all learning together. We'll be back tomorrow. Thanks for listening."

29,CNN,"And I'm one of them.  I'm not sleeping very much these days, but the other night, I had a dream that I was painting. And I'm not really a painter. It was a large canvas with lots of reds and lots of oranges. As I was painting, I suddently realized that I was also standing on a stage with a huge audience watching over my shoulder. It made me feel very self-conscious, and when I woke up, I still felt anxious. Many blame these dreams on the unique stress and circumstances of this pandemic. It is anecdotal for now, but researchers are already hard at work trying to make sense of it all. I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent. And this is Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction. Deirdre Barrett: One of the early anxiety dreams I had as we were just getting used to this pandemic was that I dreamed that I was trying to put a hood on my cat to protect him from something toxic in the air, and the hood would make him not breathe in the toxins. And I was so scared that I wasn't going to get the hood on him in time to protect him. Gupta: That's Deirdre Barrett, a psychologist and dream researcher at Harvard University. She's currently conducting a dream survey around Covid-19 dreams. I wanted to talk to Deirdre about what's happening to our minds during this global crisis. And what we can do to manage the stress better. As a student of the brain, I've always been fascinated with dreams, so I asked Deirde: Why do we dream? Barrett: Our dreams occur predominantly, but not solely, in rapid eye movement sleep. We are replenishing certain neurotransmitters. We're fine-tuning our temperature regulation. But they're clearly serving some more psychological functions of consolidating memories, matching similar events to each other and categorizing them in our mind. And I think that dreams are just thinking in a different biochemical state. So we're thinking about all of our usual thoughts and concerns, but in this biological state that's much more visual, much more intuitive, much less logical and linear. So that's why you see dreams having these fantastic visual metaphors for things.  Erika: So I had a dream last night that I felt something weird in my mouth, and all of my front teeth were gone. So it was bloody, and it was just my gums. Gupta: Why are we experiencing this collective moment of bizarre dreams? Is there a role that anxiety is playing?  Barrett: For some people who I think feel pretty safe at home, it's just the more time to sleep and the longing for certain things that you then have kind of bizarre, fantastic, wonderful dreams about. But lots of people are having a lot of anxiety through this. Rachel: Every inch is covered in cockroaches. And like, we're talking like black specks everywhere. You could not walk without sort of cockroaches like crawling on you or flying. So I'm totally freaked out. And for some reason, we can't find anything to kill the cockroaches with, so we are taking cat litter, and we're like pouring it on the cockroaches and they're slowly dying. But it was absolutely horrifying. Barrett: In the survey I'm doing online about dreams about the pandemic, bugs are the most common one. I've seen just dozens and dozens and dozens of dreams where the dreamer is being attacked by usually large numbers of bugs, swarms of flying insects, roaches are crawling toward you, masses of wriggling worms. The average person's typical dream is an anxiety dream, either they're dreaming about getting the virus or they're dreaming some metaphor for it, like swarms of bugs attacking them.  And the health care providers are having full-on nightmares like you would see from soldiers at war. Pretty vivid images of what it's like to have somebody on a ventilator and still not able to breathe. Their visuals are much closer to what's really happening than the average person tends to go toward the metaphor.  Gupta: Do we all dream?  Barrett: Yes. The vast majority of dreams happen during rapid eye movement sleep, and we go into REM sleep every 90 minutes. And if you have someone sleep in a sleep lab for eight hours and awaken them during each REM period, you will get five dream accounts from most people. But our long-term memory is not turned on during REM sleep, so most dreams are forgotten because we don't wake up and activate the transfer into our long-term storage. Gupta: Have you ever seen anything quite like what we're seeing now in terms of this collective moment of dreams?  Barrett: No, I think this is unique for a couple of reasons. One is that any big life event, including crises, tends to stir up our dream lives. We're just thinking more intensely and emotionally by day, and dreams are just thinking in a different biochemical state. We're catching up on sleep and sleeping a little longer, and we're not setting alarms, which means that we wake up naturally out of dreams much more, whereas an alarm usually catches some other stage of sleep.  So just biologically, we're prone to having more and more vivid dreams as we catch up on sleep. So I do think this is pretty unique, even though I certainly see many of the same patterns with the 9/11 dreams I collected, or Kuwaitis right after the Iraqi occupation, or I did a study on POWs in a German prisoner of war camp in World War II and their dreams. But this, this is unique in how global it is.  Gupta: Can you talk a little bit about your work studying the dreams of 9/11 survivors? Barrett: The dreams I saw after 9/11 shared some patterns with this. The typical person who had seen it on TV, they weren't living right around the towers, they had lots and lots of anxiety dreams, where they would dream of buildings falling down or planes crashing or hijackers with knives. But usually they would also have lots of other more bizarre, fantastic stuff or things from their own lives going on in it. But the first responders after 9/11 just had full-on post-traumatic nightmares.  And then gradually, some of the people who were having bad nightmares began to spontaneously have mastery dreams, where it's kind of metaphorically solved in the dream.  There's one that was the woman who had been the air traffic controller that guided the flight that went out of Dulles Airport, had a recurring dream where she was watching her radar screen, and she could see this plane beginning to not follow its flight plan and just veer off her screen, and then it reappeared on the screen, headed toward the Pentagon.  And she was just watching this in real time, helpless, you know, trying to send signals to tell them not to do this, but realizing more and more that it was intentional. And that had been a real-life experience, and she just relived that over and over.  And finally, at some point, in just naturally recovering from the traumatic experience without intervention, she had a dream where that was happening, and she just reached into her radar screen, and she picked the little tiny plane out of the screen and just cradled it in her hand so that it couldn't do this. And she said she woke up feeling really relieved and healed and like the 9/11 experience was finally actually behind her.  Gupta: That's amazing. I mean, the way you describe that, Deirdre, sounds like it was a therapy for this particular flight controller.  Barrett: I definitely think that our dreams are thinking through, trying to help us, and sometimes just like our waking mind, they are just stuck in endless anxiety cycles and are not getting us anywhere. Although we've also taken that kind of story and we now coach people who are having recurring trauma nightmares in the idea that you can rescript your dream and think of a way that it would feel satisfying for it to end, whether it's a very literal, you know, somebody saves you or whether it's a very dreamlike metaphoric thing. Gupta: Are there ways to try and help ourselves get both better sleep and maybe more pleasant dreams?  Barrett: In general, if you're having just lots of anxiety dreams, the best technique to stop those is to think of what you would like to dream about -- like a favorite person you'd like to see or a place you'd like to visit after this is over -- and then as you're falling asleep, picture the core image for that, the person's face or the place, and just tell yourself, ""I want to dream about this,"" and enjoy the image. And that will make it both likelier that you dream about your target content, but also much less likely that you have a recurring anxiety dream. Shannon: In my dream, I'm with a bunch of friends sitting in a restaurant having a meal. We're sitting at these round wooden tables, and all of a sudden, the roof of the restaurant contracts, and we can see the open sky. And the tabletops are now connected. There's these wires coming out of them, and they become hot air balloons. And we all float away into the sky. Gupta: Do you find value in trying to record your dreams after you wake up?  Barrett: Yes, I think keeping a dream journal is a very interesting experience. You'll notice patterns in your dreams over time that you might not get just from thinking about each individual dream. So now is the ideal time, both people are recalling more and more interested in it, but we have more time to be doing things like dream journaling. So some people like to write them down in an old-fashioned pretty journal and other people just dictate them to their phone. But I'd encourage people who are noticing more dreams lately to start a dream journal.  Gupta: Just the other day, I caught my daughters having a discussion about their dreams.  My 13-year-old daughter was describing being on the beach standing in an unemployment line. When she got to the front of the line, they told her, her jobs were to keep secrets and to knit bright yellow scarves. My younger daughter said she was dreaming about being in her bedroom and seeing a lump underneath the covers on her bed. She jumped on it to attack it and woke herself up by screaming for help.  It was at once both disturbing and fascinating. I'm glad they shared the dreams with me, because sharing your dreams with people you care about is a good way to stay connected, especially as we are all keeping a physical distance.  If your dreams have gotten more bizzare lately, keep in mind, you are not alone.  And don't forget that dreams have value. And you still have control over your mind even when you sleep.  We'll be back Monday. Thanks for listening. And sweet dreams."

31,CNN,"Dr. Sanjay Gupta: We've been hearing a lot of things lately about how the pandemic is affecting our food supply chain. We have seen lines of cars, sometimes for miles, waiting at food banks. Atlanta Food Bank volunteer: You know, we're hoping that the line isn't tremendously past 2,000. We know where we're going to cut off and hopefully get everybody as much food as we possibly can. Gupta: With millions of Americans newly unemployed, more and more families are turning to soup kitchens or food pantries to get by. And then, you hear something like this: Jen Sorenson, Iowa Select Farms communications director: Our hogs have been backing up for over four weeks now. We're exhausting, you know, every plan, every resource to prevent farmers from having to euthanize our hogs so we're definitely in a terrible situation of peril right now and we're asking for help. Gupta: That was Jen Sorenson, of Iowa Select Farms, talking about the possibility of killing hogs because farmers can't maintain them anymore. The National Pork Board is estimating that 1.5 million hogs will have to be killed in the coming weeks. So what's going on here?  Well, three of the country's largest pork processing plants are closing indefinitely because of outbreaks in the workforce. Together, these plants make up about 15% of pork production.   Because of this, the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) has issued new guidelines to ensure the workers' health and safety, including setting up barriers between workers, staggering shifts and making sure everyone is working at least 6 feet apart. The country's largest meatpacking union estimates that 20 workers have died of the virus and at least 6,000 additional members have been impacted by it. Tyson's largest plant, in Waterloo, Iowa, is linked to almost half of that county's cases.  There are obviously significant health concerns. But this week, President Trump still signed an executive order, compelling meat processing plants to remain open. CNN National Correspondent Nick Watt: Meat processing plants in many states have now closed after outbreaks. Tyson, we're told, was planning to close 80% of production. The CEO says the food supply chain is breaking.   Gupta: That's a phrase I've heard a lot these days -- the supply chain is breaking -- and today I want to find out exactly what that means.  I want to know if I can still get beef and pork at my local grocery store. And why can't we just have the farmers send excess food or product directly to food banks? I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, and this is ""Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction.""  Gupta: For today's episode, I've asked National Correspondent Dianne Gallagher to share her expertise. She's been covering the food and agriculture industry for the network. And joining Dianne is Julie Niederhoff, associate professor of supply chain management at Syracuse University.   Together, they're going through the country's food supply chain, link by link, from farmers to food banks, to answer the question: Is the food supply chain breaking? And what does that mean for you?  Here's Dianne. CNN National Correspondent Dianne Gallagher: I want to cut straight to the chase here, because I think that everybody has been concerned about what they're hearing. When they hear ""food supply chain,"" they think, ""Oh, my goodness, what does this mean for me?"" So, Julie, are we running out of meat?  Syracuse Univeristy Associate Professor of Supply Chain Management Julie Niederhoff: No, not anytime real soon.   Gallagher: So we don't need to go panic buy and stock up on 40 pounds of meat in a freezer somewhere.  Niederhoff: No. Grocery stores are saying that they're not having any trouble finding meat. If it becomes a problem for them, we'll know.   Gallagher: Are we likely to see a limited variety and a changing selection of meat over the next few, however long this is going to go on?  Niederhoff: Yes, there will definitely be an impact. You know, if nothing else, we're going to see less of certain brands because we know that those particular locations are closed. And if that's the one that you really like, if that's the cut that you really like, that might be a little harder to find until they get back up online. We're down 25% in pork and 10% in beef. And that is a completely different thing than being completely out. Gallagher: I kind of want to start from the beginning. The food chain is vulnerable. The food supply chain is vulnerable, but it's, as a whole, not in crisis. But there is a segment of it that is on the brink of, if not already in crisis. And that's at the very beginning of the food chain, right, if we walk through this. We're talking about the farmers here. What is it like to be a farmer right now, especially a livestock farmer, during this pandemic? Niederhoff: It's a big risk. Farming is always a bit of a gamble. A farmer depends only on himself, and the land and the weather. And unfortunately, the way our food supply chains, our food industry has developed over time, the farmers bear the majority of the risk and get a very, very small cut of the profits. This particular issue is hurting them because if they can't sell their meat at normal market prices, that market price starts to drop. They're already getting a pretty small return per animal.  Typically you're looking at four or five, six hundred dollars to raise an animal, and you sell it for six, seven, eight hundred dollars. So you're only looking at two or three hundred dollars profit. If that price starts to drop -- and that little bit of profit that they were supposed to be getting per animal is gone. Gallagher: They're talking about potentially having to euthanize upwards of seven hundred thousand pigs a week if they can't get the supply chain straightened out. Why? Niederhoff: Right, yeah. They need a place to be. We can't overcrowd the barns. Most of the barns are heavily utilized because it's a big fixed cost. So now all of a sudden we have animals who are -- they're not moving out and more animals are potentially coming in. But even if they're not, the animals are still there. They're getting bigger. They need more space.  Gallagher: It's hard to kind of compute those images, though, of people talking about meat shortages, and then hearing about seven hundred thousand hogs a week, that may potentially have to be euthanized and not used for food, but potentially turned into fertilizer or disposed of somehow.  Niederhoff: So, yeah, I mean, unfortunately, just having someone bring a pig to the grocery store doesn't fix the problem. We need those middle stages. So we have it in one form, but we can't quite get it to the other form. And so what are you going to do?  Gallagher: If we kind of continue on this road down the food supply chain here: We have the farmers. When it leaves the farm, where does the food go from there?  Niederhoff: So pretty much all food goes from the farmers to some kind of processing. But animals have to be slaughtered and prepared to go to whatever packaging or butchering facility is going to prepare it into the cuts and styles of meat that we like.  And and milk has to go through pasteurization and homogenization processes and almost all of that processing has some level of either USDA (US Department of Agriculture) or FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) certification and testing and consumer protections, which are important. And so we can't just go from the farm to the consumers without going through those stages. Gallagher: Explain to me a little bit about why some of these plants are not, I guess, set up even to package correctly for grocery stores. Niederhoff: So I go to the store, I buy a pound of meat. It's labeled, it's packaged for that 1-pound purchase, 2-pound purchase, something like that. I buy 12 eggs. I buy a gallon of milk. And so the stuff that comes through that processing plant is going to go through the packaging or bottling or containerization process to be put into those sort of manageable sizes. They have to have specific labels on them that include very specific information.  If it's going into the food service industry, the commercial foods, so going into cafeterias and restaurants and in these big bulk purchases, what they might do is they might make a 50 pound bag of cheese, they might make a 6-gallon bag of milk. It's the same product. It's just not packaged in a sort of consumable way. Most people can't bring home a 25-pound bag of cheese and do something reasonable with that.  Gallagher: Why can't some of these large bulk packages of food just be sent off to these food pantries?  Niederhoff: Most of them, they can. So, again, it comes down a little bit to what the state-by-state laws are about how food has to be labeled. But it's been a little tricky because the regulations around labeling from the FDA and the USDA need to be followed. And so you know nobody was quite sure how to go about doing that right away.  What was allowed? And that's really the problem. If I've got milk on one side of the supply chain. Yes, it could go through, and it could then be somehow packaged and sent to the food bank. But somebody has to compensate the workers for doing that extra work. And unless we've got donors or federal dollars kind of backing that process up, there's nobody who's just going to do it for the goodwill. Gallagher: And you mentioned the workers and I want to talk about them. Why are we seeing so many outbreaks at these meat processing plants? What is it about the conditions there that make it so easy for this to spread?  Niederhoff: So we know the things that help prevent the spread of the virus, and one of them is distance from other people. And that's not something that works very well in this environment.  We're also seeing workers saying that they're not getting adequate PPE (personal protective equipment) and they're not getting some of the other support that would make it a lot safer for them.  Gallagher: We've been told by several workers that social distancing, especially on the line, on the kill line, that it's just very difficult for them to even attempt to socially distance, even once these Plexiglas dividers have been put in.  So now we're here with these outbreaks that have happened. We have these plants shutting down because of massive numbers of employees who are sick or who are calling out of work because they're afraid that they're going to get sick.  I think when you're listening to this at home, the question I'm most frequently asked is, does that mean that my meat is OK? Should I be concerned about this? Niederhoff: Scientists have said repeatedly that it's not a foodborne illness, and so there's no reason to worry that an employee who is sick is somehow going to pass that to you through the meat that you're now eating, days or weeks since it was processed. The concern is for the employee.  Gallagher: In what way could the federal government help get rid of this bottleneck that we have going on right now with the meat supply?  Niederhoff: If the federal government can find a way to help these plants open safely more quickly, by offering loans, by offering resources to get these plants open, in a way that is safe for the employees and their communities to still be able to work, then that would be an assistance to fixing the supply chain problem. If they can get access to the necessary personal protective equipment, if they can get access to whatever it is that they need to get these plants operational sooner.  Gallagher: But more than anything, it sounds like you can't open facilities unless you have a healthy and safe workforce.  Niederhoff: Yeah, no. And that's the problem right? You can't force someone to be healthy. You can't force someone to not be, not have this Covid-19. Right? So if people are sick, demanding that they open the plant is not going to fix the problem.  Gallagher: So let's talk about food banks, because I think some of the most difficult images for anybody to see are these farmers dumping milk, plowing over their crops, hearing about hogs that have to be euthanized that can't go to grocery stores or to food banks. How do food banks get their food and why can't we get the food that is there to them? Where's the breakdown in the process? Niederhoff: Yeah. So a lot of the food that comes into food banks is actually procured through the USDA. They will go in and sort of buy up leftover products from farmers and that keeps the farmers sort of protected. It provides sort of a backup market for those goods. And then those can go into these food banks. Other ways that food banks tend to get food is by grocery stores or restaurants or whoever having leftover food.  Gallagher: The state of Iowa has this new program that they're debuting starting on May 1 called Pass the Pork, which is trying to link up farmers with processors that are in operation and staying longer hours to try to get those immediately to people locally. But overall, this is not something we typically see to kind of, I guess, sustain these food banks.  Niederhoff: Yeah. We have a lot of rules and policies in place to largely to protect consumers, you know, health and safety violations and making sure regulations are consistent within a state or across state lines. But it really does create very rigid structures of how we can move things across different points in the supply chain.  Gallagher: It sounds like factory and farm and processing plant workers are the ones who really need the protection. And the concern right here. It takes so many people just to put food on the table.  Niederhoff: Right. So many people across so many states, very likely. Your chicken might have come from one state, and then processed in a different state and packaged in a different state and now shipped to you in a different state.  But every step of that way is handled and performed by people. And often they are the people who are sort of the most vulnerable within our society, the most overlooked. That's really the vulnerability we've been seeing here. It's not that the companies are going out of business, it's that the people have gotten sick, right? It's the supply chain is at risk because the people within the supply chain are vulnerable. And that's the challenge.  They deserve to be able to stay healthy and go home and keep their families healthy. And so, if we can't find a way to help them stay healthy, then we're failing them. Gallagher: And it sounds like at that point, that's when we will have serious problems with our food supply chain, that if the human aspect of it begins to fall apart, and falls apart to a greater level, that's when we're really talking about a crisis.  Gupta: These days, I know a lot of people are more worried than ever about food and how we can feed ourselves and our families.  It's important to remember that so much goes into putting food on our tables, and that every step of the way, there are people involved in making that happen. And we need to be able to take care of them.  If I've learned anything from how the nation's food supply chain works, it's that we can't leave anyone behind -- that's the only way we as a country can ever get back on our feet. We'll be back tomorrow. Thanks for listening.     "

33,CNN,"I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent. And this is ""Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction."" Sean Doyle: You can have nausea. You can sometimes develop fever, which may not be a bad response necessarily, 'cause that might indicate the immune system is mounting a response, meaning you could fight the virus in the future potentially, but you really never know what's going to happen. Gupta: That's 31-year-old Sean Doyle. He's one of a small handful of people in the United States testing a possible vaccine for Covid-19. When I spoke with Sean, he said his family and friends were nervous about his involvement with experimental medicine. But ultimately, they trusted his instincts as a medical student. And he's also had some practice. Sean was involved in a 2017 trial for an Ebola vaccine. He told me that the injection of the potential Covid vaccine into his arm was pretty mild. Doyle: It was not as bad as with other vaccines that I've gotten in the past. It really felt just like a flu shot. And after the tenderness subsided, after about a day or two, I really felt totally fine afterward. Gupta: Sean received his first dose of the vaccine in March at Emory University Hospital, where I'm also on the neurosurgery faculty.   Doyle: So since then, I've returned at the one-week mark and the two-week mark post-vaccine administration and have given some blood samples so that the investigators can both assess my health, one, and two use those blood samples to see whether or not my body and other participants' bodies were able to mount an immune response, suggesting that should our bodies see the virus in the future it could be neutralized.  Gupta: People like Sean are the only way vaccines can be proven effective for the population at large. While there are unknown risks for the early trial volunteers, it would be even riskier to skip these important testing stages. In 1976, when a new virus -- the so-called ""swine flu"" -- began spreading in New Jersey, the United States feared it could lead to a pandemic like the 1918 flu. A vaccine was rushed into development, and in less than a year nearly 25 percent of Americans had been vaccinated.  CBC broadcast (from archive): In March '76 President Gerald Ford announced the biggest immunization program in history. From the beginning the program was criticized for being hastily implemented and unnecessary. Gupta: But soon, devastating side effects began to emerge. At least 30 people died after receiving the vaccine, and about 450 more developed Guillain-Barré syndrome. That's a neurological disorder that can lead to paralysis. The program was ended, and lawsuits flooded the federal government. Now trials for a Covid-19 vaccine began less than a month after the virus' genome was first sequenced in early January.  And now scientists around the world are hard at work.   CNN Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen (on CNN's ""New Day""): From Tokyo to Quebec, from Iowa to New Orleans to Australia, scientists in a race to come up with a vaccine. More than 80 vaccine developers in all, according to the World Health Organization. So far, seven vaccines are in human trials. Gupta: At least 45 people in Atlanta and Seattle have received an injection of the vaccine, which is called mRNA-1273. Instead of using the actual virus, which could make the volunteers sick, this vaccine relies on mRNA, or messenger RNA.  Think of that as the genetic blueprint of the virus. If it works, it'll teach our body to recognize the coronavirus' spiky-looking proteins and then make antibodies to fight it. But this is a first. So far, no such vaccine has ever been approved for use on the general public. Dr. Evan Anderson is the lead investigator for the Emory University-based arm of this trial.  Dr. Evan Anderson: So with the background knowledge that existed regarding the importance of the spike protein for both MERS and for SARS, this really allowed for the vaccine to be developed in fairly short order given its similarity to those other coronaviruses, really cutting years of time off of the development process. So this is really technology that, if it is successful in this trial or other trials, could expedite other vaccines in the future. Gupta: But that's the future. Even if things continue at such a fast pace, it could be a year or even more before a vaccine for Covid-19 is widely available.   Microsoft founder Bill Gates is funding seven efforts to find a safe and effective vaccine. He told CNN this weekend that his best-case scenario would be for large-scale manufacturing to begin within a year -- but only if everything goes perfectly. Bill Gates: There's over 100 efforts. What we need to do is pick the most promising of those, get money, sort of going full speed, build the manufacturing in parallel, some of which is shared like the fill-finish, which is the last step, where there's nowhere near the capacity for the 7 billion doses, so we need to do that.   Gupta: Vaccine development usually happens in three phases: Phase one looks at whether the vaccine is safe for a few people. Phase two looks at whether it's safe for more people and tests various dosage amounts to see if it's effective. Phase three gathers data on whether the vaccine really protects people in real-life situations.  Some scientists want to speed up this process even further with what's called a ""human-challenge trial."" That would purposefully expose people to Covid-19 to test the efficacy of a vaccine. That raises ethical questions as well. And because of the risks, there aren't any challenge trials underway right now.  The vaccine Sean Doyle is helping test out is currently in phase one. Here's lead investigator Dr. Evan Anderson again.  Anderson: The exact timing of when this vaccine might make it through the phase two and phase three trials remains a bit uncertain at this point in time. It would be most likely that it wouldn't be until sometime in 2021 should this vaccine be successful. If this vaccine does fail, then the timeline gets shifted backwards to some of the candidates that are just now arriving in clinical trials. Gupta: But the government could direct manufacturers to begin producing a vaccine before it has gone through all three phases and has been fully tested.  At a briefing last month, White House coronavirus task force member Dr. Anthony Fauci explained why he's willing to take this risk.  Dr. Anthony Fauci: One of the things that we are going to do that you need to understand -- that has been a stumbling block for previous development of vaccines -- and that is, even before you know something works, at risk, you have to start producing it.  Because once you know it works, you can't say, ""Great, it works. Now give me another six months to produce it."" Gupta: Dr. Fauci said they didn't take that risk with the mosquito-borne Zika virus when it threatened the United States in 2016. By the time human trials for a vaccine showed promise, the cases had dissipated. There is still no vaccine available.   So efforts to find a vaccine for Covid-19 are moving much faster, but Dr. Fauci said they're doing so safely.   Fauci: The worst possible thing you could do is vaccinate somebody to prevent infection and actually make them worse. Gupta: We don't want to repeat the same mistakes made in 1976 when the government rushed to get the flu vaccine without proper testing. And that's why people like Sean Doyle are so important. The trial that he's volunteering for may get us closer to a safe and effective vaccine. ... Nurse: We have you on the 23rd at 8 a.m.  Doyle: Is that two weeks from today?  Nurse: Yeah. Is that still good? Doyle: Yes. ... Gupta: That's Sean at his checkup. Over the next year, he'll be monitored to make sure the vaccine doesn't cause any harmful side effects.  Scientists hope that Sean's blood, and that of other volunteers, holds the key to unlocking a Covid-19 weapon for the rest of us. Meanwhile, scientists overseas are equally hopeful. Adrian Hill: We've been given permission by regulators to proceed really at quite a rapid rate.  Gupta: That's Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford in England. The institute has already begun ambitious, large-scale human trials of its own potential vaccine. If all goes well, researchers say they could have a million doses ready by September. Hill: So over the next couple of weeks, we'll probably enroll as many as 1,000 people into this trial. Partly because we've used this type of vaccine before for other indications, and partly because we believe the safety profile should be very good. Gupta: In our race to a vaccine, we are walking a tightrope between safety and speed, and only time will tell how well we've struck that balance. It's important to sprint, as long as you don't trip and fall.  We'll be back tomorrow. Thanks for listening."

36,CNN,"Gupta: Georgia is one of several states that are reopening in some form this week. But there's been a lot of debate surrounding those decisions.  And while many Georgia businesses reopen following rules of a new normal, there are still plenty of questions.  Shannon Stafford: We looked at the state board guidelines and tried to implement as many of those things that was possible. Gupta: Some, like hair salon owner Shannon Stafford have cautiously decided to open their doors.  Stafford: But it's going to be difficult because we're so hands on. So that's why it's gonna be kind of vital to making sure that we both wear masks. Hands are being cleaned. We have fresh garments. We have to put things like that in place because eventually we're going to all be able to reopen, this is happening. Gupta: While others like chef Ian Winslade still feel like it's too soon.  Winslade: There's a lot of things there that we can't get ahold of right now. Face masks are a big problem. Finding sanitizer is a big problem. And so we'd have to address all of those things before we can even consider reopening. Gupta: There's a lot for business owners to consider when thinking about reopening -- can you limit the number of customers? Make sure everyone is keeping a safe distance? Do you make everyone wear a mask? Not to mention, how will each decision ultimately affect your bottom line?  Joining me today to help address some of these concerns is Dr. Carlos del Rio.  Dr. Del Rio is an infectious disease expert and a professor of medicine and global health at Emory University, where I am also on staff. His life's work is in HIV research, but he's now doing work on Covid-19 treatments and a vaccine.  Gupta: Politics aside, Carlos, are we ready to reopen? Del Rio: You know, I don't think so, but I would say, Sanjay, that, you know, from a health standpoint, it's always too soon. From a business standpoint, it's always too late. It's always such a hard decision. And what I think we need to do is find a place that we can have some business, some economic development at the same time that we are doing it in a safe public health way. And the problem is, we don't know the answer to that. Because we've never experienced this before.  Gupta: I'd like to send a couple of questions from these business owners to you, and I'll preface by saying that everyone's situation is going to be a little different, how they approach this is going to be different, how people assess risk is gonna be different. But I think there was a common sense that there's a lot of information out there, but maybe not enough clarity on what people should do.  So this is a question from Alex Brounstein, he's the owner of Grindhouse Killer Burgers in Atlanta. And he had this question: Brounstein: Right now, I mean, six feet seems to be the standard. But, you know, if your tables are six feet away, sometimes somebody walks by, that's inside of six feet or your server has to come to your table. I mean, how do you, you know, logistically make all this work? I don't know.  Del Rio: So a couple of things. Unless you have somebody who's a hyper spreader, a super spreader, walking by, somebody being close to somebody, for just a few seconds may not transmit this. Maybe it's very different if you're sitting at the table. You know, you and I have talked a lot about this article from China with the three tables. People were sitting there. They didn't talk anything about the waiters or the cooks. It was people sitting at the table that got infected. Right. The people that were there for a long period of time. So I think that's one thing to think about.  Gupta: Just to clarify for our listeners, Dr. Del Rio is referring to a study that recently came out of China.  In that study, they looked at how the virus had spread within a restaurant.  There was one infected person who wasn't showing symptoms at the time, and what they found is that this one person seemed to have spread the virus to nine others. Both at the person's table and surrounding tables.  It shows that the real risk there is that you're exposed for a prolonged period of time, such as when you're sitting and eating. Del Rio: The other thing is I think that I think we have grossly underestimated how much of this transmission is by fomites, by things you touch. So how do you make sure that when people walk in, they don't need to open the door? The door is open. And what policies do we have in place from a human resource standpoint that that that makes it easy for a waiter if they're not feeling well to not come to work? Because if they said, no, I've got to go to work because otherwise I'm not going to get paid, well, that person is going to come to work and potentially can start a transmission. So we really have to change a lot of things, including HR policies, it's not just where we put our tables.  Gupta: Let me send you a question from Savannah, Georgia, now. We talked to David, who owns a nail salon there in Savannah. And he said that because the number of cases in Chatham County where the city of Savannah is located is really low, he feels that the risk to open is pretty small. And I think that that's something that people are wondering. Is it true that it's safer to reopen in places with fewer cases?  Del Rio: Do we know truly that there's fewer cases? I mean, do we have good data? And I agree. I mean, I think that opening a place in New York City may be very different than opening a place in Iowa. I think decisions here have to be local. It's gonna be very different depending where you are. And that's why making a national decision is difficult. A state decision is difficult. You have to follow the data.  Gupta: Let me ask you this question from Michael Michaelides, who owns CrossFit Downtown Atlanta.  Michaelides: What are the things that that are here to stay and that we should already be preparing for? And what are the things that are just temporary? And if they are temporary, how do we know when that's over? Del Rio: Again, I think until we have a vaccine or until this somehow magically goes away, I mean, I would think a gym will will need to reformat how they are positioned and the hours of operation and what they do and maybe what they allowed to happen. And I'll give you an example. I've been thinking about the gym that I go to. The running machines are too close to each other. And, you know, somebody could be right next to you and sweating and you're you're not six feet apart from the other person. And then you're grabbing the the handle. And there's like I think there's two places to get hand sanitizer in the entire place. That needs to be a lot more. So maybe gyms can have certain hours that are just for people over 65 right? So you try to spread out your clients a lot more. Which of course would be something that many of us may say, well, that's not convenient with the hours I would like to go, but I think convenience is something we're gonna have to sacrifice in order to keep our health.  Gupta: I think that's such a critical point. I mean, we are all in this together. People have heard that phrase over and over again, but that's what it means, is that even if you don't get sick, you could still spread this virus to your family, to your community, to the people you love. And it's not just about you at this point, given that we're dealing with a contagious virus.  Gupta: Obviously, what's happening in Georgia is something that the country, perhaps the world is really paying attention to. Are there going to be lessons that come out of Georgia? Del Rio: Yeah I mean I think I think there will be. I think either, you know, people are going to say the governor made the right decision or people going to say the governor made the wrong decision. I also think there are important lessons about how the population responds to this decision. I mean, CDC is here in Georgia. I mean, I just I just hope that there is a more coordinated response. I can tell you that I know a lot of the business leaders and a lot of other people are concerned and are trying to do whatever they can to try to be effective. It's almost feels like, you know, like we're trying to to prevent this boat from sinking because we're all on it, right? I mean, I live in Georgia. So the reality is this is this is personal. And that's why I tell people, you know, I, I'm not going out. I'm wearing my mask. I'm not going to restaurants and I'm continue practicing social distancing and I'm continuing doing it because I care for my health. Gupta: Just because you can go out doesn't mean you have to go out.  Del Rio: That's exactly right. I mean, nobody has been knocking on my door saying, hey, you need to go bowling, right? Gupta: (laughs) Right. They're certainly not knocking on your door knowing all the work that you're doing in this area. I hope to see you in person sometime soon, but until then, we'll see each other on the screen like this. So thank you very much.  Del Rio: Sounds good. Take care. Gupta: Okay thank you. We're all still in uncharted territory here -- and because of the way the virus behaves -- it could take weeks before we see the impact reopening has on communities. That is why we need the data to lead the way. This is going to be a long tunnel, but I do think there is a light at the end of it. If we all do our part, hopefully we'll move closer to the end sooner rather than later.

38,CNN,"Trump blasted the media for (correctly) reporting that he had spoken to and asked questions of Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, at the Thursday coronavirus briefing during which he wondered aloud whether UV rays and disinfectant injections could be used as treatments for the virus. ""Was just informed that the Fake News from the Thursday White House Press Conference had me speaking & asking questions of Dr. Deborah Birx. Wrong, I was speaking to our Laboratory expert, not Deborah, about sunlight etc. & the CoronaVirus. The Lamestream Media is corrupt & sick!"" he wrote on Twitter.  Facts First: Trump did speak to and ask questions of Birx. In fact, he addressed her by name, ""Deborah,"" when he asked a question about the use of light (and heat) to treat the virus. Here's how the official White House transcript records that exchange: ""THE PRESIDENT: Deborah, have you ever heard of that? The heat and the light, relative to certain viruses, yes, but relative to this virus? DR. BIRX: Not as a treatment. I mean, certainly fever — THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. DR. BIRX: — is a good thing. When you have a fever, it helps your body respond. But not as — I've not seen heat or (inaudible). THE PRESIDENT: I think it's a great thing to look at. I mean, you know. Okay?"" Trump might perhaps have meant that he was addressing Department of Homeland Security science official Bill Bryan, not Birx, during the section of the briefing when he spoke specifically about the possible use of disinfectant. (At that other moment, he was looking in the direction of both Bryan and Birx at the side of the room.) But that's not what he said in the tweet. When he has left the White House  Defending his work habits after a New York Times article last week painted him as late-arriving and television-obsessed, Trump tweeted: ""I work from early in the morning until late at night, haven't left the White House in many months (except to launch Hospital Ship Comfort) in order to take care of Trade Deals, Military Rebuilding etc..."" Facts First: It's not true that Trump hasn't left the White House in ""many months"" other than his March 28 trip to Virginia to see off the Comfort hospital ship. He left multiple times just last month. Trump held a campaign rally in North Carolina on March 2. He went to Pennsylvania on March 5 for a Fox News town hall. On March 6, he visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in Atlanta and toured tornado damage in Tennessee. He then spent the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago club and residence in Florida, flying to Orlando for a private fundraiser on March 9. He visited the Federal Emergency Management Agency headquarters in Washington on March 19. In February, Trump held five rallies, played golf and made a trip to India, among other travels outside the White House.  A laughable claim of ""sarcasm"" Over three tweets, Trump repeated his familiar complaint about how reporters were awarded the Pulitzer Prize for their coverage of the Trump-Russia story -- except, instead of the Pulitzer, Trump four times used the word ""Noble,"" apparently misspelling ""Nobel."" After he was roundly mocked for both the spelling error and the prize mix-up, Trump deleted the tweets. But he also offered a ridiculous explanation: he had intentionally used ""Noble,"" as ""sarcasm."" ""Does anybody get the meaning of what a so-called Noble (not Nobel) Prize is, especially as it pertains to Reporters and Journalists? Noble is defined as, 'having or showing fine personal qualities or high moral principles and ideals.' Does sarcasm ever work?"" Facts First: Like his Friday lie that he was being ""sarcastic"" when he mused about people injecting disinfectant, this is obvious nonsense. There was no indication he was being sarcastic in the tweets about the ""Noble."" Here is what the three now-deleted tweets said: ""When will all of the 'reporters' who have received Noble Prizes for their work on Russia, Russia, Russia, only to have been proven totally wrong (and, in fact, it was the other side who committed the crimes), be turning back their cherished 'Nobles' so that they can be given...to the REAL REPORTERS & JOURNALISTS who got it right. I can give the Committee a very comprehensive list. When will the Noble Committee DEMAND the Prizes back, especially since they were gotten under fraud? The reporters and Lamestream Media knew the truth all along ...Lawsuits should be brought against all, including the Fake News Organizations, to rectify this terrible injustice. For all of the great lawyers out there, do we have any takers? When will the Noble Committee Act? Better be fast!"" A baseless conspiracy theory Trump retweeted a baseless coronavirus conspiracy theory from pro-Trump pundit John Cardillo. Cardillo alleged that people had tried to oust Trump through illegitimate means before the pandemic, then added: ""Do you really think these lunatics wouldn't inflate the mortality rates by underreporting the infection rates in an attempt to steal the election?"" Facts First: There is no basis for the suggestion that Trump opponents are inflating the coronavirus mortality rate to try to ""steal the election."" While the precise mortality rate is challenging to identify, there is no evidence that health authorities are manipulating any figures to damage the President. Further, Trump opponents and independent experts have consistently called for a dramatic expansion of coronavirus testing -- which would likely result in a lower, not higher, ratio of people dying to people known to be infected. There is subjectivity involved in official death totals. Official counts in New York and some other states now include ""probable"" deaths of people who had not been tested but whose deaths were thought likely by doctors, coroners or medical examiners to have been from the virus. But even with the addition of ""probable"" deaths, there is a broad expert consensus that the official figures are undercounting, not overcounting, the true number of deaths. Trump critics have been vocal in their calls for more people to be tested. Testing people with milder symptoms or no symptoms would reduce, not inflate, the ratio of people dying to the total infected population."

40,CNN,"In fact, while attempting to spin this, the President even said to a reporter that surely the reporter understood he was being sarcastic because the President had said it right to him. And the reporter told the President he had not been there at the time. ""Some doctors felt they needed to clarify that, after you ..."" the reporter said.  ""Well, of course, all they had to do was hear -- just you don't know the way it was asked. I was looking at you,"" Trump said. ""No sir. I wasn't there yesterday,"" the reporter said. We're running out of words to describe this era. Republicans in Congress and in the Trump administration know that not only is the President failing to rise to this moment to, for example, get the nation on a path to wide spread testing, the President's now making open ponderings about treatments that experts worry could actually harm people. His a-scientific, anti-scientific musings have been dangerous. We saw this with his weeks of downplaying the virus. Two months ago today, the President said he'd done a good job since the US had only 15 cases which would soon go down to almost zero. Then the President was pushing the use of hydroxychloroquine. ""What have you got to lose,"" he said. Well, the FDA on Friday issued a caution against the use of that drug outside a hospital or a clinical trial due to the risk of heart rhythm problems. Republican leaders need to acknowledge the reality of the situation. They need to intervene. They need to convince President Trump to defer to the experts and focus on the needs of not his ego but the sick and the dying and the people trying to care for them. There is going to be a history of this era written and those who are pretending this irresponsibility is not happening, they will be remembered as villains."
41,CNN,"Many of them constantly try to contain his worst instincts, abandoning alleged principles in the process. They contort themselves to play court politics, playing up to the President's family to shore up support. Their careers are hostage to his ego as they engage in absurd flattery, afraid that speaking the truth bluntly in public will cause them to lose their jobs -- after all, it's happened to some of their predecessors.  One of them, former acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney — a one-time fiscal conservative who as director of the Office of Management and Budget presided over a massive explosion in spending, deficit and debt before the pandemic — showed that even ornate rationalizations of irrational behavior cannot save you.  In his new book ""Front Row at the Trump Show,"" ABC News White House correspondent Jonathan Karl describes one instance in which Mulvaney reportedly recommended that his staff read a book called ""A First-Rate Madness: Uncovering the Links Between Leadership and Mental Illness,"" by Dr. Nassir Ghaemi, the director of the mood disorders program at Tufts Medical Center.  ""The new acting chief of staff seemed to be saying President Trump was mentally ill — and that this was a good thing,"" Karl recounts. ""The corollary to that theory: Don't try to control the man in the Oval Office. What you think is madness is actually genius.""   Apparently those closest to the President are trying to spin his alarming habits of mind as a positive good in order to navigate the daily strain of life in the Trump White House. They are spinning themselves.  This is why so much of the cleanup for the President's disinfectant remarks Thursday has abandoned anything resembling honesty. They're doing the best with what they've got to work with. So the new White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, defaulted to blaming the media for reporting the President's comments, saying they lacked context.  The President himself then told reporters he was being sarcastic, which in this administration has become shorthand for something so terrible caught on tape that you have to pretend it was a joke.  For the record, here's the full transcript of his remarks, courtesy of CNN's Daniel Dale.  The real problem is that words matter, especially when you're president. Perhaps that's why Google Trends showed a massive worldwide spike of searches for ""inject with disinfectant."" Press briefings aren't insult comedy stand-up or free association time — especially during a pandemic.  Indeed, there's a lot of controversy about whether the press should even cover the President's five o'clock follies — the daily pandemic press briefings that he uses as public ego stroking sessions in the absence of campaign rallies. But they do offer occasional scientific and medical insight from people like Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus task force coordinator.  President Trump's rambling digressions into misinformation also offers insight of a negative kind — real-time insights into his own disorganized mind. They reveal a person who is desperate for attention but determined to avoid responsibility, someone who kicks back at facts and anything resembling accountability. That's why we need Birx and Fauci to firmly push back on his most irresponsible ideas in public. Their credibility is essential to American's faith in our government's response. Sadly, Donald Trump is not. The people being fooled are the President's self-described ""strong supporters"" — roughly one-third of Americans in the latest Washington Post/ABC News poll. They've been suckered into believing that Trump is far more capable and caring about people like them than he is. But as the President's team desperately tries to make Joe Biden's mental acuity a campaign issue, they're doing it with damaged goods that are on display nearly every day at dinnertime.   President Trump's comments about disinfectant are an indelible example of how unhinged and irresponsible he can be: What he said is something that everyone can understand. And people planning to pull the lever for the President will go to the polls knowing that he suggested that injecting disinfectant might potentially combat Covid-19 — when it would actually kill people. "
42,CNN,"It's been a journey for Chris, no doubt. And we've been discussing that journey a lot on his show and on our own.  Like a lot of people, I was worried about him, even giving him some advice -- as a doctor and a friend.  Cuomo (from Cuomo Prime Time): Dr. Sanjay Gupta, our chief, is back. My brother, a North Star for many of us during this time. You were right when you told me that I would see a different side of this once the virus took root. Dr. Gupta: Chris, I mean look, I know you're a warrior, but you're allowed to take a day off. You know we love you. We think about you, and it's OK to take a day off. Cuomo: You're totally right. You've got to take care of yourself first. You can't take care of anybody else. Dr. Gupta: Since his initial diagnosis, Chris' wife, Cristina, and son Mario have also been diagnosed with Covid-19.  Now that he's through the worst of it, I wanted to catch up and ask him about his experience with the virus. And also find out how he and his family are now doing.   I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent. And this is ""Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction.""  Dr. Gupta: Let me ask you about you. What are your days like nowadays? You know, tell me everything. When are you waking up? What are you doing? How do you spend your time? Cuomo: Well, it's changing. This has been a transformative event for me. I've never been knocked on my ass like this before. I've had Lyme disease. I was diagnosed with PTSD. They put me on that pediatric dose of Celexa, you know, and I had to work through why I was having these dreams and all that stuff, but nothing like this. You know, a shivering mess for days where I was forced to be isolated and take stock in a way that I never had in my adult life.  So I went from doing nothing all day except preparing to do that one hour of television, after which I would be a sweaty mess and fall down on the couch and basically lay there for like six hours and then get into some weird sleep cycle. Now, I am in the recovery phase, which I didn't know existed. And I am trying to be highly structured, so I wake up early. I write and I read. Then I'm trying to start upping my activity curve. I can do very little exercise. If I do too much, I heat up.  And I start to get a wave of almost like kind of a mild nausea And now that I'm, um -- now that I don't have to be isolated. I'm waking the kids up in the morning for school, doing breakfast. Cristina is -- needs to sleep. It hits her hard at night. Her symptoms. She gets really bad sinus pressure at night and there are no great answers. And I am still warm. And they say I may be for weeks. But, I have a little bit more energy. I feel about 48% myself. Dr. Gupta: I can see you, obviously, the people who are listening to this podcast cannot, but you look you look a lot better. I mean, we we talk a lot. I see you a lot. You know, obviously just via screen like this. But you do look better. One thing I do want to say is that when we first talked about this, about you having a positive result on that on that test, I got to tell you, I was I was worried. And these aren't things that I told you while you were still dealing with this because I was modulating myself, even. So, the conversation I'm having with you now is a different conversation.  Because I'd been reading stories about young people who had really no preexisting illness or anything and them getting really sick, Chris, and even dying. Now, am I going to share that with you on television? You know, as you're dealing with this. No, I'm not. Now, I don't think that that's not being honest. I think it's, it's modulating how I present things a little bit. But I got to tell you, I was I was worried about you. And there were times when you had these declines and your and your nights were terrible and your pulse oximetry, your oxygenation was a little lower than I would have, you know, liked. And I knew that you couldn't necessarily get to the hospital right away. So I was worried. And I I guess the question is, were you? Did you ever think that this was going to really go sideways on you?  Cuomo: You know, there's so much of an unknown. Right? And what you keep relying on is perspective, that it's not supposed to be me. It's not supposed to be me. I was having those funky dreams that a lot of people have and I take a lot of comfort in the new Covid community that I got patched into through this. Of people -- it's so comforting, Sanjay, when somebody has had the same s**t that you have. Dr. Gupta: Right.  Cuomo: You know what I mean? The commiseration thing is real, you know? Yeah. You got those crazy shakes? You bruise your leg yet, you know, banging your legs into each other? Yeah, I got that bruise. So then I go outside into the cold air. And because when you're sweating, man, there's nothing that feels as comforting as that. Now, the problem is you can only stay there for a couple of minutes because you're gonna start to shake. That was the worst. And then I got through it. Beautiful.  So that was my journey.  Dr. Gupta: And that is most people. I mean, I think it is worth reminding people in all of this that most people do recover. We're defining recovery still. But they do recover. They get out of the hospital. They obviously survive even if they're elderly, even if they have preexisting conditions. Why -- why didn't you just take some time off? Did you even take a day off? I can't remember. You hosted your show just about every night. Cuomo: I take off every day, Sanjay! I do, like, nothing all day long until, like, this week. I would just be preparing for one hour of television. The rest of the day, I would -- I'm laying down or doing breathing exercises or walking around my back yard. It is maddening how little I do. I've never been this sedentary in my life.  Dr. Gupta: You're wearing a hat right now that says ""truth."" And I have to say, I think it's a really -- I think it's a good hat for you because truth is always important. And I've been struck during this this particular story, and I will still call it a story or an episode, because I think it does have an end date at some point. But for this story, I think truth is particularly important because people don't always know who to trust right now. And when it comes to science and data and evidence, I feel like, as a medical reporter, I've had a luxury because I can always pivot to the data and the science and everything. And yet here with this story, sometimes even that has come under assault.  Cuomo: I think that this is an awakening for the society, that government is not just something to disrespect and write off as a function of partisan politics. Partisan politics is too much a part of the equation, of course, but this is a reminder of, ""The institutions have to work."" Dr. Gupta: I don't want to talk about the politics too much. I do want to just say this one point and that is that I don't think of myself as someone who necessarily shies away from politics, because I think sometimes it is part of the discussion, especially when you're talking about a big issue like this that requires governmental response. My concern sometimes is that it gets in the way. I -- there's real data to share. There's real trajectories to look at, to help educate people. And sometimes it does become a conversation about who did what wrong, when? All that sort of stuff. And I sometimes I just don't find it that helpful. But let me ask you this. Did this make you more interested in public service or politics? I mean, it is in your family's blood, obviously, your father, your brother. This episode now, has it changed how you feel about it?  Cuomo: Here's what I would say, it definitely changed me in very significant ways. I was put into a position to think about things that I'd never thought about before. What matters to me. The reason that I thought you made the right move, not accepting Surgeon General. That is such a huge accolade. It is such a big deal because of your ability to connect with people and understand science. You are unique that way. But you didn't. And the reason it was the right move is because once you're in the game, you must play the game. I don't want to be any more subjected to the game than I am right now, and I think the mitigation effect of what you can get done versus what we can expose and push others to do militates in favor of staying out, for me personally. And I see you contextually that way, also. You would not have the reach that you have to discuss medical marijuana, Covid. You have more influence on the national dialog this way than you would if you were surgeon general.  It's not for me. It has made me think more acutely about what my purpose is within journalism. Dr. Gupta: You know, it's interesting, Chris, is that you and I do talk on the phone a lot outside of the program and you're always asking questions. And it's worth pointing out to the audience that this issue of testing has come up a lot. But you were one of the first. I still remember this this call. You were one of the first to really, I think, highlight it from a inadequacy standpoint. We were focused on how does a test work, false, positive, false, negative rate, sensitivity, specificity, all those things we look at from a scientific perspective. But I think you widen the aperture quite a bit on this and said, ""Hey, wait, is there a more systemic problem here?"" And I think that does speak to your your wealth of contacts and your and your constant reading and things like that.  And then I had a conversation with your brother about your mother, Matilda. And your brother passed Matilda's Law named for her obviously restricting movements and visits for New Yorkers over 70 years old. Same time you're doing that, that meant it would it would be hard for you to see her as well.  Cuomo: Yeah, that's why he passed it. It was a power move, Sanjay. Cheap, cheap, sneaky. No, look. He was right to do it. He and frankly, Dr. Anthony Fauci, who's a longtime family friend. And they were both right. I was being hyper sentimental and protective of my mom. I want to keep her with me. I was always going to be exposed to this virus. There was no chance I wasn't going to be. I was sneaking around in too many hospitals. I'm trying to get a sense of where the PPE was going. How was it we kept having this disconnect and I wanted to see for myself what the burden was, so that people wouldn't be able to fake the funk with numbers about the reality for the workers. I was always gonna get exposed. It was just a matter of when. And again, I get sick pretty easy. You know, I'm not an iron man, you know? So they were right to move mom. Andrew was right to see the particular vulnerabilities of the elderly. We do live in fear of my mother getting sick. Why? Because they don't do well. That's why.  Dr. Gupta: Well, I was really glad that that he did. And I'm glad that you talked about it, because my parents who live in Florida, they live in a community. And I was on the phone with them every day. How are you doing? You know, just just not even just physically, but psychologically. You know, you. I'm worried about this. You must be very worried about this. And I'm glad that that you that your brother did this and that you talked about it, because I think it was missing part of the story that the legislation was important. But I think the discussing of it was it was really important as well.  Cuomo: Yeah. You know, there is a sensitivity. There is a balance. There's a vulnerability.  But I made a decision with this that I'm not going to tell people that we've got to be in it together and that you got to have transparency, and then get sick and go hide. I personally was like, listen, you know, you're trying to give people insight into what this is about and what it isn't. Now you're living it, live it.  This is this is circumstantial for me. I'm not supposed to be the story. I don't want to be the story. But this was unique because it's not like I just got the flu. It's like we really don't understand this. So I took the risk but I'm OK with the tradeoff because I know for a fact that it exposed me to people who were able to help me understand what I was dealing with and what was to come in a way that I wouldn't have been able to otherwise. So personally, it's been beneficial. And I know that it has been helpful to a lot of people. That they knew, ""Okay, so if I get this, I'm going to look like him. All right. I got it. That demystifies it. And hey, I'm dealing with the same thing he is. I'm going to try those exercises. You know? I'm going to try that. I'm going to see how that is. Oh, he's having those funky dreams, too, right? Oh, so he's doing compresses. You know, I never been thought of. I guess I do that with my kids. Let me try it."" And that means a lot to me.  Dr. Gupta: Part of the reason that we talked about this on television every night is because we're dealing with a new virus here. Nobody has the answers. So to hear firsthand from someone who's dealing with this, every detail matters to two clinicians who are trying to better understand this virus. We're all learning, but also the psychological part of it.   Cuomo: That's the important piece! Mental health is a nightmare for us. Stigma. People don't want to talk about it. And I know, personally, that this definitely affected my head. And I'm telling you, this has put me in a funk. I'm not just sad, I'm not just down, but you start to get a withering resolve: I'll never be myself again. I'll never be 100 percent again, I'll never be what I was. Every day I'm going to wake up hot. Every day it's the same. Any change is incremental. I can't do what I want to do. I can't be who I want to be. And it cycles. And that is not feelings. That is not sadness. That is emotional illness, mental illness, and you have to deal with it. You've got to get therapy. I get therapy every two weeks. Now I'm doing it twice a week. Why? Got to talk to somebody who can process this s**t for me. Dr. Gupta: Let me ask you this. So how is Mario doing?  Cuomo: Mario has got the same stuff Cristina has. Sinus pressure worse at night. No sense of taste and smell. Interesting parental point. Very different when a kid can't taste and smell versus an adult. Very disorienting to a kid. And they start to exhibit weird behaviors. My son is 14 and he is now trying to eat stuff that he shouldn't because he is so fascinated with his inability to taste. And it's also scary to a kid in the way that it isn't to an adult. But, like his mom, every day they're better. That he's sick, happens. The virus goes through families. Nothing unique. No woe is Cuomo. Everybody's going through this. We're no different. And if anything, we're on the lucky side.  Dr. Gupta: As Chris has said countless times, he and his family are lucky, but his first-hand accounts of the virus and the harrowing symptoms, reflects what is happening to so many around the world.   That is why it was so valuable to hear his insights and his personal experiences. We are all learning about this together.  We do know that the virus is dangerously contagious, so we must do everything we can to protect ourselves, our loved ones, our healthcare workers, everyone in our community. The one thing we can all do to help out for now is to stay home and practice physical distancing.

44,CNN,"Say it with me: The coronavirus isn't like other viruses. It's totally new to humans, meaning we have a) no herd immunity b) no effective treatment (yet) and c) no vaccine. 3. ""We've never closed down the United States. We've never closed down Nevada. We've never closed down Las Vegas because that's our job."" [clears throat] We've never had a virus like this one. Or at least: We haven't had a virus like this one for more than 100 years. 4. ""Entertainment capital of the world where everything is clean."" Wait. Are we talking about Las Vegas still? 5. ""I've lived a long life. I grew up in the heart of Manhattan. I knew what it's like to be with subways and crammed into elevators."" This argument, which Goodman isn't alone in making, literally makes no sense. The notion that because we all have lived in crowded areas and therefore don't need to worry about coronavirus, misses, um, a few key points. And yes, I am going to say them again. We have no herd immunity to Covid-19. We have no effective treatment. We have no vaccine.  And let me add to that: Coronavirus has already killed more than 46,000 Americans. In short: Circumstances have changed, Mayor, since you were crammed into an elevator at some point in your life. 6. ""That's up to them to figure out. I don't run a casino."" Asked how she would maintain social distancing if casinos were open, this was Goodman's response. Sort of a hands-off approach! 7. ""I'm not a private owner of a hotel. I wish I were. And I would have the cleanest hotel with six feet figured out for every human being that comes in there."" Honestly, same. 8. ""You're very good, Anderson. I've watched you for years."" He is! Great interviewer! And making guys with glasses cool again! 9. ""We don't do bad things to people at all ever."" I feel like this is a sentiment we all can get behind. 10. ""Maybe it's breathing. I'm sorry. Being silly here."" Goodman thought Anderson was interrupting her. (He wasn't.) It was the old ""breathing"" thing. Gets you every time on TV. That's why I hold my breath when I am on. 11. ""Well, first of all, as someone who's pretty sure she possibly had in January, I have already been into the hospitals to say they take my plasma."" BREAKING NEWS: The mayor of Las Vegas was the first person in America to have coronavirus! A month before the previously first-known case! Wait, what's that I'm being told in my ear ... she's just saying this with no proof ... oh, OK guys, take down the breaking news banner. Sorry.  12. ""I don't have that. I don't have that. Well, no, that's for our scientists. And the whole thing is fact."" The mayor of Las Vegas on contact tracing: ""The whole thing is fact."" 13. ""We're not getting the truth. I know over the years, going back to the 1950s, with the atomic bomb, don't worry about more testing in Nevada. You'll all be fine. Take a shower."" Just to be clear here: Goodman is comparing the advice from medical professionals on coronavirus to false medical claims that nuclear testing was not harmful to those within range of it. What's amazing is that this isn't the wildest thing she said in the interview! 14. ""No, this isn't China. This is Las Vegas, Nevada."" The idea that the coronavirus spreads differently in China versus Las Vegas is, uh, both deeply misguided and a very dangerous thing for a public official to say. 15. ""We've had Ebola. We've had the West Nile. We've had polio."" There was Ebola in Las Vegas? Man, I am *not* paying close enough attention to the news! 16. ""And anybody who was in or comes into the office that needs an appointment or has an issue, they all are with their masks on or we always enforce social distancing and the office is absolutely pristine with germs."" I know what she means. But ""pristine with germs"" is not the preferred way to say ""clean."" 17. ""You're talking disease. I'm talking life. I'm talking life and living."" [checks notes] Coronavirus has killed more than 46,000 Americans -- including 187 in Nevada. 18. ""It is not about anything other than putting those who have lost their jobs in a city that wasn't broken, and didn't have disease, back to work."" So, Goodman is claiming that no one in Las Vegas had coronavirus when the governor made the decision to issue a stay-at-home order? What proof does she have of that? Oh, none. 19. ""We offered to be a controlled group."" It appears as though Goodman is offering up Las Vegas as a petri dish to see what happens when you open a major American city back up amid a pandemic. I'm not sure she has cleared this with the actual people who live in the city, but ... 20. ""First of all, I don't gamble. I used to gamble. ... I don't have the time."" Yeah, this feels like a good place to end."
45,CNN,"No season openers, no championships. No fans in stadiums.   Sports reporters, like rugby commentator Nick Heath, have had to get creative.  Rugby commentator Nick Heath (on Twitter): In the meantime, you join me live at sunny Tooting Commons as Mike O'Connell looks to put in another impressive showing here in the Daily Dodge. Classic approach to leave the house in gym kit, looking like he's exercising, but he's not fooling wife Deborah when he comes back, having not broken a sweat ...  Dr. Gupta: After the NBA suspended its season, most major sports organizations in the US followed suit. And it's not just athletes and team employees left to wonder what's next -- it's also meant unemployment for thousands of arena workers and businesses that support the nations' sports teams and events.  In a way, sports -- or the lack of them - serve as a litmus test for how serious this pandemic is.  Serious enough that President Trump has included commissioners from all the major US sports leagues on an advisory board to reopen the country.  In this episode, I talk about the impact of shutting down sports -- and what it would take for games to resume.  I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent. And this is ""Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction.""  NBA Announcer (March 11): The game tonight has been postponed. You are all safe.  Dr. Gupta: That was March 11th, when an announcer called off the Oklahoma City Thunder and Utah Jazz game just before tip-off.   Most of us remember that day -- it was the day President Trump announced the travel restrictions from Europe, the day Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson said they tested positive for Covid-19... And the day the NBA suspended the rest of the season after Rudy Gobert, the Utah Jazz center, had tested positive for the virus.  You may remember Gobert as the player who touched all the microphones at a Utah Jazz media event as a prank. He didn't know he was positive at the time, and later apologized for it.   I'm a huge basketball fan myself, so I was crushed when I heard the news of the NBA suspension. But of course, public health comes first.   CNN Sports Analyst Christine Brennan: To me, that really was the watershed moment in the entire coronavirus -- Covid-19 conversation, and not just in sports, but in our culture.  Dr. Gupta: Christine Brennan has been covering sports for three decades. She says she hasn't seen anything like this in her entire career.  Brennan: I think it woke the nation and the world, frankly, up to the significance and the seriousness of the coronavirus pandemic.  Dr. Gupta: After the NBA suspended its season, it was like a domino effect -- Major League Soccer and the NHL have suspended their seasons for now. While Major League Baseball is hoping to open its season in May, according to ESPN. And the NCAA canceled its spring and winter championships. As a Wolverine (go Blue!) I love March Madness. It's one of my favorite times of the year I even had tickets to the Final Four this year, so I was really disappointed when that didn't happen. But the threat to our health and safety was too great. And it wasn't just the safety of the fans, it was for the safety of the athletes too. ... A total of 11,000 Olympians, expected to compete in Tokyo this summer, have had their plans put on hold. The 2020 summer games now postponed until 2021. The games have been canceled three times before, but this is the first time they've been postponed.    And of course even a date that far ahead doesn't come without concerns, Christine Brennan told me.  Brennan: Will we, in the summer of 2021, will people feel comfortable flying on planes overseas? Will the Japanese fans feel comfortable being in big stadiums? And the answer is over and over, experts I've talked to -- we have no idea. We just do not know. But by that point, of course, a lot of these Olympic athletes will have lost months and months of training.  I just don't think we know yet. And I think that uncertainty is so difficult for athletes. Consider that Olympic athlete -- their whole lives for this one moment.  Olympic runner Abdi Abdirahman: First it was hard, you know, just as an athlete. We trained for it, you know, for almost a year to two years, just to make the Olympic team.  Dr. Gupta: That's Abdi Abdirahman, an Olympic distance runner -- 2020 was the fifth time he's qualified. At 43, he's also the oldest American to run the marathon in the Olympics.  Abdi Abdirahman: You know, like before the coronavirus hit, you know, you have a goal, like that's the one thing like you have, like road races coming up. You have something to get ready for. But at this time, everything's in the air. I ... I'm just training just to stay fit.  Dr. Gupta: And the sports world isn't just waiting on the sidelines in the midst of the pandemic -- Major League Baseball is now participating in a nationwide coronavirus antibody study.   League employees, spouses, and players volunteered to participate, to help give a better understanding of how prevalent this virus really is.   Daniel Eichner: So our goal is not to get MLB specifically back to work. Our goal and our research is really to get a better understanding of what the true prevalence looks like across the nation.  Dr. Gupta: I spoke with Daniel Eichner, the president and lab director of the Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory.  Eichner: They were a great partner and a great organization because they had nationwide coverage that we could access -- individuals that were asymptomatic, regular part of the general population, you know, from team owners all the way down to hot dog vendors and beer sales people on game day and everything in-between.   Dr. Gupta: You're looking at the MLB, it sounds like a sort of microcosm then of the country, representing different demographics of our country. Can you talk me through how it was administered then? And how quickly then did they get results?  Eichner: Some people could do a drive-through program where they had a bunch of their technicians, physicians, trainers and the individuals would just drive through, stick their finger out the window, get their finger prick and get the result literally in a matter of minutes.  Dr. Gupta: And it seems that most people would fundamentally want to know then, am I now essentially immune? Can I get infected again?  Eichner: I think it's too soon to say what that immunity looks like.   Dr. Gupta: Now, the federal government is slowly making plans to reopen the country. As I said earlier, President Trump has asked major league sports commissioners to be a part of that conversation.  The commissioners have a tough job -- they're weighing a lot of things in making the decision of how and when to get back to work.  Brennan: Commissioners work for the owners in their league. And the owners are going to want to start playing. They're going to want to start making money again. They're not liking the losses, the financial losses that they're taking, of course. No one is. The commissioners also have to weigh the very significant health risks, not just for the players and their families and the referees and the coaches and the TV people and the and the media people, but also the fans in the stands. And if you're drawing people into a stadium and if it becomes a coronavirus hotspot and all of a sudden it explodes -- that is the fear of every commissioner in every sport. You open up too soon, you bring people together and all of a sudden you have another coronavirus bomb. Dr. Gupta: Sports as we know it may not be the same for a long time.   The NFL draft, which starts tonight, will be held virtually for the first time, as was the WNBA draft last week. The league plans to start its regular season in September and the draft helps set that into motion. Here's NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell in an interview with ESPN.  Roger Goodell: Obviously, it's a different year for all of us. We had to make modifications in our off season program. We've had to make significant changes to our draft and those were all appropriate and they're right to do. And we, part of what this is about is to continue to work from home, be productive from home, continue to do things we're supposed to do and be prepared.  Dr. Gupta: There's also the possibility that spectator-less sports will become the new normal. Christine Brennan predicts that that will happen at the PGA men's golf tournament when it comes back in June, and the Masters in November.  Brennan: We could see a Masters without spectators. And that's going to look very strange to a lot of people.  Although my prediction here is that within a couple days of watching some of these sports events, if you watch a baseball game without spectators one day, it's not going to look as strange the next day. And by the third, the fourth day, you're going to be totally used to it and you're just going to be happy or watching baseball again. I think sports is walking this very fine line. It's kind of a tightrope. We want sports back. It'll make people happy. It'll signal this openness that maybe we're coming out of this. And yet you don't wanna move too fast. Dr. Gupta: Olympic runner Abdi Abdirahman thinks that the 2021 Olympics will be a history-making, record-breaking year.  Abdirahman: I think it's gonna -- it's gonna unite us. We're gonna have so much energy, like a lot of things when every athlete wants to represent their country because they know what their country went through. So everybody wants to do their best.   Dr. Gupta: Magic Johnson also remains hopeful.  Johnson: Look, America and all of us who live in this great country that we live in, we need sports, especially in a time like this, but only if everybody is safe.   Dr. Gupta: One day, live sports will come back. We'll be able to fill basketball arenas, cheer for our teams in giant stadiums, bring our sons and daughters to baseball fields.   I'm looking forward to that day. But our health and our safety should always matter most. Especially now. We'll be back tomorrow. Thanks for listening.

47,CNN,"Dr. Gupta: Today is Earth Day. A day for celebrating and appreciating our planet, and embracing the outdoors. But this year, many of us find ourselves stuck indoors, and with very little to celebrate.  Coronavirus has upended our lives, but it's also teaching us lessons about ourselves, and our planet. I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent. And this is ""Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction."" Dr. Gupta: For this special Earth Day episode, I wanted to ask Bill about the connections between climate and coronavirus. Our conversation though started on a personal note ... the birth of his son 15 days ago.  Weir: So grateful to have this little bundle, this nugget of new life and love to focus on in the middle of this nightmare. Dr. Gupta: I can only, only imagine. A huge congratulations to you and Kelly. What was the experience like in the hospital? Weir: Well you know, they've really sort of sealed off the neonatal and maternity ward to keep it humming regardless of what was going on outside. The coronavirus patients are in a different building. So we came in and we had her in my mask that I used for covering wildfires. It was the only mask I could find. Almost bought one off of eBay for 600 bucks from some profiteer because we were so worried. But then I remembered I had this mask that I used to cover the last round of wildfires. And, you know, she kissed our baby through that mask for the first time, which is sort of a poignant parallel between, you know, climate crisis and the pandemic that we're in right now and how they all relate.  Dr. Gupta: Bill, one thing I just want to make sure we're making clear as well is there is a parallel between all the work you do and report on with regard to climate change and what is happening now with this pandemic. Right? I mean, if it's the infringements on these areas, deforestation ... what is the parallel between this pandemic and climate change?   Weir: I think the most obvious one is that for a very long time, very smart scientists said, ""If we're not careful and we cut down all the jungles, we're going to unleash an invisible enemy that's gonna come out of those jungles and get into our lungs."" But that was a story that few people wanted to hear. And for an even longer time, very smart scientists have been saying, ""If we're not careful, an invisible enemy is going to come out of our factories and our cars and our homes. And it's going to get into the sky and the sea, and it's going to disrupt life as we know it. We're going to lose the ability to predict the weather.""  And that was a story that too few people wanted to believe. And when it comes to the responses, look at the countries that waited until people started dying to act. They're the ones suffering the most. Whereas you look at South Korea, where they have a respect for expertise and a knowledge and a belief that we're all in this together and we can quench this thing. They flatten the curve. I mean, I'm so happy that ""flatten the curve"" is now part of our vernacular because we can do the same thing with climate. Whether that's a global effort of the smartest people around the world cooperating to either find a vaccine for this particular virus, or to come up with a way to power our lives in a clean, sustainable way.  Dr. Gupta: It is hard to believe that we're sort of in this self-quarantine on Earth Day. I mean, no matter how good your predictive skills are, I think very few people would have been able to predict that.  Weir: It was predicted! ... You know, there are just as, maybe not as many, scientists who've been warning about climate change for over a century. We've had virus hunters saying this was a very real hazard. But again, we're just not wired to think in these terms, I think. You know, we evolved to fear the noise behind the bush and try to figure out, ""Is that a stick or a snake?"" And we think about immediate threats, and time rubs the edges off of our fear. It's a reminder that when our smartest scientists say, ""Something really bad could happen, if we're not careful"" -- we should probably pay attention to that and certainly not politicize that.   Dr. Gupta: There's been a lot of pictures, and you see how quick things change in terms of the impact in the acute environment at least. The air's a little cleaner. There's the birds that are chirping in Wuhan, which I guess hadn't happened in a while. We get to see what happens when human activities on the planet come to somewhat of a halt. What does that teach us about the human impact on the environment?   Weir: Well, I think it teaches us just how much the human footprint is literally on everything. You know, that we have paved and plowed and developed so much of the Earth and there's so few places left, you know, where the wild things are. And, you know, creatures and ecosystems that took millions of years to settle into a harmonious balance. We have absolutely upended within a blink of Earth time. But they can bounce back if you give them space. There's this thing called the ""sliding baseline syndrome,"" which is that, you know, you walk on a beach and with your kid and you say, ""Man, when I was a boy, the stars, the Milky Way, it was incredible."" He doesn't know what you're talking about. What he knows is what he can see, and so when he teaches his kids, the baseline has moved. Well, now that we've sort of reversed it for a brief moment in time and can show our kids, ""That's what the Milky Way looks like."" Dr. Gupta: It is human psychology, I guess, to some extent, and maybe it's the way that we are wired for good reason, that acute threats are the things that we're gonna pay most attention to. But if the rock isn't about to hit me in the face, I'm probably not going to worry about it as much. How do you get the messages across? Because I think there's a lot of parallels here.  Weir: Yeah, I mean, when it comes to a pandemic, the most extreme measures you take will seem over the top before it happens and will seem, you know, completely inadequate after the fact. And it's kind of the same with climate. That will mean everything has to change. Everything. Transportation, construction, our food supply, geopolitics, economics. And that's such a seismic thing to a species that sort of likes things the way they are. That's such a big ask. And if we do all of those things, it will seem excessive. But if we don't do those things, it's going to change anyway.  Dr. Gupta: I'm wondering, Bill, for you, I'm sure talking to people who fully understand what you're saying. You talk to people who are flat out denying it. And then there are people in between who say, ""I don't disagree with you, but it seems like the cat's out of the bag here. We're never getting that cat back in the bag."" How do you have those conversations with people, especially with regard to the inevitability? Weir: Yes, I think we have to be honest and you have to prepare our children for what's coming. If we could go back in time, six months, wouldn't we prepare our kids for this lockdown? Wouldn't we prepare them for saying goodbye to grandma for the last time? All of those sorts of things.  Dr. Gupta: You know, Bill, I think about our own childhood. I think we're around the same age. I don't really remember talking about climate change that much when I was a kid. No wars, good economy, no existential threat hanging over our heads, and obviously no pandemic. Not like this. And you're bringing a child into the world. I have kids who, their world has been defined by these things. I just wonder how do you think about that? I've been thinking about that a lot as a dad lately.   Weir: Yeah. No, I, believe me, especially in lockdown and staring into his little eyes during those midnight feedings. And you know, best scientists in the world say, ""Life as we know it is at risk if we don't change our ways within a decade."" And people scoff and say, ""Well, the end of the world!"" Yeah, well, like it's all going to explode on one Saturday afternoon. No, the planet will spin on. We're seeing how life can come back if you leave it alone. It's us that's at risk. It's life as we know it. It's the modern world that's built on predictable growing seasons and supply chains and flight schedules. And this is sort of what I think is a dry run for what my child's life is going to look like, only in hyper lapse, in hyper speed. Dr. Gupta: Bill, you and I have been doing this job for a long time. And I'm reminded after disasters and even conflicts that, people forget. They move back to the way it was. Will this be different, do you think?  Weir: That's such a good question. You know, I think I'm worried that there's such a thing called ""revenge pollution,"" that when a country like China has to shut down manufacturing, once they ramp back up, they, they go double time. They run the smokestacks 24/7. You know, the thing is, ultimately, while you can see the stars and people saying, ""Oh, this might help fix our crisis."" It won't. I would love to think that this is a wake-up call for these 7 billion-plus people on the planet. I'm afraid not. And I think it's going to take real leadership. And to solve the problem of climate demands such cooperation, both from allies and enemies. And unfortunately, Covid is the crisis that makes us all wear masks and has made the handshake obsolete when we need human connection more than ever. But I hope we understand that our relationship with this big blue marble, you know, every day is Earth Day. Every day is Earth Day. We exist at great peril if we forget that.  Dr. Gupta: The other day, I caught one of my teenage daughters getting up really early in the morning, and she loves to sleep, so I wasn't sure what was going on. But it turns out she wanted to watch the sunrise, since the skies have been unusually clear, thanks to the shutdown. I wish my daughters lived in a world where the skies were always clear, and not just a rare sight. Right now, we're seeing people around the world make sacrifices and unite against a common enemy. And it's frightening, for sure, but I also find it inspiring. Just shows what we can accomplish when we all work together.  Hopefully we can do the same to save our Earth and give our children a better future.  You can watch Bill's new documentary ""The Road to Change"" on CNN this Saturday. We'll be back tomorrow.

49,CNN,"Today we'll talk about the risks facing those who are struggling with addiction and also what resources are available to help them. I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent. And this is ""Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction."" Dr. Gupta: After weeks of isolating ourselves to stop the spread of coronavirus, many of us still haven't been able to settle into a new routine. I know I've had a hard time with it myself. That kind of disruption can take a toll, especially for those who are in the process of trying to make a change in their lives -- like getting sober.  Anthony B.: When I was first getting sober, that was instilled in me. And I had a regimen at certain meetings that I went to. I called my sponsor on a daily basis. And once that routine was set, it really helped it become second nature so that it didn't become a chore. Dr. Gupta: That's Anthony B. We agreed not to use his last name to protect his privacy. Anthony is an alcoholic who has been in recovery for seven years.  When he was in the throes of addiction, most of his substance abuse took place at home, alone.  Anthony B.: I know for me, I didn't need to be in a club or in a bar or anything like that. I could just be in my house and stop off at the liquor store and go in the house. Dr. Gupta: With so many people isolating during this pandemic, on their own, Anthony worries those who struggle with substance abuse are especially vulnerable.   Anthony B.: So imagine someone who has just recently gotten sober and has been going to meetings and then all the sudden now they're just in the house. The place where everything happened. You're walking around and I'm looking, 'Oh, that's where I used to put a bottle or, oh, look at the glasses.'  Dr. Gupta: Anthony is no longer able to attend his regular Alcoholics Anonymous meeting in person. So he's joined the meetings online, over Zoom.  Anthony B.: The interesting part about it for me was having people check in from Australia, the UK, Louisiana, North Dakota, Virginia. I mean, it was all over. And so instantly for me, I felt connected like, OK, this is how we're going to do it. This is what we're gonna do to get us through this period. Dr. Gupta: But here's the thing, connecting online may not be enough for everyone. Dr. Nora Volkow is the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse at the National Institutes of Health. Pretty early on, Dr. Volkow became concerned about how the pandemic would impact those struggling with substance abuse. Dr. Nora Volkow, Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), National Institutes of Health: I started to worry in February. But it wasn't really until March that I started to recognize how devastating this could be to individuals that have problems with substance abuse. Dr. Gupta: As Covid-19 patients fill hospitals all over the country, Dr. Volkow says it is imperative that health care workers prevent this stigma surrounding addiction from influencing how they administer care. Dr. Volkow: They are discriminated on the basis that they believe that people do this to themselves. And therefore, you have to owe it, the consequences, to your own choices. And in fact, this is something that patients will tell you that have a problem with drugs and why they don't like to go see a doctor or go to the hospital because they are mistreated.   Addiction is one of the most stigmatized, if not the most stigmatized disease.  Dr. Gupta: Fortunately, she says, there have already been some changes to the way care is provided for those with substance use disorders.   Dr. Volkow: Telehealth has exploded and it has been incorporated into everyday practice so rapidly. Dr. Gupta: Dr. Volkow adds that treatment for drug addiction, however, has been especially challenging. Dr. Volkow: Many of the methadone clinics are closing. Their doors are limiting the number of patients that can go in.  Dr. Gupta: Normally, methadone can only be prescribed after an in-person evaluation, and must be taken in the clinic. But now some methadone clinics are making it easier to get multiple doses of the medication, and to be able to take it at home. Dr. Volkow: So these changes give us a different perspective of how we may be able to treat people that are addicted to drugs while also forcing us to see the issues that we need to solve and address. Dr. Gupta: It's not just illicit substances that pose a threat during this pandemic, but legal ones as well. Because Covid-19 impacts the lungs, the Food and Drug Administration has advised that those who smoke cigarettes may be at increased risk and have worse outcomes from the virus.  And while there isn't any data showing how the pandemic has impacted rates of alcohol use disorder, people do appear to be buying a lot of alcohol. According to Nielsen, sales of alcoholic beverages increased 55% in the last week of march compared to the same time last year.   That may be partly as a result of liquor stores being deemed essential businesses in most states. And while there has been some criticism of that designation, Dr. Volkow points out that having access to alcohol could in some situations be safer for alcoholics. Dr. Volkow: If you are addicted to alcohol and you don't have access to alcohol and you go through withdrawal, that's extremely severe and you can literally die from alcohol withdrawal.  Dr. Gupta: But Anthony B. -- who has been in recovery for seven years -- worries about the temptation for people who are still struggling.  Anthony B.: My first instinct was like, damn, that sucks, you know? There's definitely some people out there that are suffering, and I feel for them when I see liquor stores open. I hope they realize that that's not an essential. But I don't know that that's going to happen.  Dr. Gupta: The World Health Organization recently issued a statement saying excessive drinking can weaken the immune system and they recommended limiting access to alcohol during this pandemic.  Of course, it's one thing to discourage people from excessive substance use during this uncertain time, and another to make sure they have the support they need to do so. Anthony has a simple suggestion for anyone who's currently having a hard time: pick up the phone.  Anthony B.: If people aren't, you know, really into the whole technology thing, just call people. It makes such a difference. And what's, what's interesting is that if I call someone, it helps them more than it helps me. Like I'm calling because I want to stay sober, but they'll say thank you for calling me because I was going through X, Y and Z and then they might call somebody else. Dr. Gupta: Dealing with addiction is enormously difficult under any circumstance and we don't want to minimize this at all. Dealing with it during a pandemic adds a whole new set of challenges. If you're in need of resources or support, the substance abuse and mental health services administration operates a helpline 24/7. The number is 1-800-662-4357. There's help out there. We'll be back tomorrow. Thanks for listening.

51,CNN,"In the first phase, places like gyms, movie theaters, and restaurants will be allowed to reopen, as long as they follow strict social distancing protocols. The second would allow schools and bars to reopen with reduced occupancy. And people can start taking trips for nonessential travel.   And in the final stage, vulnerable individuals no longer would have to stay home, as long as they continue social distancing measures. And employers could allow employees to return to work. That might involve regular testing and daily screening. These guidelines are just that -- they lay out a path to getting back to normal life. But exactly when and how states decide to follow them is up to state and local officials. So where do we go from here? And when and how will we know the time is right? I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent, and this is ""Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction.""  Dr. Gupta: First, let's take a look at what some other countries have already done -- and what that might mean for us here in the US. We spoke to an English teacher in Wuhan, China, where the outbreak is believed to have started. Doug Perez: My name is Doug Perez. Obviously, I've lived in Wuhan through the outbreak. I live here with my dog and my girlfriend. Dr. Gupta: Since January, people like Doug have been in lockdown;  some residents haven't been allowed to leave their homes or gated communities for months.   Perez: It got so bad that, you know, at some point during the lockdown, my girlfriend, she needed some medicine for something unrelated to the coronavirus. The community wasn't letting us out for anything. So, you know, I've had to climb over a fence and literally go to the pharmacy. Dr. Gupta: After 76 days -- on April 8th -- the lockdown was lifted in Wuhan and people can now leave their neighborhoods. Perez:  People are out and about. You're even starting to see some families. Everyone's wearing masks. There are a lot of people out. There's even traffic. Now things are really returning to normal.  Dr. Gupta: To be clear, Chinese officials have warned that they still have to be cautious and control measures will remain in place.  But how will we in the United States get back to normal, or at least closer to it?   I asked someone who's no stranger to epidemics: Dr. Tom Frieden, former Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dr. Frieden ran the CDC during the Ebola crisis in 2014.    Now, he's the president of Resolve to Save Lives, a nonprofit initiative that aims to make the world safer from epidemics.  Last week, his nonprofit released a plan for reopening society called ""Box It In."" It outlines four steps for containing the virus: testing, isolating, contact tracing and quarantining. I asked Dr. Frieden to explain his plan.   Dr. Tom Frieden (President and CEO, Resolve to Save Lives): So let's take each of the four corners of that box for testing. Your local government. Your state government is going to tell you who's priority for testing. And we want to make sure that people with symptoms of Covid get tested. We want to make sure that especially health care workers with symptoms of Covid get tested. Anyone who is in a nursing home or homeless shelter or prison get tested. But if you are infected, you have to isolate yourself and really isolate yourself, because you could spread it to someone who could die from it.  On the contact tracing. If you're a case, you need to figure out from 48 hours before your first symptom until you isolated yourself completely. Who is everyone you might have exposed? And get all of those people's information down and either let them know yourself or work through the local health department to inform them. And then if you're one of those people who's been exposed, you need to quarantine yourself. You need to be not going out because you could feel fine, but in that first day or two of illness be highly infectious. That means you need to stay home. If we do those four things well, we can reduce the spread and make each successive wave smaller, to put Covid in a smaller and smaller box so we can go out to more places more safely. Dr. Gupta: When you think about the box that way, these four pressures that you're putting on the virus. How hard is this?  Dr. Frieden: It's extraordinarily difficult. This is a highly infectious virus. There is spread from people before they have symptoms. There is some spread from people who will never have symptoms. And the challenge is to target our testing well so we find cases promptly. And find contacts. Contact tracing is a tried and true public health method.   Dr. Gupta: You have said based, I think, on some of the modeling data out of Wuhan, that in order to contact trace appropriately and have enough people to do it, you're talking hundreds of thousands of people potentially. It's like a new industry. Is this a challenge we can overcome? Can we actually get to the point where we can box in the virus the way that you're describing it?  Dr. Frieden: Our lives and our economy depend on it. What we have to do is fairly clear. We know what to do. But doing it quickly and at scale, that's the challenge. And doing that means really revolutionizing our public health system, which has been underinvested in. In this case, we're going to have to really ramp up our ability to test, trace, to isolate, to quarantine and look at the best practices from all over the world. These are not easy things to do, but they are essential things to do.  Dr. Gupta: It all seems to come back to testing. The numbers of tests have gone up. But I still get calls. I don't know if you do. Dr. Frieden, even a couple of calls I've gotten from health care folks around the country, that told me they still had a hard time getting tests themselves as health care workers who were making rounds in the hospital. Where do we stand with testing and is it someone's responsibility? I know you don't want to get into the politics of this -- but whose responsible?  Dr. Frieden: It is absolutely the federal government's responsibility. Currently, we're doing in this country less than 150,000 tests a day. We released a report and we calculated quite simply, if we were just testing the highest priority people and nobody else, we'd need about three times as many tests. And if we tried to test really extensively, it would be 10, 20 times that. Now, it's not going to be possible to test everybody we'd like to test anytime soon, but that doesn't mean it's hopeless.   Dr. Gupta: Listening to what you're saying, it does seem like short of a vaccine, we are going to be at this for a while. Should we do all these things but really anticipate mostly staying at home until a vaccine comes out?  Dr. Frieden: This is a long war. We're not going to have a vaccine anytime soon unless something very unexpected happens. We have to get used to a new normal. In this new normal, we're not going to shake hands. We're not going to go out if we're sick. We're going to figure out a way to cover our mouth and nose. We're going to be teleworking more, even when things open up. We're going to be sheltering and shielding those who have underlying health conditions and the elderly. But if we take it one step at a time and loosen the faucet gradually, we can get back to this new normal.  Dr. Gupta: Is there a country around the world that you've been watching that they have done it right in terms of early testing, isolation, tracing and now being very deliberate and thoughtful about reopening?   Dr. Frieden: There are countries around the world that are in this process. It's still early days. Iceland, Germany, South Korea, Singapore have all taken really thoughtful approaches and they've been able to keep the virus to lower levels than other countries. We also really do need to learn from China. China has been battling this virus longer than any other country. They're using extraordinary measures. They've traced more than 720,000 people. They have internal quarantines. So, if you travel from one part of the country to another, you've got to quarantine for 14 days. They're doing millions of tests and they're finding thousands of asymptomatically infected people. They're isolating those people. They're quarantining people's contacts. It's an extraordinary effort. I don't know if other countries are going to be able to replicate that, but we can certainly adapt it and learn from it.  Dr. Gupta: I'm not a Pollyannaish, sort of person, I am an optimistic person. Is there anything good that's come out of all this?  Dr. Frieden: I hope that coming out of this we'll recognize that there are thousands of life-threatening gaps in our ability to find, stop and prevent infectious diseases, and that we as a world will make a commitment to holding ourselves accountable for closing those gaps. It is absolutely inevitable that there will be another epidemic, another pandemic in the future. What's not inevitable is that we will continue to be so underprepared. Dr. Gupta: Reopening isn't going to happen overnight. We all have to do our part to practice physical distancing and listen to our local officials. We also have to remember that the information and recommendations may change. After all we are dealing with a novel or new coronavirus, something human beings have never seen before.

53,CNN,"Everybody wants to be empowered at times like these. We don't want to be helpless. And a big part of that is reaching out and making a difference. So today, I'm going to talk about some ways that you can give back. I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent. And this is ""Coronavirus, Fact vs. Fiction."" Jonathan ""Bear"" Yeung (from video): Covid-19 is horrible. People are sick, people are dying. I want to help our hard-working doctors and nurses stay strong in fighting to save lives. Dr. Gupta: That's 9-year old Jonathan Yeung -- who goes by the nickname Bear. He's from North Vancouver. He made headlines by raising more than $2,000. He did it in just two days, to buy healthy snacks for healthcare workers at his local hospital.  I spoke to Bear, who like many other kids, is currently out of school. Bear: I felt a little bit happy because I got a longer spring break, but then I was kind of worried because I didn't know when school was going to start again and I was sad, I couldn't see my classmates that much.  Dr. Gupta: What is it that you miss the most?  Bear:  High fives. Playing tag, sometimes playing tag. Dr. Gupta: Playing tag ... When you decided that you wanted to do something about this yourself. What inspired you to do that?  Bear: It started when I overheard my dad's conversation with his friend, Dr. Amar, who works in Washington State. He said doctors and nurses are working very long hours and sometimes don't have time to eat.  Dr. Gupta: So what did you do?  Bear: After that phone call, I decided to get healthy snacks and nutritional bars, coconut water and sports drinks. Dr. Gupta: I love that, Bear. I think everyone who hears that loves it. They want to know how you did it. Bear: First, I donated all my $70 -- my savings of $70. Then I made a lot of phone calls to friends and family around the world. And so far, I have donations from Canada, Asia, USA, Australia and Germany.  Dr. Gupta: When you were delivering these supplies, the bars and the electrolyte fluids to the hospital, I'm sure that had to have been a really gratifying thing. You must have felt really good about it. Can you tell me about some of the reaction that you got from people?  Bear: Happy and, I think, grateful reactions, I'm pretty sure. And I felt very responsible. Dr. Gupta: Even at his young age, Bear is one of the countless people going to extraordinary lengths to help. Becky Hoeffler is another example. She works at Duke University in North Carolina, but over a month ago, she started shopping for the elderly on her lunch breaks. Becky Hoeffler: It actually came about when I called my grandfather the other day. He told me, ""I'm on my way to the grocery store,"" and I was just kind of concerned. He's 91, and I thought, ""Is there a reason you have to go to the grocery store?"" Dr. Gupta: Like Becky, many others across the country are stepping up and doing things like buying groceries for other more vulnerable folks who probably shouldn't be doing it themselves. Hoeffler: Utilizing people power I think is one of the best ways we can combat the virus. Dr. Gupta: I love that. People power. We are seeing people from all walks of life come together to support their local businesses, their healthcare workers and their communities.  People who've had coronavirus are also giving back. Through donating their blood for an experimental treatment known as convalescent plasma. Diana Berrent recently recovered from Covid-19. Last week she told my colleague John Berman why she's excited to donate blood now that she's virus-free. Diana Berrent: This is a way that you can give back. And that's a very motivating factor when you're home and you're sick and you're scared. And to know that in a couple of weeks you can go out and save lives. I called the New York blood bank and got the first possible appointment and I'll be going in tomorrow to donate my plasma. Dr. Gupta: All of this is humankind at it's best. Inspiring and uplifting.  But there are still a lot of challenges that could use your help. We've seen a spike in hunger across the country, as millions of people have lost their jobs and income due to cities being virtually shut down.  Derrick Chubbs: Normally here in central Texas, we distribute food to about 50,000 central Texans every single week. Dr. Gupta: That's Derrick Chubbs, CEO of the Central Texas Food Bank, in Austin. Chubbs: But what we've been seeing based on the Covid-19 virus is just in the month of March alone, we saw an increase of well over 207% of those that were seeking our services. Dr. Gupta: We heard the same thing from Eric Cooper, CEO of the San Antonio Food Bank.  Pictures of seemingly endless lines of cars went viral last Thursday as the organization gave out more than a million pounds of food. Their largest single-day distribution in their 40-year history.   Eric warned that food bank supplies could soon run short. Eric Cooper: It has been incredibly difficult to really rely on philanthropy to meet this wave of need. We're always in some ways rationing our food to try to meet the need, but in the Covid-19 crisis, it's just having enough food. So we're really hoping for more state and federal support to come our way to be able to meet this need. Dr. Gupta: I know many of you want to help. I hear it from you all the time. So here at CNN, our ""Impact Your World"" team has compiled an interactive guide to connect you with organizations helping those affected by the crisis. CNN Producer Mayra Cuevas: We have over 10 categories, including arts, food support, people with disabilities, restaurants, refugees and international relief, among others. And we're still adding some. It lets readers customize their giving around their passion points.  Dr. Gupta: That's Mayra Cuevas from our ""Impact Your World"" team. Each section on the website takes you to a list of vetted charities where you can donate or get involved. And, if you're listening today and looking for help yourself, we also have a list of resources to get you the help you need. Cuevas: In every section in the interactive guide, if there was an organization that was providing help, we tried to list it. The mental health section is a great example of that. If you're struggling with stress, depression or anxiety, there are multiple crisis lines where you can call, text or email. Some organizations are offering virtual AA groups, help for victims of domestic violence, and support for the LGBTQ community. There are so many opportunities for people to get the help that you need.  Dr. Gupta: You can find those resources at cnn.com/coronavirus ""How to Help."" You can also head to that page and nominate organizations you know are making a difference.  I've said it before, I'll say it again: the one way we can all make a difference, wherever you are, is by staying home and practicing physical distancing. I know it's hard. I really do, but at least for now it is really crucial. It's going to help flatten the curve that's going to help lessens the burden on hospitals and our healthcare heroes. We'll be back Monday.

55,CNN,"How do you make a genuine connection through a computer screen? How does a relationship survive without intimacy or physical touch? How can we feel a sense of closeness when we're physically apart? I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent. And this is Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction."" (From ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,"" March 12) Host Stephen Colbert: Should people still date? Dr. Gupta: Everything is a risk -- Colbert: Blind date?  Dr. Gupta: Uh, no. No, no, no blind dates. Colbert: Tinder? Dr. Gupta: Definitely not. But even before this, no Tinder. I'm kidding.   Dr. Gupta: That was me on ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert"" a month ago, before most of the country was staying at home.  At the time, a conversation about dating during a pandemic may have felt like late-night comedy fare.  Dr. Gupta (On ""The Late Show""): You know, Steven, everything in life is a risk-reward proposition. Is it riskier to do things versus before? Perhaps. Being in close contact with somebody, especially somebody you don't know, is -- it's a different time right now.  Dr. Gupta: But as our new reality has evolved, so has the act of finding love. People are using dating apps more; both Tinder and Bumble have reported an increase in daily messages and user engagement. Other apps have added a video chat feature. And some people are reaching out in ways I would have never imagined. Jeremy Cohen (on TikTok video): I looked out my window and saw this girl dancing, perhaps to a TikTok song. I needed to say hi to her. So, I waved out on my balcony. She waved back.  Dr. Gupta: That's the start of a story you may have heard before. It's from a video on TikTok by Jeremy Cohen, a photographer from Brooklyn, New York.  After Jeremy waves to the dancing girl, he flies his drone over with his cell phone number. Jeremy Cohen (TikTok): She picked up my drone, and I guess it worked because I got a text from her an hour later.  Dr. Gupta: Jeremy's video went viral -- if we're still allowed to say that. It has over 30 million views on TikTok now. I'm not at all surprised. It's the meet-cute of our time, if our time is defined by isolation and physical distancing.  Jeremy and Tori Cignarella -- she's the girl on the roof -- have gone on a few dates after that. Here's Jeremy and Tori: Cohen: The first date was: We had dinner, except there was no restaurant. She was on her roof, and I was on my balcony. Tori Cignarella: It was so funny because we'd be talking to each other on FaceTime. And then sometimes I'd, like, look over -- like, I'd see him there, and then we'd look at each other. It was like such a weird scenario. Cohen: It was lovely. And it lasted until her phone died. Dr. Gupta: On another date, Jeremy went inside a huge plastic bubble so he and Tori could take a walk.  Cignarella: I just couldn't stop laughing. I, like, hit the ground, basically. I just, like, was not expecting to see him in a bubble.  Dr. Gupta: It's a lot more effort to go through than your average date. And it's hard to express the usual social and physical cues when you're 6 feet apart. But there are things about this new normal that, for Jeremy Cohen, surprisingly work well. Cohen: It's really nice to get to know her and just not have any of this pressure or, like, at the end of the date, like, OK, am I going home or am I going to invite her back to my place or go back to her place? This awkward moment of, OK, what is the other person thinking?  I don't want to be too forward. But I also don't want to be a scaredy cat.  Dr. Gupta: Jeremy isn't immune to the loneliness of social distancing, of not actually being physically around someone, even though he's found this new connection. Cohen: I am alone in my apartment. I have a roommate, but he's with his family in Minnesota. So, I'm all alone in this two-bedroom apartment for about a month now.  It makes me realize how much the small things in life such as a hug -- like, hugs feel great. I've actually tried hugging myself a couple of times. Doesn't feel the same. Dr. Gupta: Because it isn't the same. There's a lot of research that shows how physical touch is important for our health and well-being.  Professor Brooke Feeney: One behavior that we have focused on in some of our research is interpersonal touch or affectionate touch. We've shown that touch has powerful effects on our physical health, our mental health, our relationship health. Dr. Gupta: That's Professor Brooke Feeney. She's a social psychologist at Carnegie Mellon University. She studies how relationships impact our health throughout our entire lives. Feeney: It increases feelings of security, so it just makes people feel more secure. It increases people's willingness to embrace life opportunities. Affection and touch has been associated with lower daily stress, lower reactivity to stress, a lower likelihood of even perceiving something as stressful in the first place.  Dr. Gupta: For Professor Feeney, affectionate touch has benefits even above and beyond sexual intimacy, which is something else we're missing in a time of isolation. Feeney: People can engage in sexual intimacy for a variety of reasons that have to do with reproduction and drives and less to do with communicating care and acceptance and love and value and so on. They're both important forms of touch and communicate very important information to significant others. But we think that they are very different types of processes. Dr. Gupta: Hearing about all the benefits of touch at a time when a lot of people are deprived of it isn't exactly comforting. So, what happens when we do lose it in our everyday lives? Here's (Syracuse University Assistant) Professor Brittany Jakubiak, who studies affectionate touch in romantic relationships. Professor Brittany Jakubiak: Children form attachment with their caregivers in a lot of ways through touch. And in adulthood, we think that some of the same processes happen. So, you form an attachment to your romantic partner just like you form an attachment to your parents, although the relationship is obviously different. Long term, not having the ability to touch, I think there's the possibility that you may not be able to form as secure of an attachment to that person. Dr. Gupta: But Professor Jakubiak doesn't want to overstate the benefits of touch either. It is still possible to have meaningful connections with each other without it. Jakubiak: We know that people maintain very satisfying long-distance relationships, even when there's not a pandemic going on. People do things like reminiscing about times that they did spend together or planning times that they will spend together. And so, I think we can find ways, at least if this is going to be a somewhat short-term separation, to make sure that we're maintaining high-quality relationships even through physical distance Dr. Gupta: For Professor Feeney, there is a positive outcome -- at least in terms of human connection -- about the fact that this is all happening to us together. Feeney: Our rates of loneliness and social isolation, even before the pandemic, had been increasing, and people have just been feeling more relationally disconnected across the board.  One positive thing that I think has come out of this pandemic is that people, first of all, are all in this together.  You know, so we're now all part of a big in group of people who all this is happening to. And then, when people are facing adversities together, they usually reach out to each other more and try to connect. And so, I do see one positive side effect of this is that there are these more creative ways that people are trying to connect and help each other out and so on.  Dr. Gupta: Like Jeremy and Tori. And whether or not they end up together doesn't even matter to them anymore. Cignarella: We're absolutely going to meet up. Probably something a little bit more low-key, like drinks. But, you know, definitely still could never forget it. Honestly, no matter what happens between us, like, we're going to remain friends, like, there's nothing like this that doesn't bond two people. And I, like, literally said it to my mom, I'm just like, look, if he's not in my wedding, he'll be at my wedding. Like, that's for certain.  Dr. Gupta: That's a powerful connection. Now, there was a study from Harvard that came out this week saying we might have to prolong intermittent social distancing measures up until 2022.  Professor Feeney doesn't know what that means for our physical and mental health. No one does. She and a team of researchers at Carnegie Mellon are just about to begin a study on this. Feeney: If we don't find these other creative ways to connect, it remains to be seen how well we can continue to use remote connections as a proxy for the more physical connections. But I think the core issue that underlies it all is what touch communicates. And so, I think what we have to do during the pandemic is just find other ways to communicate to our loved ones that we're available to them if they need us, even though we can't be physically proximal to them right now. It might be more difficult to communicate that remotely, but I think we can do it. Dr. Gupta: Human beings are social creatures by nature: We crave connection; we're not meant to be isolated. These days, some people might not have the security that comes from physical touch, but that's not all a relationship is built on. Find those other connections and lean on them. I think you'll be surprised by how strongly they'll resonate in your life. We'll be back tomorrow. Thanks for listening.

57,CNN,"So, in this episode I'll explain exactly what antibodies are and how they could help the country get back on its feet.  I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent. And this is ""Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction."" Tony Huston: I think it's human nature to want to know if you've had it or if you have the antibodies. Dr. Gupta: That's Tony Huston, who got tested for Covid-19 antibodies in San Jose, California, earlier this month. We'll come back to him later.  So, what are antibodies? Antibodies are proteins in the immune system that are created soon after an infection. They can be identified with a quick blood test -- also called a serology test. It won't tell you whether the virus is currently active in your body, just whether it has ever been active in your body. This is key, because so many people who have had Covid-19, have not displayed any symptoms. We don't know for sure whether having had the virus gives you immunity against it, but health experts do suspect that's the case.  Last week, White House Coronavirus Task Force member Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN that a test is coming soon. Dr. Anthony Fauci (April 10): I'm certain that, that's gonna happen. That within a period of a week or so we're going to have a rather large number of tests that are available. Dr. Gupta: So, what is the test?  Compared to the Covid-19 diagnosis test -- which is an invasive nose swab typically -- this test is pretty simple. It's just a finger prick to draw a small blood sample. That blood sample is then put on a test strip that contains proteins from the virus. So, if your blood reacts to the strip, it means you have antibodies.  And why does antibody testing matter? Well, there are several reasons it's important to know who has antibodies against Covid-19 and might be immune to it. Besides peace of mind, of course. Those who test positive for antibodies can likely resume their normal lives -- go back to work, visit friends -- without fear of infecting others or getting sick again.  This might especially be helpful for healthcare workers and essential workers who could do their important jobs without worrying.  Widespread antibody testing would also give us a better sense of exactly where the virus is. It could be true that a significant number of people have had Covid-19 without realizing it.  Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Dr. Robert Redfield addressed this on NBC's ""The Today Show."" CDC Director Robert Redfield (April 13):  Antibody testing's going to give us a good idea from a surveillance point of view of- of how significant the outbreak was. And in certain circumstances I think it will help bring consumer confidence in certain workforces. Dr. Gupta: So, the benefits of antibody testing are clear. But how soon could any of us actually reap those benefits?   As of this recording, only one Covid-19 antibody test has emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration. So be aware of bad antibody tests being offered online. They might give you false results.  FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn was asked about this on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn (April 12): What we don't want are wildly inaccurate tests because that's going to be much worse -- having a wildly inaccurate test -- than having no test.  Dr. Gupta: Despite that risk, some places are starting to test people anyway.  Santa Clara County in California, Miami-Dade County in Florida, and Telluride, Colorado, are a few places now conducting antibody tests. And the National Institutes of Health are recruiting up to 10,000 volunteers for antibody testing as well.   Tony Huston, who we heard from at the beginning, was able to register to get tested for antibodies in Santa Clara County. We spoke to him about his experience.  Huston: They had about five different tents set up and you just kind of drove through and they pricked your finger, took a blood sample and took down your information. I've recently contacted them to find out when we're going to get the results. I think they're hoping to get those done and out to everybody by the end of this week.  Dr. Gupta: Huston said he never got tested for Covid-19 but he was really sick back in January with several of the common symptoms of the disease. He said part of the reason he wanted to get tested for antibodies was to help researchers find out whether the coronavirus could have arrived in the United States sooner than they realized.  Plus, he has some underlying conditions like heart disease and diabetes.  Huston: I think in some ways it would actually be a relief to know if I did have it prior. Then I don't think I would necessarily feel like I have to be as cautious as I guess I am being right now. Dr. Gupta: Knowing who has antibodies against Covid-19 could also speed up the search for a cure.  At last week's CNN Town Hall, my colleague Anderson Cooper and I spoke to a recovered coronavirus patient whose plasma is now being used to treat current patients. Here's Jason Garcia. Jason Garcia: They take the blood, it goes through a machine, they separate it out, and they put the blood back in. And they just collect the plasma which has the antibodies. If you're donating blood or have donated blood before it's as simple as that and you could possibly save a life and help. Dr. Gupta: The process is called convalescent plasma. To help the most people, convalescent plasma would require mass testing to find out who has the necessary antibodies against Covid-19. Dr. Gupta: I want to reiterate that having had Covid-19 once does not definitively mean you are immune. Even if being infected once does give you some amount of immunity, health experts aren't sure how long that will last or how strong it will be.  They are hopeful that antibody testing is one thing that could help get the country back on its feet, but it would have to go hand-in-hand with more diagnostic testing for the virus itself, contact tracing, and increasing hospitals resources.

59,CNN,"CNN obtained this video, which was taken inside one of Alabama's state prisons, and it shows just how dangerous and potentially life-threatening conditions are in the facilities. Across the country, prisons and jails have become hotbeds for coronavirus. And prisoners are fearing for their lives. Today we go inside America's prison system and witness how those who are living and working there are battling the disease. We also talk to criminal reform experts about why convicted criminals are just as important to protect as those outside the prison walls.  I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent. And this is ""Coronavirus, Fact vs. Fiction."" Elijah McDowell: The safety measures that they are taking are very low. Some correctional staff members don't even wear protective face masks at all times or gloves and are still coming into contact with inmates. Dr. Gupta: That's Elijah McDowell, who is incarcerated at Willard-Cybulski Correctional Institution, a level 2 security prison in Connecticut. This is how he describes the conditions there: McDowell: I'm in a dormitory. We're around each other 24/7. I'm housed in a six-man cubicle. Right now, as we're speaking, there's probably a good 80 inmates walking around the dorm. It's very hard for us to practice social distancing. Dr. Gupta: Elijah is in prison for a parole violation and a weapons violation, and he is scheduled to be released by July 1.  McDowell: The majority of the people where I'm housed right now have weeks to months left incarcerated. You're a low-risk offender if you're in this correctional institution to begin with. So, then to still be stuck here is obviously super dangerous for anybody in this predicament right now.  Dr. Gupta: The Connecticut Department of Correction says that as of Monday, 18 inmates in this facility have tested positive for Covid-19. Since April 8, the state has been transferring all infected inmates to an isolation unit in a separate facility, which is in line with their policy.   Additionally, they say they are protecting staff and inmates by canceling social visits and releasing as many prisoners as they can. But Elijah is still worried that the virus is spreading. McDowell: I mean, there was an incident yesterday where  we had an inmate who has chronic asthma, who was coughing, wasn't feeling well, went to medical, came back to the dorm with a fever above 100 degrees. And you can already imagine how we all will react to something like that, including staff members couldn't believe that they were rehousing (an) inmate like that with the population after showing symptoms of possibly being infected with the Covid-19. Dr. Gupta: We asked the Connecticut Department of Correction about Elijah's claims, and they said they were not aware of the incident. Black Americans, like Elijah, who is also Hispanic, are incarcerated at several times the rate of white Americans, and now we're seeing that black Americans are also disproportionately affected by Covid-19.  CNN Political Commentator Van Jones: You know, there's a longstanding sad joke in the black community that says, you know, when white America gets a cold, black America gets the flu. Well, what happens when white America gets a pandemic? Well, you know, we get the plague. Dr. Gupta: That's CNN commentator and criminal justice reform advocate Van Jones. Jones: So, when you know for sure that you've got a population of people in your prisons, African Americans, who have a lot more of the health risk factors to turn this epidemic lethal, you have even more reason to move quickly. Dr. Gupta: Last week, (federal) Bureau of Prisons Director Michael Carvajal told CNN he is preparing now for a worst-case scenario in which 20% of the federal prison population becomes infected. Medical professionals say that prisons and jails can be especially dangerous incubators for infectious diseases.  I spoke to Dr. Zachary Rosner, chief of medicine with the New York City Correctional Health Services. Dr. Zachary Rosner: There are aspects of this virus and the way it interacts with environments that make correctional settings extremely difficult places to both contain spread and also respond to the spread once it's in these settings.  You have people living in very close quarters. You have services that have to be delivered by many different people. You have people going in and out in order to bring food or to bring other services. So, these environments are uniquely vulnerable to a virus like the coronavirus. Dr. Gupta: Dr. Rosner works at Rikers Island, a correctional facility located on an island in New York City's East River, notorious for its violence and poor conditions. The city's Department of Correction says that as of April 12, New York City has about 4,000 inmates in custody, and 319 of them Covid-19. Two have died. Additionally, 573 of about 11,000 staff members have also tested positive for the virus. I asked Dr. Rosner what doctors at Rikers were doing to fight the spread of Covid-19? Dr. Rosner: What has to happen on behalf of people who are in custody is slightly different than it is in the community. So, whereas somebody who's having mild or moderate symptoms of coronavirus in the community will be advised to go home, rest, drink water, take Tylenol if they have a fever, that autonomy is lost in these settings. And that's where the environment requires that correctional authorities and health care teams work very closely together to make sure that people who are sick are separated from people who are not sick, and that the people who are sick are transferred to the hospital, if they need a hospital level of care. And that's essentially the core work that has to happen in any health system that's in a jail or prison nationally right now.  Dr. Gupta: It seems that prisons are sort of like incubators for an infection like this. It's very contagious. You yourself have compared it to the Princess Diamond cruise ship. Is that a good analogy? As you know, a significant percentage of people became infected on that ship.  Dr. Rosner: Unfortunately, I think it's a good analogy. The dynamics in the jail, the number of people that a single person will likely infect, is much higher than in the community. For that reason, there's really just one single public health intervention which can be effective in jails or prisons across the board, and that's to release as many vulnerable people as possible, allow those people to do social distancing safely at home, and allow the health systems in these settings to focus on identifying the sickest people and mitigating the spread of the virus.  Dr. Gupta: The numbers are changing every day, but as of April 6, New York City officials have released over 1,500 people. But prisoner advocate groups, like Reform Alliance, are pushing for more to help the over 2 million people incarcerated in America today. Van Jones is the organization's CEO. Jones: Yeah look, I think a lot of people listening to this might think, ""Well, why do I care about somebody in prison? I can't even figure out how to educate my kids. I can't even figure out how to buy, like, produce or toilet paper."" And I'm gonna tell you: You're gonna care. Because the potential super accelerator of this virus are the jails and prisons across the country. First of all, we're in danger of the jails and prisons becoming morgues from coast to coast. And you have guards and staff coming in and out, bringing the virus in, bringing the virus back out. So, you cannot defeat this plague outside of the prisons if you don't defeat it inside the prisons. But the other thing nobody's thought about is: They will then overflood the hospitals and you then make it hard for everybody to get health care. The smart thing to do is before the virus takes off in a jail or prison to depopulate it safely and quickly. Think what you would do if it were your kid, who had maybe, you know, got caught with marijuana and was sitting in a jail someplace, and you found out that the plague was ripping through there. You would say, ""Get my child out of there. Do something. Save my child's life.""  Dr. Gupta: Reform Alliance is pushing politicians to adopt a new plan called SAFER which aims to protect people living and working inside America's jails and prisons.  We asked Van and Jessica Jackson, an attorney and the chief advocacy officer for Reform Alliance, to explain their SAFER plan. Jessica Jackson: The S stands for suspending visits, probation visits, suspending courts. The A stands for alternatives to incarceration. The F stands for free hygiene items like soap and hand sanitizer. The E stands for extra precautions for the guards and staff who are coming in and out of the facilities. And the R stands for releases, compassionate releases and other releases that are not a risk to public safety.  Jones: You know, get people out, as many people as you possibly can, safely and well. There's a lot of people who could come home and be on home confinement. They can go back later on if they need to, but get them out of there. Dr. Gupta: Van and Jessica say that local, state and federal officials need to start implementing the SAFER plan in prisons and jails before it's too late. Jones: Today, right now, in the age of the virus, any arrest can be a death sentence. Nobody in the United States has ever been sentenced to die in a prison or a jail by a virus. So, let's not forget there's a bunch of people who can be sent home to home confinement right now, and there would be no threat to public safety, but you'd have a great benefit to public health.  Dr. Gupta: Across the country, some authorities are already taking action to release inmates.  News report (CNN): US Attorney General William Barr is ordering prison officials to maximize early release programs for a wide swath of vulnerable inmates.  News report (KCRW): LA County has released about 1,700 inmates with fewer than 30 days left to serve.  News report (KPIX): The Alameda County sheriff's department says they started the early release process on Tuesday. Most of them are nonviolent, low-level offenders. Dr. Gupta: Advocates have been trying to do what they can to help. Some prisoners are suing local governments for release, while some organizations like Reform Alliance are donating medical supplies to prisons. But they need all the help they can get.  Jones: What we want people to do is to say, ""Hey, listen, your governor can do something about this. Your local sheriff can do something about this. The Department of Justice can do something about this."" They've got to hear from us, though. This is a moment for us to realize, ""Hey, we need each other!"" And so, I believe that we are being called upon to find a different storehouse of empathy and love and care. It's not just fear. Yes, fear for, you know, our own families, but also compassion and empathy for other people's families.  Dr. Gupta: Until something is done to address the mounting health crisis in America's jails and prisons, the medical professionals working there remain on the front lines, caring for their patients.  I asked Dr. Rosner at Rikers if he's taking any special precautions when he goes home at the end of the day to try and keep his own family safe: Dr. Rosner: Yes, absolutely. It's a ... sorry, a difficult question, actually, because my wife is also a health care worker and works on labor and delivery in the Bronx. We have actually sent our kids out of town, out to their grandparents. And, you know, we are prepared right now to make personal sacrifices to try to help our colleagues and our patients get through this difficult time. Dr. Gupta: Just because someone is incarcerated does not mean that person's health and life are expendable. As Van Jones said earlier, we cannot allow our fear of this pandemic to undermine our empathy for one another.  Don't forget, we're all in this together.

60,CNN,"During the task force briefing, the White House presented a digital montage of TV and radio clips of Trump's early actions with the coronavirus. One clip featured audio from New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman, who can be heard describing how the President was criticized for his early travel ban from China. Facts First: The Haberman quotes are misleading as they edit out one of her key points: that the President's travel restriction was one of the last actions he took to address the coronavirus for weeks. Here's the Haberman quote as it was presented by the White House video: ""As there were more cases and it was clear that it was spreading out of China -- where it originated -- the President took this move that he was widely criticized for by Democrats and even some Republicans at the time. Which was he halted a number of flights from China into the U.S. The idea was to halt the spread of the disease, keep transmissions to a minimum. He was accused of xenophobia. He was accused of making a racist move. At the end of the day, it was probably effective, because it did actually take a pretty aggressive measure against the spread of the virus."" According to a transcript of The Daily podcast from March 25, here's the end of the quote, including a key point (in bold) at the end that was left out of the White House presentation: ""At the end of the day, it was probably effective, because it did actually take a pretty aggressive measure against the spread of the virus. The problem is, it was one of the last things that he did for several weeks.""  According to the transcript, the Daily's host Michael Barbaro asked a follow up question: ""So the right decision in retrospect, but not accompanied by similar actions that might have contained transmission."" Haberman responded: ""That's exactly right. In the same way that George W. Bush was criticized for his 'Mission Accomplished' banner about Iraq, the President treated that moment as if it was his mission accomplished moment. He did not do anything after that in terms of alerting the public, or telling people to be safe, or telling people to take precautions. And it basically squandered several weeks within the US."" As Haberman pointed out on Twitter, she went on to say that the President ""treated that travel limitation as a Mission Accomplished moment,"" harkening back to former President George W. Bush. Joe Biden and the travel restrictions on China  Trump claimed that presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has apologized for having accused him of xenophobia on January 31, when Trump's administration announced its coronavirus travel restrictions on China. ""He has since apologized and he said I did the right thing,"" Trump said. Facts First: Biden has not apologized for having called Trump xenophobic. Furthermore, it's not clear the former vice president even knew about Trump's China travel restrictions when he called him xenophobic on the day the restrictions were unveiled.  Biden's campaign announced in early April that he supports Trump's travel restrictions on China, so part of Trump's Monday claim is correct. But the Biden campaign did not say the former vice president had previously been wrong about the ban, much less apologize. Rather, the campaign says Biden's January 31 accusations -- that Trump has a record of ""hysterical xenophobia"" and ""fear mongering"" -- were not about the travel restrictions at all.  The campaign says Biden did not know about the restrictions at the time of his speech, since his campaign event in Iowa started shortly after the Trump administration briefing where the restrictions were revealed by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. Given the timing of the Biden remarks, it's not unreasonable for the Trump campaign to infer that the former vice president was talking about the travel restrictions. But Biden never took an explicit position on the restrictions until his April declaration of support -- and whether or not you accept his campaign's argument that the ""xenophobia"" claim was not about the restrictions, he certainly hasn't apologized for the accusation. Coronavirus testing At Monday's briefing, Trump implied that he had inherited flawed coronavirus tests from President Barack Obama's administration. ""We literally rebuilt tests -- we rebuilt a whole industry because we inherited nothing,"" Trump said. ""What we inherited from the previous administration was totally broken, which somebody should eventually say. Not only were the cupboards bare, as I say, but we inherited broken testing. Now we have great testing."" Facts First: Since this is a new virus that was first identified this year, the tests for it are newly created, not inherited from the Obama administration. The faulty initial test for the coronavirus was created during Trump's administration, in early 2020, by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The claim ""doesn't make sense because it is false,"" Tara Smith, an epidemiology professor at Kent State University, said of a previous version of Trump's claim. ""This a new virus."" ""He is lying. He is lying 100%. He is lying because he is trying to shift blame to others, even if the attempt is totally nonsensical,"" Gregg Gonsalves, an assistant professor in the Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases at the Yale School of Public Health, said of a previous version of the claim. Trump has made versions of this claim on multiple occasions, shifting his rhetoric over time from a broader and more debatable claim that the testing ""system"" was flawed. While his Monday claim about having inherited ""broken testing"" is slightly vaguer than his claims about having inherited faulty or obsolete ""tests,"" it creates the same impression. You can read more here about the President's various claims on inheriting tests.   President has 'total' authority over coronavirus restrictions Trump falsely claimed on Monday that, as President, he has ""total"" authority to decide to lift restrictions governors have imposed to fight the coronavirus pandemic. ""When somebody's the President of the United States, the authority is total, and that's the way it's got to be,"" Trump said at the White House coronavirus briefing. Trump then said: ""The authority of the President of the United States having to do with the subject we're talking about is total."" And after speaking about local governments, he said, ""They can't do anything without the approval of the President of the United States.""  It wasn't clear if he was referring to state or local officials with that assertion. But he was wrong regardless. Facts First: The President does not have ""total"" authority over coronavirus restrictions. Without seeking or requiring Trump's permission, governors, mayors and school district officials imposed the restrictions that have kept citizens at home and shut down schools and businesses, and it's those same officials who have the power to decide when to lift those restrictions. There is no legislation that explicitly gives the President the power to override states' public health measures. In addition, Trump said last week that he prefers, because of the Constitution, to let governors make their own decisions on coronavirus restrictions. We can't say for sure that the courts would not side with Trump if he attempted to challenge state restrictions on some constitutional grounds he has not yet identified. However, many legal scholars believe Trump would lose. James Hodge, a professor and director of the Center for Public Health Law and Policy at Arizona State University, said Trump is ""wrong"" to claim he has the power to lift the states' coronavirus restrictions.  ""He can strongly encourage, advise, or even litigate whether states' authorities to restrict public movements re: shelter in place or stay home orders are warranted, but cannot tell sovereign governors to lift these orders all at once just because the federal government determines it is high time to do so,"" Hodge said in an email. Trump's Monday evening comments at the briefing echoed tweets from earlier in the day in which he asserted that ""it is the decision of the President,"" not governors, on when to ""open up the states.""  ""This tweet is just false. The President has no formal legal authority to categorically override local or state shelter-in-place orders or to reopen schools and small businesses. No statute delegates to him such power; no constitutional provision invests him with such authority,"" Stephen Vladeck, a University of Texas law professor and CNN legal analyst, said on Twitter on Monday.  Trump did not personally shut down the economy. Rather, he issued nonbinding guidelines on how people should keep their distance from each other. The guidelines begin as follows: ""Listen to and follow the directions of your STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES."" No legislation says the President has the power to overturn the public health decisions of these authorities, Vladeck and other legal scholars say.  Trump did not explain why he believes he has this power. When CNN's Kaitlan Collins asked him who told him he has ""total"" authority, he did not answer directly, instead saying, ""We're going to write up papers on this.""  When another reporter explained that the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution grants to states the powers not delegated to the federal government, Trump did not contest this interpretation -- and instead sidestepped the question, saying he did not believe a state official who refused to reopen the economy could win reelection.  Trump-friendly website Breitbart broached the possibility that Trump could try to use the Constitution's Commerce Clause, which gives Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce, to try to lift commercial restrictions.   Robert Barnes, a lawyer who supports Trump, argued to CNN on Monday that, ""in the emergency context,"" the President possesses these commerce powers the Constitution assigns to Congress. Vladeck said Barnes' claim is unfounded. While Vladeck said Congress might be able to pass a law authorizing the President to override some state and local restrictions -- he emphasized the ""might"" -- he said Trump does not have the power to override the restrictions on his own. ""Congress has delegated the President a bunch of powers for emergencies, but this isn't among them,"" Vladeck told CNN. Hodge said states have a long-established authority to restrict some commerce for the protection of public health. And it is widely understood that state governments have the power to address public health emergencies within their states.  In a 2014 report, the Congressional Research Service, which provides nonpartisan research and analysis to Congress, looked at federal and state powers over quarantine and isolation. The report did not specifically address the question of a president wanting to override state public health measures, but it noted: ""In general, courts appear to have declined to interfere with a state's exercise of police powers with regard to public health matters 'except where the regulations adopted for the protection of the public health are arbitrary, oppressive and unreasonable.'"" While both the Congressional Research Service report and the National Conference of State Legislatures say that the federal government can ""take over"" the management of a public health incident within a state ""if the federal government determines local efforts are inadequate,"" they do not specifically address a situation in which the federal government wants to take over because it believes the state is being too strict in trying to address the emergency. Trump has some power Trump himself has spoken as recently as last week about states' constitutional powers during the pandemic, though he has asserted that he too has powers. After he was asked on April 10 about the possibility of Florida's governor opening up schools in May, the President said: ""I like to allow governors to make decisions without overruling them, because from a constitutional standpoint, that's the way it should be done. If I disagreed, I would overrule a governor, and I have that right to do it. But I'd rather have them -- you can call it 'federalist,' you can call it 'the Constitution,' but I call it 'the Constitution.' I would rather have them make their decisions.""  Trump does have some clear, though limited, direct power. For example, he can order federal employees to return to their offices and reopen national parks and other federal property. And he can, obviously, use his influence to try to persuade governors -- and citizens -- to do as he wishes. It is also possible that Trump could try to leverage the ""major disaster declaration"" he has issued for each state -- for example, attempting to require governors to take certain steps in exchange for federal assistance. Hodge, though, said it ""could be unconstitutional"" to try to impose new conditions for the receipt of federal funding after having already authorized the disaster declarations without such conditions. Trump also asserted at the briefing that even Democratic governors would agree with his claim to total authority. New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, speaking shortly after the briefing to CNN's Erin Burnett, said he disagreed: ""We have a Constitution. We don't have a king.""  Fact checking Trump's claims about his travel restrictions on Europe, China Responding to criticism of his administration's response to the coronavirus, Trump touted his decision to limit travel from areas which had more coronavirus cases than the US at the time.  Trump told reporters Monday, ""I did a ban on China, you think that was easy? Then I did a ban on Europe and many said it was an incredible thing to do.""  Asked later about whether he'd be willing to lift travel restrictions as part of opening up the country, Trump added, ""Right now we have a very strong ban. We will keep it that way until they heal."" Facts First: It's misleading to call the travel restrictions Trump announced against China and Europe a ban because they contained multiple exemptions. Only foreign nationals who had been in China, Europe's Schengen area, the UK or Ireland within the past 14 days are outright banned from entering the US. As of February 2, US citizens who had been in China's Hubei province in the two weeks prior to their return to the United States are subject to a mandatory quarantine of up to 14 days upon their return to the US. American citizens returning from the rest of mainland China may also face up to 14 days of quarantine after undergoing health screenings at selected ports of entry. The broader European travel suspension Trump announced on March 11 applied to the 26 countries in the Schengen Area, a European zone in which people can move freely across internal borders without being subjected to border checks. While Trump initially identified the United Kingdom as exempt, additional countries that are not in the Schengen Area and thus also exempt from the restrictions include Ireland, Croatia, Cyprus, Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Serbia, Armenia, Montenegro, Belarus and Russia. As of March 14, the ban was expanded to include foreign nationals traveling from UK and Ireland. The restrictions also did not apply to US citizens returning from Europe as well as permanent US residents and certain family members of both citizens and permanent residents. You can read more about the European travel restrictions here. Governors have what they need  Trump asserted on several occasions during Monday's briefing that governors across the country are satisfied with his administration's efforts to get states supplies and hospital capacity they need to handle coronavirus patients.  Facts First: Trump's assertions ignore the fact that some governors have said this week that they still need medical equipment and are struggling with hospital bed capacity. Toward the start of the briefing, the President aired a montage of video clips attempting to frame his administration's response to the coronavirus in a positive light. The montage highlighted clips of numerous governors, both Democrats and Republicans, thanking the President for his administration's assistance.  During the briefing, the President claimed that ""no one who has needed a ventilator has not gotten a ventilator."" ""If you look, they were all saying, 'We need ventilators,' ... you don't hear ventilators anymore. They have all the ventilators they need. Which we were right about. We said you're asking for too many, you don't need that,"" Trump said. In the briefing, Trump also claimed, ""No one who has needed a hospital bed has not gotten a hospital bed."" Yet two of the governors included in the montage, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, just one day prior said that both of their states need more equipment.   ""I think to say that everybody's completely happy and that we have everything we need is -- is not quite accurate,"" Hogan told ABC's ""This Week"" on Sunday. ""I mean everybody still has tremendous needs on personal protective equipment and ventilators and all of these things that you keep hearing about. Everybody's fighting to find these things all over the -- all over the nation and all over the world."" Murphy said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that New Jersey does not have enough supplies to do ""universal testing,"" which is a goal and the state is currently ""testing only for symptomatic patients."" Murphy has also said his state is struggling to stay ahead of hospital bed capacity. ""We're fighting to stay ahead on bed capacity, ventilators that are constantly running thin, the medicine you need for those ventilators, the personal protective equipment, and the relief from the bullpen for our health care workers,"" he added."
61,CNN,Thank you for using CNN 10
62,CNN,"I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, and this is ""Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction."" Christine Romans: Thanks, Sanjay. Stimulus checks Romans: You know, one of the questions I've been getting a lot, not just from viewers but also from my friends and family, is about the government's big stimulus plan, its rescue of Main Street. You probably heard about those $1,200 checks that they're going to be giving out within the next couple of weeks. So let's walk through what you need to know about the plan. So it's $1,200 for most Americans earning less than $75,000 a year. It's a one-time payment. It will be direct deposited in your bank account if you file tax returns electronically in 2018 or 2019. Or if you collect Social Security, they have your bank information. They'll deposit the check directly. If you haven't filed tax returns in the past couple of years, you might have to wait for a paper check. And that could take a little bit longer.  Also in this stimulus are expanded jobless benefits. States are handing out an extra $600 a week if you find yourself out of work. And that's going to continue for up to four months. And for the first time, gig economy workers and the self-employed are included. And the states are working out how they will count them and make sure they get jobless benefits as well.  Small business loans Romans: All right, next, we have been getting questions from concerned small business owners about the resources that the government is giving them to help. And a lot of concerns about how hard it has been to get those loans.  So what's in this? Well, nearly $350 billion has been allocated for small business owners. Now the Small Business Administration and the banks are working out how best to get it to people. But it is there. The promise is there.  It's been slow to connect small businesses with that money, but Congress is basically saying more money is coming. This is a cornerstone of the Main Street bailout.  Who is eligible? Any small business with 500 or fewer employees. The goal is to get the money to you so you can pay for your labor and overhead. And the labor is a really big part of that. You don't have to pay back this loan. It is free money if you use at least 75% of the loan to pay your workers, to keep your workers and the rest then on utilities and rent. Retirees and students Romans: What about for retirees and students? Well, really important information if you're retired. The required minimum distributions are waived for 2020. That means seniors don't have to take money out of their retirement accounts and take the loss. This has been a bad year in the stock market. If you're forced to take money out of your stock accounts, because by law, you have to do that, you could take a loss. So, seniors don't have to do that for this year.  Also, anybody under 59 years old, you can withdraw up to $100,000 from your IRA or your 401k accounts without a penalty. You have to show that you're in distress because of the coronavirus pandemic.  Now, that's a fast way to get money. But look, this should be your last resort. Tapping into your retirement is a sign of real distress. And most studies show that if you do that, you end up further behind when it's time for you to retire. So, do that as a last resort. For student loan borrowers, look, you get a break here. Repayment and interest on all federally backed student loans have been suspended for six months until September 30th. And the Department of Education cannot collect on any defaulted loans by garnishing your wages or by taking your tax refund. That's an important change. Rent and mortgage Romans: All right. Another question I've been getting is what do I do if I can't pay my rent or mortgage?  Well, you know, nearly a third of Americans didn't pay their rent in April. That's according to brand new data out last week from the National Multi-family Housing Council. But the government's $2 trillion stimulus bill is giving renters in federally subsidized affordable housing a 120-day moratorium on evictions and late fees so they can't kick you out there.  But most rental properties are owned by private landlords. So you aren't eligible there. That means you've got to talk to your landlord right away and figure out a plan.  Some states like California and Alabama, New York, they're suspending evictions for the time being. So if you can't pay your rent right now, at least you won't be evicted. Ultimately you need to talk to your landlord about your financial situation. Also for homeowners, talk to your lender. Some lenders are giving you a three-month grace period -- a forbearance. But be careful. That means on July 1st four months mortgages are due and you might not have the money at that time. So be very, very careful about pushing off those bills if you can afford to pay them now.  When does this end and how bad will it get? Romans: So a lot of us wish we had a crystal ball and could just know when this was going to be over and how bad it's going to get.  Well, the United States is already in a recession and will probably remain that way for the first half of the year. Now, that's according to a survey out from the National Association for Business Economics. The 45 economists there predict a sharp, short recession for the first half of the year. And they say the coronavirus pandemic will severely restrict economic activity. No question you see that in the long unemployment lines. Those are the two big indicators to watch, right? The unemployment lines and the stock market.  So, 16.8 million Americans have lost their jobs and filed for unemployment benefits in just the past three weeks. I mean, we could be at 10% unemployment right now. So as for the stock market, the S&P 500 has had a really rough spring, the worst month since 2008 in March. But then last week, some good news of sorts. Stocks ended higher in the short week and the S&P 500 had its best week since 1974. You know, where the crisis goes from here, it's frankly unpredictable and volatility for investors is certainly here to stay. So what does that mean for your investments? I mean, where should you be putting your money?  The advice from a lot of the top money managers is just to stay the course. All of them say now is a good time to simply reassess your goals. What is your investing strategy? Don't panic. Don't rush into bonds or cash. For most investors, especially young ones, stocks are going to give you the best chance of solid returns over the long haul. All right, so finally, a lot of listeners want to know when the downturn will end and what the recovery will look like.  You know, that's just hard to say. We've never had a recession like this. We've never had a crisis like this. It's uncharted territory. And while many of us might not be able to sort of see the light at the end of the tunnel quite yet, if we all do our parts, things will turn around sooner rather than later. Dr. Gupta: Christine, thank you so much. I learned a lot, as I always do from you.  And I know most of us are eager to get back to work and look forward to businesses opening again to re-start the economy. But right now, nothing is more important than the health and safety of all Americans and the last thing any of us want is a second wave of the coronavirus infection. So let's please all do our part to contain this pandemic and put our economy back on track.  And if you have more questions, please record them as a voice memo and email them to asksanjay@cnn.com -- we'd like to include them in one of our podcasts.   We'll be back tomorrow.

63,CNN,"Oil producers are desperately seeking to boost prices after Saudi Arabia and Russia abandoned years of production cuts in early March, launching a price war by flooding the market with crude. A massive drop in demand for energy caused by the coronavirus pandemic pushed prices even lower. On Friday, there were signs the group was moving toward consensus.  Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador told reporters that he had discussed the issue with US President Donald Trump, and agreed to cut production by 100,000 barrels per day, which is far less than the 400,000 barrels per day other producers had sought on Thursday. According to López Obrador, Trump offered during the phone call to cut US production by 250,000 barrels per day to compensate for Mexico. Trump confirmed Friday that the US agreed to a cut in order to pick up some of the slack after he spoke with López Obrador. Even if producers cut output by 10 million barrels per day, the decline in production would amount to only about 10% of the world's normal supply of oil, far below the estimates for how much demand for oil has collapsed in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. And it is unlikely to stem the massive plunge in oil prices in recent months. A hemorrhaging industry Thursday's meeting began with Barkindo sounding the alarm about both oil prices and demand. He told attendees that projections call for demand of nearly 12 million fewer barrels per day in the current quarter. ""These are staggering numbers! Unprecedented in modern times,"" he said. At that rate, ""Given the current unprecedented supply and demand imbalance there could be a colossal excess volume of 14.7 million barrels a day in the second quarter of 2020,"" he said. Even those dire forecasts may be too optimistic, as they could underestimate how much demand has fallen with harsh restrictions on travel, work and public life now in place in much of the world because of the pandemic. Tom Kloza, the chief oil analyst for the Oil Price Information Service, said he believes demand is down as much as 20 million barrels a day. ""This cut is woefully inadequate to stabilize prices into at least the summer,"" he said. The tentative agreement negotiated Thursday would see the output reduced to 8 million barrels a day from July to December followed by a 6 million barrels a day reduction from January 2021 to April 2022. ​ Iran, Libya and Venezuela would be exempted from the output cuts due to sanctions or lost production. Oil futures had started Thursday higher on reports that there would be an agreement to cut up to 15 million barrels a day. As the day wore on, though, doubts emerged that the cut would be that large and prices closed slightly lower. Hopes for a deal Thursday's emergency meeting, which was called by Saudi Arabia, followed pressure by Trump, who last week called on Saudi Arabia and Russia to deliver big production cuts.  Trump said he spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin and King Salman of Saudi Arabia Thursday to discuss oil production. Dozens of US oil companies are facing bankruptcy due to the collapse in oil prices and Trump said that he anticipates worldwide layoffs in the oil industry. ""The numbers are so low that there will be layoffs all over the world, there will be certainly layoffs in this country and we don't want that to happen,"" he said. Trump said he hopes there will be a deal worked out to cut oil production. ""We'll see what happens but as you know OPEC met today and I would say they are getting close to a deal,"" said Trump. -- CNN's Claudia Dominguez, Natalie Gallón, Jason Hoffman, Chris Liakos and Mostafa Salem contributed to this report."

65,CNN,"You read that right. Amid a global pandemic and tens of thousands of infected and dead Americans, the President is upset that journalists are not asking questions in a positive way and are instead asking him challenging questions, questions he clearly does not want to answer, questions that he does not want you to think about, such as the April 6 HHS inspector general report that surveyed 323 US hospitals that lacked enough testing equipment, to say nothing of PPE, masks, ICU beds, or more, asked about by FOX News' Kristin Fisher. ""I know you don't want to talk about the inspector general report, but testing is still a big issue in this country,"" Fisher said. ""We're the federal government. We're not supposed to stand on street corners doing testing,"" Trump said on Monday. ""You should say, 'Congratulations, great job,' instead of being so horrid in the way you ask a question."" There's nothing horrid about the question. Mr. President, on March 6, you visited the CDC, and you said anyone who wants a test can get a test. That was not true then. It remains untrue today. Any responsible path out of this situation requires much more widespread testing than the US is doing right now. What is the plan to ramp it up even more, sir? How many more Americans will be tested? And by when? Then there's this question from CBS' Weijia Jiang. ""Yesterday Jared Kushner said the notion of the federal stockpile was it's supposed to be our stockpile. It's not supposed to be state stockpiles that they then use. What did he mean by 'our'?"" Jiang said.  The President responded by calling that a gotcha question. It's not. And saying that the reporter should be ashamed of herself. She shouldn't. But, Mr. President, the American people want to know, what responsibility do you believe the federal government has when it comes to aiding states with supplies from the federal stockpile? Colorado's Democratic governor said that FEMA had swooped in and grabbed ventilators that his state was trying to get, and then days later, you announced that you were giving ventilators to Colorado because of the efforts of a vulnerable Republican senator from that state. What do you and Jared Kushner mean when you say ""our"" stockpile? What is the plan with the stockpile? Then there's this question from McClatchy's Francesca Chambers. ""The Paycheck Protection Program has got off to a confusing start for some small businesses --,"" Chambers said.  ""I don't think so,"" Trump said.  Trump interrupted to disagree and criticized Chambers for not asking him a -- quote -- ""positive question,"" about how the program had gotten off to a -- quote -- ""tremendous start."" Look, Mr. President, everyone wants this program to work, but the fact remains, that there are issues with the Paycheck Protection Program. How are those kinks being fixed? What is the plan? Attacking journalists who ask questions does not make those questions go away. It only reveals that you might not have the answers. Again, sir, respectfully, what is the plan for a way out of this? Do you have one?"
66,CNN,"So in this episode, I invited Rev. Jennifer Bailey to talk about how faith leaders are leading their communities. And to help us answer this question: Does your faith change in a pandemic? I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent. This is ""Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction."" Gupta: Rev. Bailey is an associate minister for the Greater Bethel AME Church in Nashville, Tennessee. She founded an organization called the Faith Matters Network, and is ordained in the African Methodist Episcopal Church.   Gupta: Reverend Bailey, thank you so much for joining us. I want to talk a little bit about what's been going on in the world. What has your life been like with Covid-19? Rev. Jennifer Bailey: One of the things that I've been trained up in as a clergy person is accompanying people through the best and worst moments of their lives. And in this season, where we're not able to physically be present with one another in the same ways, figuring out new ways to be present.  I'm a millennial. And so figuring out that my phone can be used for something other than email or texting has been a revelation for me. So, picking up the phone and having weekly calls with my grandma and others has been a really beautiful invitation back into connection and community for me. Gupta: What do you tell people, for example, your friends, who may call you and they're leaning on you. How do you approach those conversations? Bailey: As I have been offering pastoral care and support for friends, I think the first thing that I offer them is the affirmation that they are doing the best they can. I also tell them that it's okay to be angry at God.  If my God's not big enough to hold my questions or hold my anger in this season, I don't know if I have much use for that God -- and I say that as a clergy woman, right, who very much believes that God is real. And so I think there is a tendency sometimes to pivot towards this sort of blind optimism or theology that is more akin to positive psychology than it is true, true theology in my own mind's eyes, and that there's a distinction between blind optimism and hope. And that hope is, at least in the Christian faith of which I'm a part of, born out of a suffering.  I find great hope in my ancestors, both in my tradition and in, you know, as someone who's African American, seeing the ways in which the church mothers of my church have made a way out of no way for a long time and find solace in that.   Gupta: That's beautiful. It is a month of significant religious tradition: Easter and Passover. Ramadan is later this month as well. Typically, you know, people think about these traditions as being gatherings of people coming together -- families, friends connecting. Real human touch. And at the same time, given this pandemic that we're all, everyone in the world, is living under, that is not advised at this point to come together. How do you approach that then? Because that connection is such a part of the tradition. Is something going be lost because of that? Bailey: I think the first thing that we do is acknowledge and lament the fact that we can't be together, right? That that is an important part of any ritual practices that are happening in the season. I'm also an odd duck who is a Christian clergy person that's married to a practicing Jew.  And so ... last night we had a virtual Seder with my husband's family, and it was imperfect. You know, his parents had some issues adjusting the iPads to get the angle right and the sound right.   And there was laughter, right, as we were saying the blessings and we're telling the Passover story. There was laughter through the imperfection. And so I think that there is a beautiful way in which even as we adapt these traditions to be virtual, or for the first time, maybe folks are experiencing some of these things alone, that there is space for joy. There is a distinction between joy and happiness, like you can put the word ""un"" in front of happiness and it means something very different, but you can't say ""unjoy"" and so that there is something revolutionary about joy, even in the mess of Zoom Seders that don't go perfectly well. Even as we lament in this season, the inability to be able to touch hands or see one another in person or give each other hugs or laugh around the same Seder table, I think there are also these opportunities for great joy -- these opportunities to innovate and think about how community can look different in the 21st century. Gupta: Let me let me ask you about the multiple faiths that exist within your household because I deal with the same thing. Can you just talk about that? Bailey: So I am married to my beloved husband, Ira, who has grown up and is generationally Jewish and practicing. So it's been a real journey walking with him in both a multi-faith and interracial relationship. We live in the South. So you know, we got a lot going on in our household.  You know, I think, in many ways I was built for this. My first week of high school was 9/11, and I got involved in interfaith work when I was 16 years old. And so, I saw that the great religious traditions of the world could be a force for real devastation, or they could be a force for good.  Gupta: As you know, there are governors around the country, and including in the South, where you live, who are mostly abiding by the stay-at-home, sort of, recommendations but have made exceptions for religious gatherings. I'm just wondering what you think of that. Is that a reasonable exception to make or would you do the same thing? Bailey: I understand the desire and impulse of folks when things are going wrong in the world to go to our religious spaces, to be present with our religious communities. And my grandma taught me not to be foolish.   From my perspective, the truly faithful thing to do, the most loving thing that we could do, is stay home, so that we might care for those who do have compromised immune systems, care for those who are vulnerable because of their age, care for those who are pregnant, right? And so, I personally, very strongly disagree with those who are choosing to gather, particularly over 10 people, in spaces.  We know that some of these outbreaks started in religious communities, right?  Our churches will be there, God willing, on the other end of this, and that perhaps the most faithful action that we can take during this season is to be physically distanced from one another, but not socially distanced from one another.  Gupta: And I think it is worth reminding people, there will be another side of this. This isn't forever. I think science, public health officials all agree on that. We don't know when that will be. But there is a tunnel and we can see the light.  Something I thought that was interesting that Dr. Fauci said, though, even though we will get back to some sense of normalcy, what he actually thinks maybe even shouldn't change is things like hand-shaking, because even outside of a pandemic, there are other pathogens --  flu virus, things like that which still takes significant toll on societies. I've wondered what you thought of that, Reverend. Do you think that should or would become a new normal? Bailey: Not with my folks. I come from a community of huggers. I come from a community that passes the peace by shaking hands, right.  Gupta: So do I. Bailey: So you know, I think we are, we are longing for that physical touch again. We might, for those first couple of weeks or months as we're adjusting back, think of alternative ways. I don't know if it's a fist bump for Jesus or whatever we might need to do initially. My sense is that as things become clear, as the picture becomes clear, that we will certainly move back. And we know that touch has a healing power as well, right? That there is something about physical touch that is deeply, not just soothing, but that -- you're the scientist, Doctor, I think that there have been studies that physical touch can actually help heal people, right? That that closeness can be a thing that is positive to folks. Gupta: You're right. They talk of it as the 'laying on of hands.' You know, that's one of the, I think, convergence points, Reverend, dare I say, between your world and my world.  One of the things we've seen as well is that this pandemic has not affected people equally. Even though it's a virus that doesn't discriminate, how it's impacted black America -- the data coming out of these states, was tragic.  In Michigan, where I'm from originally, 41% of the people who have died from Covid-19 have been black. Fourteen percent of the state's population is black. As a leader in a historically black church, how do you and your community of people, do you talk about this? How do you deal with this? Bailey: For my community, I think we know that health disparities disproportionately impact black and brown folks. We know that many of the jobs that we've now discovered are essential are jobs that are, (and)  have historically been, viewed as working-class positions, (and) are in many cities and states and places inhabited by black and brown folks and low-income folks. And so, it has been devastating, but if not unsurprising, to me. I think, in my more cynical and less gracious moments -- and I try really hard not to be cynical and ungracious -- I think when we were finally starting to get the aggregated data, it only affirmed what I knew and was seeing as somebody who's originally from Chicago, and hearing reports from back home about who was passing away. And at the same time, I've seen an outpouring in the black community of which I'm a part of, of folks really caring for one another and spreading correct information around mutual aid and health and safety and how we ought protect one another in this moment.  And so I do think that there are lights at the end of this tunnel.  Gupta: I imagine you would hate the question: has your faith been challenged by what's going on right now? Because it seems to me that inherent in the word faith is that it's not really challenged. It's there. But has it changed?  Bailey: In this season, as we face a global pandemic, as we face just this season of uncertainty in terms of knowing where we're going, the one thing that I hold onto is that nothing can separate us from the love of God. My God is big enough to hold my anger, my God is big enough to hold my unbelief, even as I believe. And so, you know, I think in this season for myself, I have found myself leaning deeper into the old school rituals and practices of my tradition. I've sang more hymns than I've ever sang in my life. I don't see myself as somebody who is necessarily enthralled with hymns. And I think in a time where everything is urgent and nothing is urgent, where we're wrestling with figuring out how to deal with these challenges, being able to sing the songs that my great-great grandmother sang, people who survived the horror of Jim and Jane Crow, who survived the horror of slavery, who survived the reality of structural inequality in this country. If it was good enough for them, then I think this faith is good enough for me.  Even as I question, even as I get angry, I know that nothing can separate me from God's love. Gupta: These days, humanity as a whole has suffered great losses -- whether it's the loss of a job, a routine, someone we love.   I've lost people who mean a lot to me in the last few weeks.   Right before my interview with Rev. Bailey, I reported on the death of Charlotte Figi, a little girl who changed the world and my own life.  I first met her back in 2013. She was 6 years old and I was told that she had intractable epilepsy. And that nothing was working for her. She had been having 300 seizures a week. And then her family tried CBD, an ingredient in the cannabis plant. It's a non-intoxicating part of the plant and considered to have some medicinal properties. And yet it was still illegal, and her mom, Paige, had to make the CBD oil in her own kitchen. She gave it to Charlotte and it worked.  It was an amazing story, and it inspired me to search the world and find out if there were other patients like her, and what scientists were saying in other places. And what I found changed my mind. Not only would it be a medical failing to withhold a plant that could help so many people, I started to wonder aloud if it was a moral failing as well. The CBD movement in so many ways is something that everyone knows about now, but if you go back and look at the history, look at the origins, in many ways it started with a little girl. A movement wrapped up in this sweet little girl with a big smile, and an even bigger heart. I spent a lot of time with her while I was filming the documentary series about medical marijuana called ""Weed."" You get really close to people that you cover sometimes. I became close to Charlotte, and I became close to her family. I was devastated to learn that she'd passed away.  I asked Reverend Bailey about loss, and if she had any advice on how to come to terms with it, especially at this time.  Bailey: We want to take a breath together or just hold some silence for Charlotte's life.  Gupta: So we, you know, we got really close. And I have three daughters, and they all kind of felt like they knew -- felt like they grew up with Charlotte. So then you know, she got pneumonia. They don't know if it was ... this novel coronavirus or not. Everybody in the family got it. She didn't actually, it never got confirmed. They'd actually gotten her home, they thought she had turned the corner, and then they had to rush her back into the hospital. And, you know, she passed away. It's just a lot, Reverend, you know. I mean, it's, I think everyone is feeling tremendous loss. Bailey: Yeah. It sounds like she was a really incredible young lady and I've already lit a candle on my altar behind me.  Gupta: Thank you, Reverend. You know, I found that as I walk around my house, I have these objects of strength that I just put around there sometimes -- silly objects I don't even know at the time why I decided to put it there. It could be a little memento that I picked up somewhere, It could be a mug that for some reason had meaning to me. And I find my hand sort of lingering on these objects longer than before. I felt like I never had time to really appreciate these touchstones in my life. And now with all that's going on, in part because I'm home-bound like everybody else, but also in part because I think we're all drawing on sources of strength through this time, I think in ways that maybe we hadn't allowed ourselves to do before. And I found it very, very powerful.  I have been dealing with some loss. We all have, I think, in one form or another. Everybody who's listening probably has. They've lost either someone or they've lost a way of life or they've lost something that they consider meaningful. And I'm wondering if you could just leave us with anything that you think you would like our listeners to take away from you and from this conversation? Bailey: I guess I would say that grief is a natural part of this journey, that we're all collectively on together. Acknowledging it, speaking it, naming it, whether that loss be the loss of a loved one or to my high school seniors out there, the dream of prom, right, the loss of something that we were anticipating or have been moving towards, for a long time. And that the gift of grief is that it opens us up to greater feeling, to a greater sense of what's really going on for us. And when we are reminded of those deeper, more vulnerable feelings, we're reminded that we are deeply human. And as being deeply human, we are connected to other humans in the world and that we're not alone. I'd also say that when things feel overwhelming, when things feel like we don't know which way to turn in this season, my invitation to so many is to take a deep breath. For this is a disease that is literally trying to steal our breath. And to be reminded of that breath is to again be reminded that we are human and that we are surviving. Gupta: Reverend, thank you. And I hope to meet you in person and - your people, my people like to give hugs. So I will not hold back if I see you. Bailey: Yes. Yes. Speaking it into the universe. Let's make it happen. Gupta: Continue to be such a good source of strength for people. We need you. Thank you, Reverend.  Bailey: Yeah, thank you. Gupta: It seems now more than ever, it's important to hold on to faith -- whether it's in God or in each other. Remember that we all share a connection that's beyond anything virtual.  Faith is the belief that there's something greater than us. And in this case I think that no one is alone -- that no matter how bleak things might get, we're all facing this together. I hope you remember that, and find some peace in it. We'll be back Monday. Thanks for listening.

68,CNN,"I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent. And this is ""Coronavirus, Fact vs. Fiction.""   Dr. Jerome Adams, US Surgeon General (on ""CBS This Morning""): Blacks are more likely to have diabetes, heart disease, lung disease and I shared myself personally that I have high blood pressure, that I have heart disease and I and many black Americans are at higher risk for Covid.    Gupta: That's the US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams talking to CBS.  On Tuesday, he sounded the alarm about the racial disparity in deaths as a result of Covid-19 -- and how underlying health issues play into it.   The federal government has not yet tracked coronavirus by demographic groups, but what we are seeing from some states is pretty shocking.   In Michigan, where I grew up, 14% of the population is black, yet they make up 41% of coronavirus deaths.   In Illinois, 15% identify as black or African American, but they make up 43% of deaths. A similar pattern is emerging in Louisiana. CNN Political Commentator Van Jones: The African American community is about to get decimated by this virus and it's time for start talking about it in those terms.   Gupta: That's criminal justice reform advocate and CNN commentator Van Jones.    He outlined some of the other issues that make black America more vulnerable, starting with the fact that they are disproportionately low-income.  Jones: The thing about being poor is it's hard to get away from people. Rich people are already socially isolated. They got gated communities. They got mansions. Part of being poor is you've got a bunch of people around you you can't get away from.   This virus actually is ultra-lethal for black communities because it is an epidemic jumping on top of other epidemics. So, you already have an epidemic of hypertension, high blood pressure in the black community. All the doctors are saying: people who have high blood pressure and hypertension are very at risk to dying when they get this virus. Nobody is saying that to the black community loudly enough.   You know, older people or people who have other factors, co-morbidities or whatever they say. Nobody knows what that means. What that means is if your grandmother has high blood pressure or diabetes, grab her and pull her into the house and do not let her out for two months. That level of urgency and specificity has been missing.    Gupta: There's also been a lot of misinformation. Jones: Literally a rumor started in the black community that we are immune to this virus. ""This is a virus that kills old white people."" And the only thing that spread faster than the virus was this rumor. And so you now have tens of millions of black people who have heard, ""Eh, this is really not our issue."" And in fact, nothing could be further from the truth.    Gupta: Van says he's particularly worried about the South where the majority of America's black community lives.   Jones: My sister, who lives in Tennessee, could not get her employer to let her stay home from work, even though she has a ton of health issues that would make this virus almost immediately fatal to her. The employer said, listen, if the mayor is not telling you to stay home and the governor is not telling you stay home, who am I to tell you to stay home, come to work. My sister finally got permission on Thursday of last week to work from home. This is happening to African Americans across the South and to white people across the south as well. But the black community has special underlying epidemic of health problems that make this virus lethal to us. And yet we live in states where governors are the most delinquent. It's been shown in study after study that people reporting the same symptoms, if it's a black person versus a white person, doctors tend to take black pain less seriously. And that on top of the fact that you've got this virus coming through without us taking proper precautions and our underlying health means we're headed for a disaster.  Gupta: Van's concerns are well founded.   There's no doubt this virus has brought into even greater focus the structural inequalities in our health care system which puts certain communities at greater risk.   Michigan lawmaker Tyrone Carter -- who contracted the virus himself -- explained why on CNN.  State Rep. Tyrone Carter: When we talk about health care, it's easy to say that it's accessible, but to people that don't have a job, a service job that has health care, sometimes they use urgent care or the emergency room as their primary care physician. So what this has done is magnified those issues.  Gupta: Epidemiologist, Dr. Camara Phyllis Jones, who was also a former president of the American Public Health Association, echoed those same sentiments.   Camara Jones: What we're seeing in these statistics right now reflects that black folks are now getting it more and that's because they're more on the frontline and less protected on the frontline, right? So it is not as easy for them to shelter in place. And it's not as easy because they might have front-facing jobs like home health aides or bus drivers or postal workers or working at Amazon and the like. They might, even if they wanted to shelter in place, not have paid sick leave available to them, although the third rescue package that the Congress passed is meant to address with that, but may not even be eligible for you know, unemployment insurance because they haven't been working at a job for two years. Gupta: But it goes even further to include a social bias.   For example, as the CDC released new guidelines urging people to wear masks, some black people have come out and said that wearing a mask could put them at even greater danger.   Here's Van Jones again.   Van Jones: We already get shot and profiled and people treat us with alarm just walking in the store to buy some Skittles. Literally. Just wearing a hoodie can be a death sentence in some communities. So the idea you're gonna be wearing a hoodie and a mask, if that's going to be the new social norm, then people need to adapt to see -- to give African American men and young women and other people of color more the benefit of the doubt. This virus is hitting different communities differently.    Gupta: So what can be done to level the playing field?   Dr. Jones told me, fundamental to all of this is still the basic idea of identifying who's sick.   Camara Jones: I think the more fundamental problem is that our whole testing strategy has been more of a clinical strategy -- that is a strategy that doctors might take to treat a disease, as opposed to a public health, kind of population-based surveillance strategy where you want to intervene on the course of the pandemic.   Gupta: She, like many other officials, is urging the government to keep comprehensive demographic data on people who are tested.    Racial and ethnic data will enable us to better inform communities at greater risk and allow us to tackle the underlying inequality that is still plaguing the system.   Camara Jones: My work for decades has, for decades now, has been on naming, measuring and addressing the impacts of racism on the health and well-being of the nation. And why am I doing that? Because we don't have to be here.   Gupta:  It is sad but true that so many black Americans have higher rates of some underlying conditions like heart disease and diabetes, conditions that may also increase their risk for Covid-19.  But again, it is these structural inequalities that have led to these higher rates of preexisting illness, lack of access to good food, lack of access to health care. And on top of that, black America is disproportionately at the front line of this pandemic. Not just within health care settings but within food delivery, grocery stores and pharmacies. People doing work, risking their lives, in order to keep the country running.  These are all factors that have made this pandemic so much more severe in parts of the black American community. I want to stress again that no one should feel immune to this disease. It is a highly transmittable virus that can infect anyone and everyone, regardless of race, socioeconomic status or location.  Ths US Surgeon General may have said it best ...   Adams: ""My recommendation is to all of America that we're really doing this to protect not just ourselves but each other. Every single person who stays at home is a person who is not spreading Covid and is a person who can protect their neighbors.""     Gupta: We need to help each other. We are dependent on each other. And the best thing we can do for now is to try and stay at home.     We'll be back tomorrow. Thanks for listening.

73,CNN,"""Let me be clear, I do not think Captain Brett Crozier is naïve nor stupid. I think, and always believed him to be the opposite,"" Modly said in his statement. ""We pick our carrier commanding officers with great care. Captain Crozier is smart and passionate. I believe, precisely because he is not naive and stupid, that he sent his alarming email with the intention of getting it into the public domain in an effort to draw public attention to the situation on his ship. I apologize for any confusion this choice of words may have caused."" Modly also apologized directly to Crozier for ""any pain my remarks may have caused."" ""(Crozier and his family), and the entire Navy, have my full commitment that I will continue to help get the TR back to full health and back to sea where we can move forward beyond this unfortunate situation,"" Modly said. Crozier had written to Navy leadership flagging his concerns about the Roosevelt's crew of more than 4,000, alerting them to the challenges of trying to contain the disease aboard the ship and urgently requesting that sailors be allowed to quarantine on land.   ""We are not at war. Sailors do not need to die. If we do not act now, we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset: our Sailors,"" Crozier wrote in a memo that three US defense officials confirmed to CNN. When asked about the comments on Monday, President Donald Trump said he ""may just get involved."" ""I haven't heard it exactly, I heard they heard,"" Trump said, referring to the crew of the USS Theodore Roosevelt. ""I heard they had a statement that was made, if that were the statement, it's a strong statement."" ""The letters shouldn't have been sent, and certainly they shouldn't have been leaked,"" Trump added. ""This is a military operation. I must tell you I've heard very good things about the gentlemen. Both gentlemen, by the way, I will say this. About both gentlemen. And I may look into it from the standpoint of something should be resolved because I'm hearing good things about both people."" 'Too naive or too stupid' As of Monday, 173 of the ship's crew have tested positive for coronavirus and 61% of the crew have been tested, according to a Navy official. Approximately 2,000 have been evacuated from the ship and moved ashore to Guam. The Navy had set a goal of moving 2,700 sailors ashore by Friday evening. In an earlier statement about his remarks to the USS Theodore Roosevelt, Modly said he couldn't verify that transcripts of his remarks were accurate but added that ""the spoken words were from the heart."" ""I stand by every word I said, even, regrettably any profanity that may have been used for emphasis,"" Modly's statement earlier Monday said. ""Anyone who has served on a Navy ship would understand. I ask, but don't expect, that people read them in their entirety."" The acting secretary's comments are coming to light at a time when multiple defense officials tell CNN that there is such growing dismay at the highest ranks of the uniformed Navy over how Crozier was relieved of duty that many senior officers feel they cannot candidly speak about their views. Modly relieved Crozier of duty late last week, citing loss of confidence and failure to adhere to the chain of command. Officials at the Pentagon are split about whether Crozier should have been relieved, but most feel the situation was badly handled and is now causing additional problems at an already difficult time. In remarks that were piped over the vessel's PA system, Modly suggested Crozier leaked the memo on purpose or was ""too naive or too stupid"" to be in command if he didn't think that sending it to over 20 people would not result in it getting out to the public.  ""If he didn't think, in my opinion, that this information wasn't going to get out to the public, in this day and information age that we live in, then he was either A, too naïve or too stupid to be a commanding officer of a ship like this,"" Modly said. ""The alternative is that he did this on purpose."" Modly went on to say it was a ""betrayal of trust, with me, with his chain of command.""   Pentagon officials privately acknowledge, however, that Crozier may have exercised questionable judgement in sending an emotional message. They also express concern about how the firing was handled, the impact on crew morale and potential political involvement by the White House.  The Washington Post's David Ignatius reported that Modly told him he had fired Crozier in part out of concern thatTrump might step into the case. ""I didn't want to get into a decision where the President would feel that he had to intervene because the Navy couldn't be decisive,"" Modly said, according to the Post. Modly's use of the word ""betrayal"" is particularly loaded because saying an officer has betrayed the Navy is a court martial offense.  'I don't know how he survives this day' One US official tells CNN that Modly did not want to wait for an investigation into the matter to be completed before firing Crozier, even though the Chief of Naval Operations, Adm. Mike Gilday wanted to pause and opposed the quick firing. Defense Secretary Mark Esper deferred the decision to Modly, who overruled Gilday. Gilday, who later publicly supported Modly in a brief statement, was expected to receive initial results Monday from the investigation into Crozier's alleged failure to notify his chain of command. But late Monday, a spokesman for the chief of naval operations announced that Gilday had approved an extension.  ""This extension will allow additional time to gather facts and refine the inquiry's recommendations,"" Cmdr. Nate Christensen said. ""The inquiry remains in progress and is expected to be completed soon. It will take additional time for the inquiry's recommendations to be reviewed and endorsed by Adm. Gilday."" Lawmakers reacted quickly to the reports of Modly's tirade. Rep. Elaine Luria, a Virginia Democrat and Navy veteran, tweeted that Esper ""should immediately fire"" the acting secretary. Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine said in a statement that Modly's comments were ""completely inappropriate and beneath the office of the Secretary of the Navy....These dedicated sailors deserve better from their leadership."" A defense official familiar with Modly's remarks also said that in his opinion, the acting secretary ""should be fired. I don't know how he survives this day."" In contrast to the acting secretary's anger, Crozier's popularity with the ship's crew was on display in videos that went viral and showed sailors giving him a warm and loud send-off, clapping and chanting his name as he left the ship for the final time.  Modly acknowledged Crozier's popularity with the crew in his remarks to the sailors. ""I cannot control or attempt to change whatever anger you have with me for relieving your beloved CO,"" Modly said, using the slang for commanding officer. ""I understand you may be angry with me for the rest of your lives."" Challenges for the Navy The acting secretary also appeared aggrieved by the warm send-off Crozer received, accusing the former commanding officer of creating a public firestorm in Washington and Guam. ""Think about that when you cheer the man off the ship who exposed you to that. I understand you love the guy. It's good that you love him. But you're not required to love him,"" Modly told the crew.  Defense officials tell CNN that Trump, after being briefed, privately indicated to the Pentagon that he thought Crozier should be relieved of duty, but that he also supported doing an investigation.   Speaking to Jake Tapper on CNN's State of the Union on Sunday, Esper was asked if there should have been an investigation before Crozier was relieved of duty. The defense secretary said only that an investigation is ongoing and that Modly had lost trust and confidence in Crozier. On Monday, a Pentagon spokesman told CNN that, ""Secretary Esper had made it clear he supported Modly's decision.""  Modly's actions now pose several challenges for the Navy. First, firing Crozier before a completed investigation, while not unprecedented, is problematic. Modly said he lost confidence in Crozier in part because he did not go to his immediate superior in the traditional chain of command to voice his worries.  But Modly also told reporters that his own chief of staff had spoken to Crozier and encouraged him to contact their office directly if needed. As the civilian head of the Navy, Modly essentially okayed going outside the chain of command, one defense official with direct knowledge of the case told CNN.         ""We are banging our heads against the wall over the chain of command issue and yet you give him a direct line to your office,"" the defense official said. The official also acknowledged Navy leadership did not anticipate the story would take on global proportions or that multiple videos taken by crew members would be circulated showing hundreds giving Crozier his rousing sendoff.  The crew's emotional send-off for their former captain puts the Navy leadership in the delicate position of making sure it doesn't publicly criticize the crew, the defense official said.  Modly also criticized Crozier for publicly detailing information about how the virus was impacting the ship. While he had previously acknowledged to reporters that he did not know if Croizer had leaked his memo to the media, Modly showed no such caution in his remarks to the crew. The acting Navy secretary essentially accused Crozier of going straight to news organizations and of painting himself as a ""martyr CO, who wasn't getting the help he needed."" He claimed he had no issue with the content of Crozier's memo, but with the fact that it became public. ""There is never a situation you should consider the media a part of your chain of command,"" Modly said. ""Imagine if every other CO also believed the media was a proper channel to air grievances with their Chain of Command under difficult circumstances."" A key issue for the investigation, the official said, is Crozier's relationship with his direct superior, Rear Admiral Stuart Baker, who was on the carrier as a senior commander overseeing several ships. Top Navy military leadership has few options but to move ahead to project confident leadership to the rank and file after months of disarray at the most senior levels. Modly remains in an acting capacity and was not selected to be nominated to the position permanently.  Former Navy Secretary Richard Spencer was fired and the nominee to replace him permanently, Kenneth Braithwaite, has not been confirmed by the Senate. Gilday himself was quickly brought in as chief of naval operations after the admiral nominated to the job stepped aside in an ethics controversy.  This story and its headline have been updated with additional developments on Monday."

75,CNN,"  It was a betrayal of trust with me, with his chain of command, with you, with the 800 to a thousand people who are your shipmates on shore right now, busting their asses every day to do what they need to do to convert what they do in a normal day to get you guys off of here, get you safe and get you healthy, get you clean, and get you back on this ship where you are supposed to be. (INDISTINCT YELLING IN BACKGROUND) It was betrayal. And I can tell you one other thing: because he did that, he put it in the public's forum, and it's now become a big controversy in Washington, DC, and across the country [LOW BACKGROUND YELLING: HE WAS ONLY TRYING TO HELP US] about a martyr CO, who wasn't getting the help he needed and therefore had to go through the Chain of Command, a chain of command which includes the media. And I'm gonna tell you something, all of you. There is never a situation where you should consider the media a part of your chain of command. You can jump the Chain of Command if you want, and take the consequences, you can disobey the chain of command and take the consequences, but there is no, no situation where you go to the media. Because the media has an agenda. And the agenda that they have depends on which side of the political aisle they sit. And I'm sorry that's the way the country is now, but it's the truth. And so they use it to divide us. They use it to embarrass the Navy. They use it to embarrass you. (INDISTINCT YELLING IN BACKGROUND) While you're out here dealing with something that this county hasn't had to deal with in over a hundred years, and the world hasn't ever dealt with anything like this on this scale, the American people believe in you. They think of all the people in the world that can keep their shit together in something like this—it's the United States Navy [INDISTINCT BACKGROUND CHATTER THROUGHOUT] and our sailors—and they're stressed. They may be stressed, they may be tired, they may be scared, but they're keeping their shit together and they're taking care of their people on the shore who are busting their ass to get them off this ship. They're not taking shots at them. They're asking, how can we help them? What can we do? How can I help the E3 that works for me? I'm an E4. I'm concerned. What do I do to help the E2's and E3's that are on this ship? That's your duty. Not to complain.   Everyone's scared about this thing. But I tell you something, if this ship was in combat and there were hypersonic missiles coming at it, you'd be pretty BLEEP scared too. [BACKGROUND YELLING: WHOA!] But you do your jobs. And that's what I expect you to do, and that's what I expect every officer on this ship to do, is to do your jobs.   One of the things about his email that bothered me the most was saying that we are not at war. Well we're not technically at war. But let me tell ya something, the only reason we are dealing with this right now is because a big authoritarian regime called China was not forthcoming about what was happening with this virus. And they put the world at risk to protect themselves and to protect their reputations. We don't do that in the Navy. We are transparent with each other, in the proper channels, and with each other. And that's what we are supposed to do and that's what you're expected to do. I got your list of questions. I'm very, very thankful to have gotten them. I know they're all sincere. I don't think there is any agenda in any of those. But there's a lot of them and I'm gonna answer every single one of them, but I've gotta do it respectfully, and I've gotta take some time so you understand all the nuances of the questions you are asking. And there's a lot of them here. So rather than answer them all today, I'm going to take them back with me to Washington and I'm going to answer them. And let me say one other thing, everything I am telling you guys now, I will never, ever, ever throw you guys under the bus in Washington or anywhere else in the media, anywhere else. And don't, I expect you never to do that to your shipmates either—the ones on the shore right now who told me that when Captain Crozier's email made it to the San Francisco Chronicle after working 15 hour days, they were demoralized because they knew what they had been doing for you guys since the 25th of March to get you  guys what you need. And the other thing you need to understand is we're in Guam. It's a US territory but they have their own government, and they have their healthcare problems, and they're scared too, just like every other part of the world. And the Governor of Guam has stuck her neck out big time with their own population to say that she is willing to open up hotel rooms all over this this country, or this state, this territory, so that sailors from the USS Teddy Roosevelt can go and be safe. Because she believes that you all are her brothers and sisters, her brothers and sisters who are protecting this place for her citizens. And so she's willing to put all that at risk to take care of you guys. And she told me today when Captain Crozier's letter came out in the public, she had to then deal with all her constituents—who are saying, ""holy crap what's happening? We're going to have 5,000 people with COVID in our city, without proper health care and everything else."" So think about that when you cheer the man off the ship who exposed you to that. I understand you love the guy. It's good that you love him. But you're not required to love him. So I want to share something with you that I read at the Navy Academy graduation in 2018. I said it to the graduating class, but I'm going to expand it a little bit. I said, as officers and sailors of the United States Military, you are given tremendous responsibility to respect and protect those who are placed under your command. The American people will trust you with their sons and daughters. And they place their security and the security of our nation in your hands. Do not expect to be loved by everyone for this—even though it may happen. As Secretary Mattis my former boss was fond of saying to us who were so honored to work with him in the Pentagon—he said your job is to protect the nation. So l'm going to give you a little bit of advice to make this important—and often difficult—job far easier on yourselves. My best advice to you is don't ever be—don't ever worry about being loved for what you do. Rather, love the country that you are asked to defend. Love the constitution you pledged your lives to protect. And importantly, love the people you are ordered to lead. Make sure they eat before you do. Care about their families as much as your own. Be invested in their success more than your own accomplishments. Nurture their careers more than you pursue your own advancement. And value their lives to the point that you will always consider their safety at every single decision you make. It's only through this level of servant leadership that you will maximize and empower those you lead to meet the demands that will face us in this century. And those demands are getting more complicated every day, as we're all learning. But it's also going to accrue incredible personal satisfaction to you during time of service. Crew of the Teddy Roosevelt. You are no obligation to love your leadership, only to respect it. You are under no obligation to like your job, only to do it. You are under no obligation to expect anything from your leaders other than they will treat you fairly and put the mission of the ship first. Because it is the mission of the ship that matters. You all know this. But in my view, your Captain lost sight of this and he compromised critical information about your status intentionally to draw greater attention to your situation. That was my judgment and I judged that it could not tolerated from the commanding officer of a nuclear aircraft carrier. This put you at great risk even though I am certain he never thought it would. I'm certain he loved you all, as he should. But he lost sight of why the TR exists and fate brought you all together in the middle of this COVID crisis. Your nation back home is struggling. No one expected this pandemic. As we are all working our way through it, your fellow sailors in the States are volunteering, putting on uniforms and running into the fire in places like New York, Los Angeles, Dallas, and New Orleans. I've seen them, no fear, running right into COVID. Nothing is easy in this for anyone. But from the very beginning, we have been engaged from my level down to bring you the help you need as fast as we possibly could. Understand it takes time to flex up for a crisis this unique. But the TR has to stand strong as warriors, not weak like victims. The TR has to work its way through this with grace, not panic. The TR has to demonstrate to the citizens back home that it has its act together, and that it is knocking down this virus, just as it would knock down the Chinese or the North Koreans or the Russians if any one of those nations were ever so stupid enough to mess with the Big Stick, because they thought she was vulnerable. I cannot control or attempt to change whatever anger you have with me for relieving your beloved CO. If I could offer you a glimpse of the level of hatred and pure evil that has been thrown my way, my family's way, over this decision, I would. But it doesn't matter. It's not about me. The former Vice President of the United States Joe Biden suggested just yesterday that my decision was criminal. I assure you it was not. [BACKGROUND YELLING: WHAT ARE YOU...] Because I understand the facts, and those facts show that what your captain did was very, very wrong, in a moment when we expected him to be the calming force on a turbulent sea.   There was very little upside in this decision for me. You can believe that or not. I made the decision for the Navy I love, for the Navy I served in, and now serve for. And mostly for the sailors I'm responsible for, not just to you here, but on nearly 300 other ships in the fleet. Your captain's actions had implications for them too. Imagine if every other CO also believed that the media was also the proper channel to hear grievances with their chain of command under difficult circumstances. We would no longer have a Navy. And not longer after that, we'd no longer have a country.   Still, I understand you may be angry with me for the rest of your lives. I guarantee you won't be alone. But being angry is not your duty. Your duty is to each other, and to this ship, and to the nation that built it for you to protect them. Even amidst an unexpected crisis, it is the mission of this ship that matters. Our adversaries are watching, and that is why we are here. We will get you the help you need. You have my personal word on it. Your CO had my personal word on that from Day One. Whatever else you may think of me, I don't go back on my word. And when it comes to the TR, whether you hate me or not, I will never, ever, ever give up this ship and neither should you. Thanks for listening, and I'll get the detailed answers to your questions to you some time later this week. Go Navy."

78,CNN,"""Congress has been crystal clear that written reasons must be given when IGs are removed for a lack of confidence. More details are needed from the administration,"" Grassley said in a statement. Earlier this year, Trump also removed Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a then-National Security Council official who had testified in the House's proceedings, along with Vindman's twin brother, both of whom were reassigned out of the NSC, and fired then-US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland. On Saturday, Trump claimed that Atkinson took the whistleblower complaint to Congress without ever requesting to see the President. ""Why was he allowed to be, you call it fraudulent or incorrect, transcript, so we offered this IG -- I don't know him, I don't think I ever met him. I don't think I -- he never even came in to see me. How can you do that without seeing the person?"" Trump said. ""Never came in to see me, never requested to see me. He took this terrible, inaccurate whistleblower report, right, and he brought it to Congress."" The President went on to repeat his claim that he had a ""perfect conversation"" with the Ukrainian President. There's no reason that Atkinson would have been required to speak to the President before notifying Congress of the whistleblower complaint. Then-acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire initially blocked the complaint from being sent to Congress, but the Trump administration ultimately relented amid the firestorm that erupted from House Democrats, who launched an impeachment inquiry that ultimately led to the President's impeachment on two articles. He was acquitted by the Senate on both charges. Last month, Atkinson wrote to Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer warning about backlash to whistleblowers, according to a copy of the letter obtained by CNN.  ""As you know, the past six months have been a searing time for whistleblowers and for those who work to protect them from reprisal or threat of reprisal for reporting alleged wrongdoing,"" Atkinson wrote, responding to a February letter Schumer sent to more than 70 inspectors general after Vindman was reassigned from the NSC. ""Those repeated assurances of support for whistleblowers in ordinary matters are rendered meaningless if whistleblowers actually come forward in good faith with information concerning an extraordinary matter and are allowed to be vilified, threatened, publicly ridiculed, or -- perhaps even worse -- utterly abandoned by fair weather whistleblower champions,"" Atkinson added. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff responded to Trump's comments Saturday, saying Atkinson ""abided by the law and the complaint was spot on."" ""Someone who follows the law and their conscience is no disgrace,"" Schiff tweeted. ""A president that fires him, he's the disgrace."" Trump said that he did not run his decision to fire Atkinson by Congress, claiming he had the absolute right to do it. ""That's my decision. I have the absolute right,"" Trump said. Trump concluded by saying someone should sue Atkinson. The President's allies defended his move. Rep. Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican who played a key role defending the President during the impeachment inquiry, charged on Twitter Saturday that Atkinson ignored the fact that the whistleblower met with a member of Schiff's staff before filing the complaint and didn't disclose the whistleblower's contacts in the Obama administration."

82,CNN,"I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent. And this is ""Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction."" Question 1 Listener: With so many people touching fresh produce and packages at grocery stores and markets, what measures need to be taken in protecting consumers from contracting the novel coronavirus? Dr. Gupta: Now, it's important to point out that coronavirus is not a food-borne illness, but a respiratory illness. You won't get it from eating food. But experts do recommend wiping down the outsides of canned or wrapped goods. You should be washing your produce anyway, so keep doing that. You should also be sure to wash your hands after unpacking your groceries.  You know the drill: soap and water for 20 seconds. Don't forget your thumbs.  Question 2 Listener: My family's in Australia and we were just discussing contingency plans because my mother takes care of my sister's kids, plus my brother has a disability. They're all very interconnected. So, my question is, if someone does get exposed and get sick, how can they best self-isolate while still under the same roof?  Dr. Gupta: This is a hard one. If an infected person lives in a shared space, that person should try to keep to a single room as much as possible. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have a really helpful home care guide that suggests steps for those living with a sick person.  Some of the recommended precautions include making sure shared spaces have good air flow, having the sick person wear a mask if they're able to, and using disposable gloves to handle potentially contaminated items like tissues or dishes.  Question 3 Listener: I'm one of the nurses here in Las Vegas. How can we be safe in taking care of the ill if we ourselves aren't protected properly?  Dr. Gupta: The answer is: You can't. That's why this question is crucial and will become even more so as our hospitals attempt to handle the flood of patients.  There are several reasons the United States may not have been equipped to handle this outbreak. According to infectious disease expert Dr. William Schaffner, a decision was made 20 or 30 years ago to under-build hospital beds because it is so expensive to build beds that aren't always used. Before that shift, there were generally more hospital beds available than necessary.  When it comes to things like masks and gowns, disruption of the international supply chain is largely to blame. The coronavirus has slowed or stopped production around the world, and we just aren't able to keep up with the demand. Unfortunately, hospitals' stockpiles of supplies proved not to be big enough. It is true that we've known this pandemic was coming for some time; since January. We had a pretty good idea of how many hospital beds we would need, how many ICU beds, and how many ventilators. We also knew how much personal protective equipment would likely be used. Unfortunately, for many weeks, we didn't do enough to ramp up the supply.  Question 4 Listener: Everyone mentions that people most at risk are elderly and people with pre-existing conditions. But pre-existing condition is a really general term, so what does that include? Dr. Gupta: Well, according to the CDC, some of the underlying conditions that may put you at higher risk include: chronic lung disease and asthma, heart disease, and undergoing cancer treatment. Anyone with diabetes, kidney failure or liver failure may also be at higher risk.  Think of it like this: In your everyday life, you're always fighting off pathogens. Most of the time you don't even realize it. If you have an underlying condition, it makes it more challenging to fight off a virus like this. You may develop a fever, shortness of breath, or a cough more easily than someone who doesn't have a preexisting illness.  A new study showed that cardiac injury could also be a common condition in hospitalized coronavirus patients. Now, since hospitals in outbreak hotspots may become overwhelmed with patients, it's important to know what symptoms are serious enough to warrant a hospital visit. If you have severe shortness of breath, along with persistent pain or pressure in your chest, then you should seek medical attention immediately.  Question 5 Listener: I'm here in San Francisco under the shelter-at-home mandate and have worked from home for at least a week now. My question is: How do I talk to my roommate about limiting his outings? I know he cares but I don't think he is concerned enough to limit his activities and therefore, putting our household at risk.  Dr. Gupta: I hope by now people are taking this virus incredibly seriously, but I can understand the lingering reluctance to follow strict rules like the ones in California.  Living through a pandemic can bring out different reactions in different people, from thinking it's not their problem to over-responding by buying too much toilet paper. If you haven't already, I would suggest talking one-on-one with your roommate or family member and explaining why it's important to you that they stay at home. You can point them to videos from the World Health Organization, or their favorite celebrity, explaining why social distancing is so important.  It's also worth reminding them that we truly are all in this together. Never before have we been so dependent on one another. How they behave directly affects your health, and how you behave, affects theirs, as well. So, if they're not practicing the guidelines for themselves, maybe they'll practice it for the ones they love.  Question 6 Listener: My question is something that I think is on a lot of peoples' minds. And that is, in your medical opinion, how long do you think this outbreak will last?  Dr. Gupta: Unfortunately, no one can answer this for sure. Some have suggested this outbreak could subside during the warmer months, but so far there is no proof of that. Scientists say it's too early to tell how or when the pandemic could truly end. In fact, I first heard this might be a recurring, seasonal illness back in February, when I interviewed the director of the CDC.  And just last week, White House coronavirus task force member Dr. Anthony Fauci said the same thing. Here he is on CNN's live town hall.  Dr. Anthony Fauci: I would not be surprised, given the efficiency with which this virus spreads, that we will see a cycle.  Dr. Gupta: But still, there is no proof so far that that's going to happen. At this point only time, and the eventual development of a trial-tested vaccine, will tell.  Dr. Gupta: Thanks so much to our listeners for all these questions.  I want to close this episode with a message I received from Dr. Donald Taylor, an emergency room physician in Virginia. He says: ""I'd like to thank the hospital cleaning staff who are critical to our fight with this virus.  They are at high risk for infection every day and have been called upon to work much more intensely than ever before.  We, as medical providers, entered medicine to care for patients.  We understand the risk. Our courageous cleaning staff, I suspect, don't get the financial compensation or training we as providers are fortunate to receive.  But without them and their hard work, I know our emergency room would fail."" Thanks for the reminder, Dr. Taylor, and thanks to cleaning and janitorial staffs at hospitals across the country. We're so grateful.  If you have questions, you can record them as a voice memo and email them to asksanjay@cnn.com -- we might include them in our next podcast. We'll be back tomorrow. Thanks for listening."
83,CNN,"""It's better to die standing than to live on your knees,"" he said, rinkside in full hockey gear, in an interview with state television. ""This is a fridge, this is healthy, there is nothing better than sport, especially ice which is the real anti-viral medicine.""    Belarus has officially reported 94 cases of coronavirus -- and no deaths -- but Lukashenko's critics have cast doubt on those statistics, warning that authorities there could be downplaying the numbers as the country gears up for a presidential election later this year.  Lukashenko has made his own recommendations to combat the virus, suggesting that Belarusians should drink vodka to ""poison the virus,"" or attend a banya.  ""I once mentioned that people need to go to banya to fight different viruses, this one included, since Covid-19 doesn't like high temperatures and dies at +60 C, as the experts informed me,"" Lukashenko said, adding that if you don't have hand sanitizer, drink vodka.  ""When you get out of sauna you shouldn't just wash your hands — down a shot of vodka,"" he said. ""I don't drink myself, and I don't advocate for it, but I'll be okay with, it's tolerable at least until Victory Day on May 9."" There is no clear evidence to indicate that the coronavirus can be controlled by high temperatures, experts say.  Business as usual Belarus has yet to close its borders -- its response so far has been limited to a two-week quarantine order for all those arriving in the country. But all of its neighbors — Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Lithuania and Latvia -- have shut theirs.  Work hasn't stopped either, as Lukashenko is concerned at how the coronavirus response is hurting the global economy. He says he found inspiration in US President Donald Trump's suggestion that the cure for Covid-19 should not be worse than the virus itself.  ""I liked his recent statements very much,"" Lukashenko said of Trump, during a visit to a plaster plant last week, according to an official transcript. ""He said, 'If we do not immediately return to enterprises and start working, then much more Americans will die from unemployment than from coronavirus.' Now you understand why I didn't close the factories."" In post-Soviet Central Asia, some local strongmen have also taken the path of coronavirus denial. In Tajikistan, a remote nation bordering Afghanistan, President Emomali Rahmon has continued a schedule of public appearances and plans to convene parliament in mid-April. Last week, Rahmon -- who is referred to in government news releases as the ""Founder of Peace and National Unity and Leader of the Nation"" — paid visits to cities taking part in a nationwide beautification project, the Republic Flower Contest, and handed out gifts to orphans. ""This humane initiative of the Head of State caused great joy,"" the government news release stated. Rahmon also went ahead with massive celebrations for Nowruz, the Persian New Year, taking part in festivities at the central stadium in the city of Khujand on March 22. The government news release featured crowds of spectators in national dress watching a colorful, choreographed spectacle and a speech by the leader. Iran, by contrast, curtailed Persian New Year celebration plans, banning non-essential travel and closing shops, in the wake of a large Covid-19 outbreak. That's not to say that Tajikistan takes coronavirus completely lightly. Tajikistan has no officially recorded cases of coronavirus, but it closed to international flights on March 19 -- cutting off an economic lifeline for a country that is heavily dependent on remittances from migrant labor. And Rahmon most recently conferred with the president of neighboring Kyrgyzstan on measures to contain the virus.  Turkmenistan, another former Soviet republic, has taken a decidedly different approach. The isolated republic is ruled by President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, who has built a formidable personality cult and has promoted folk medicine in his writings, which are mandatory reading for public officials. A March 13 readout of a cabinet meeting made no mention of the novel coronavirus or Covid-19, but did include a lengthy discourse on the benefits of burning yuzarlik (Peganum harmala), a folk remedy, to prevent infectious diseases. ""The first volume of the head of state's book, Medicinal Plants of Turkmenistan, describes methods for the preparation and use of harmala concoctions,"" the readout states. ""Our ancestors kept it in houses in the form of bundles of their branches. At times, people fumigated their home with them. They thus carried out the prevention of infectious diseases."" As other world leaders grapple with how to handle the coronavirus pandemic -- in some cases from within self-isolation — Berdymukhamedov continues to devote time to of his primary passions: Horseback riding. On Sunday, Turkmenistan's state news agency reported that the president spent the day at the Akhal-Teke equestrian complex, where he went riding and started work on a new book."

85,CNN,"2. ""And as you know, even before this development, we've been doing more tests -- tests than any other country, anywhere in the world."" ""The Lost Month: How a Failure to Test Blinded by the U.S. to COVID-19"" -- The New York Times, March 28 3. ""Let's see how it works. It may; it may not. But we may have some incredible results."" Here Trump is referencing experimental drug treatments for coronavirus. But really, this is him talking about his response to every issue that arises during his presidency. It might work. It might not. But it could be incredible. 4. ""We have some interesting things will be announced, I think over the next few weeks, but we'll see what happens."" Again, classic Trump. He hints at possible medical breakthroughs without offering any evidence. I hope he's not just bluffing but, if past is prologue, he probably is. 5. ""Even though this is different, something is going on, and you ought to look into it as reporters. Where are the masks going? Are they going out the back door? How do you go from 10,000 to 300,000?"" In which the President of the United States suggests, with zero evidence, that hospitals in New York are somehow stealing masks or purposely asking for too many from the federal government. This is a truly outrageous charge. And deeply disrespectful of the medical professionals on the front lines fighting this virus. 6. ""So, somebody should probably look into that, because I just don't see, from a practical standpoint, how that's possible to go from that to that."" ""Somebody should probably look into that,"" says the President about an accusation he made without any proof. 7. ""I hope I didn't get any of your clients in trouble, but it could be that they are in trouble. So they have to look at that in New York."" He. Just. Won't. Stop. 8. ""Many of the states are stocked up. Some of them don't admit it, but they have -- we have sent just so much -- so many things to them and -- including ventilators."" No big deal, just the President casually accusing states of lying about their medical needs in the midst of a global pandemic. Very normal stuff! 9. ""Today I spoke with Wolfgang Puck."" I did not see that coming! (Trump talked to the chef about how to save restaurants amid the economic slowdown caused by the coronavirus.) 10. ""Think of it: 151 countries. Somebody said to me today that wasn't in this particular world -- they didn't know that we had that many countries. A hundred and fifty-one countries. That's something."" [Looks directly at camera, Jim Halpert-style] 11. ""Something we did very well is, when we stopped the inflow from China at a very early level, that was a good thing to do, a great thing to do. We would have had thousands and thousands of more deaths."" The US now has more coronavirus cases than any nation in the world. 12. ""No, I want the people of New York to check -- Governor Cuomo, Mayor de Blasio -- that when a hospital that's getting 10,000 masks goes to 300,000 masks during the same period -- and that's a rapid period -- I would like them to check that. Because I hear stories like that all the time."" So, because he ""hear[s] stories like that all the time,"" Trump felt comfortable suggesting that New York is lying about their protective medical equipment needs? OK. 13. ""So I think people should check that because there's something going on, whether -- it's not -- I don't think it's hoarding; I think it's maybe worse than hoarding."" Worse than hoarding? Like, what? Selling them on a black market? Who knows -- because Trump never said. 14. ""Just like -- I'll never forget the day when a general came and said, ""Sir"" -- my first week in office -- 'we have no ammunition.'"" Nope! 15. ""It was just an aspiration. We actually will be hitting, potentially -- and this was with our meeting before -- on Easter, we probably -- they -- well, that could be a peak."" Trump is rewriting history here. At the time he said he hoped church pews would be full for Easter Sunday he never suggested that was an aspirational goal. He just said it.  16. ""So that was an aspirational number. I didn't say ""Easter."" I said, ""It would be a great thing, if we could do it by Easter."" Here's exactly what Trump said on March 24 in a Fox News town hall in the Rose Garden: ""I'd love to have it open by Easter, OK? I would love to have it open by Easter. I will tell you that right now. It's such an important day for other reasons, but I'll make it an important day for this, too. I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter."" 17. ""You know, I see things -- I see numbers. They don't matter to me."" If you don't think poll numbers matter to Trump, may I refer you to his Twitter feed for the last five years. 18. ""I mean, I know insurance companies better than anybody."" There a lot of things Trump knows ""better than anybody."" 19. ""I didn't do that at all. Read the statement. Read the statement. Read what I said. I said we're going to look into 'possibly quarantine.' I didn't say we're 'going to quarantine.'"" The question here was whether Trump regretted threatening a quarantine of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Here's exactly what Trump said: ""I am giving consideration to a QUARANTINE of developing 'hot spots', New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. A decision will be made, one way or another, shortly."" 20. ""So the concept of quarantine was thrown out to me. Really, would love to do it -- they would love to do it. And I thought it was too much to do, because the people are doing a great job with it."" Oh, so the idea of a quarantine was someone else's idea, eh? And the President didn't want to do it -- despite tweeting out the possibility to his 70+ million followers? Riiiiiiight. 21. ""I didn't say that."" This is how Trump responded to a question about him telling Sean Hannity that some governors were requesting ventilators they didn't actually need. Here's him saying it: ""And you know, they'd say, like Gov. (Andrew) Cuomo and others that say we want, you know, 30,000 of them, 30,000. All right. Think of this. You know, you go to hospitals, they'll have one in a hospital. And now, all of a sudden everybody's asking for these vast numbers."" So, yeah. 22. ""Why don't you act in a little more positive? It's always trying to 'get you.'"" Two things here. One, it's not the media's job to be ""positive."" It's our job to cover the story and hold people in power to account. Two, it's not ""gotcha"" journalism to ask the President why he said what he said last Friday about governors and ventilators. 23. ""You didn't hear me. That's why you used to work for the Times and now you work for somebody else. Look, let me tell you something: Be nice. Don't be threatening."" In which the President of the United States tells an African American female reporter (Yamiche Alcindor) that a) she was removed from The New York Times for asking negative questions (she wasn't fired, she left to join PBS' ""Newshour"") b) she should be nice  (again, not the media's job) and c) her question was ""threatening"" (it was wasn't -- it was about what Trump said two days ago). Unreal. 24. ""When journalists get up and ask questions that are so threatening -- we're all on the same team."" I shouldn't really need to write this but: Holding people in power to account is an act of patriotism. 25. ""When I hear facemasks go from 10,000 to 300,000, and they constantly need more, and the biggest man in the business is, like, shocked."" Just a reminder: The reason mask requests are soaring is because we are dealing with a virus for which humans have no immunity and for which there is no vaccine.   26. ""And remember, we started with a system that was broken. For many years, it was broken. And I'm not blaming the last administration."" [narrator voice] He actually is. 27. ""We took over a dead, barren system. We took over a system that was obsolete. It was -- it was good for a tiny, little sample of people."" The key takeaway for Trump in all of this: It's not his fault! You can't blame him! 28. ""We could have done it on Easter, but there was a good chance that if it's coming down or if it's still going up -- maybe it's going to be coming down by then.""  [Jim Halpert stare] 29. ""You know, again, because of what we've done and because of the fact that we've stopped the flow from China so early -- because the question is, from a lot of my friends, 'Why didn't we just wing it?  Why didn't we just wing it?'""  Really??? Trump's friends were asking why we didn't just ""wing"" our response to a global pandemic? 30. ""So you're going to have tremendous suicides, but you know what you're going to have more than anything else?  Drug addiction. You will see drugs being used like nobody has ever used them before."" In which the President tries to justify his now-walked-back claim that extended periods of social distancing would destroy the economy and cause more deaths than the virus if left to its own devices. Insanity. 31. ""I spoke to great people today that have done a great job. And one day, at the top of their business, they're celebrity chefs, they've got the most successful restaurants, and in one day they have nothing."" ""They're celebrity chefs."" 32. ""Anxiety causes, you know, disease, they say. A lot of people -- you're going to have tremendous."" So, uh, well, um, OK. 33. ""But I didn't say that. I didn't say that."" The question -- from CNN's Jeremy Diamond -- was why Trump had said ""if they don't treat you right, I don't call"" about the nation's governors last week. Here's video of Trump saying exactly that. 34. ""No, I don't call. No, I don't call the governor of Washington now."" So, Trump is saying he didn't say the thing he did but then admitting that he is actually not calling governors who he doesn't believe are appreciative enough of the help the federal government is providing? Truly mind-boggling stuff. 35. ""I don't have to call because I'm probably better off not, because we don't get -- he's a failed presidential candidate. He's a nasty person. I don't like the governor of Washington."" ""Modern day presidential"" 36. ""In 100 years, you could bet your life that he would never be here with CNN and all their cameras, if they're bad, because we help their ratings."" Totally false. In the midst of a global pandemic, it's the media's job to cover -- and contextualize -- what the President and his advisers are saying and doing. Ratings have zero to do with it. Zero. 37. ""Unfortunately, the enemy is death. It's death. A lot of people are dying, so it's very unpleasant. It's a very unpleasant thing to go through."" This feels like a good place to end."
86,CNN,"Coupe: What is supposed to be one of the happiest times of my life has just turned into a bit of a mess of chaos and confusion.  Dr. Gupta: Most of us are already finding it tough to deal with the novel coronavirus. So, imagine the challenge of expecting -- without knowing what to expect.   In this episode, we talk about how to deal with a pandemic when you're pregnant.  I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent. And this is ""Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction.""  Coupe: I have a lot of questions. Am I going to be safe? Is my doctor going to be safe? Is my baby going to be safe? Dr. Gupta: These are the kinds of questions pregnant women are asking all over the country.   Pregnant women are vulnerable because they generally have lowered immune systems. So, they have to be really cautious. The good news is that right now, there's no evidence that they're at a higher risk of being infected with this virus. But infants are vulnerable to it -- a recent report in China shows that 11% of children who contracted the virus were under a year old, ended up in critical condition. We still don't know if pregnant women can transmit the virus to their babies. To date, the novel coronavirus has not been found in breast milk or in amniotic fluid.   Now, those are the physical risks. Women are now also facing heightened mental and emotional concerns. T: You wait and wait and wait to get pregnant and then you realize once you're pregnant, you're about to have a baby. And that's really gonna change our lives. Dr. Gupta: We spoke to a woman who's facing this dilemma. She lives in New Jersey, but her hospital is in New York City.   I'm going to call her T, because she doesn't want us to reveal her full name.   T and her husband have always wanted to have kids -- though it took them a few years to get there.   T: I have a condition called PCOS. It just makes it difficult for me to get pregnant naturally. So, for me and my husband, we started trying pretty much right after we were married about six years ago.    Dr. Gupta: Eventually, they tried IVF -- and it worked.    After six years of waiting, T was pregnant with a baby girl.   T: I would say it was probably one of the best days of my life to hear that. It's really just been a desire to do all the other things that pregnant women do, and that's been us figuring out if we want to take a babymoon and then wanting to do maternity photoshoots and starting to plan a baby shower. And it's just this last trimester has been crazy because those last few things that we wanted to do at this point just seem to be disappearing. Dr. Gupta: There's something else T is worried about. She was diagnosed with gestational diabetes, which means she's considered a high-risk pregnancy. There could be complications during delivery, and there is an increased likelihood of needing a C-section.   T: There could be a problem with her, not to mention there is already documented evidence of higher mortality rates for African-American women in labor.   Dr. Gupta: T is right -- studies have shown that black women are three to four times more likely to die of childbirth than white women.   Because of her high-risk pregnancy, T says she likes having a birth plan in place. T: I feel more secure when I know I have options. And I don't freak out as easily if I know this didn't work because I can follow up with this, go to plan C, whatever.  Dr. Leana Wen: It's hard because this is a time when plans can be made and will be broken. I suppose that's true in pregnancy in general, but especially in these circumstances.   Dr. Gupta: That's Dr. Leana Wen. She's worn a lot of hats in her career -- she's practiced as an emergency doctor, she was Baltimore's health commissioner, and she was also the director of Planned Parenthood.    But there's one more thing that makes her a uniquely qualified voice.   Dr. Wen: I also am almost 39 weeks pregnant as of the time that we are speaking. I mean, I have a recurring nightmare myself of contracting Covid-19, and going through childbirth where I have to wear a mask.  And if my newborn were to get ill, she would become extremely ill because she doesn't have immunity and little babies are so fragile. And I know of so many other pregnant women who have their own anxieties in this time.   Dr. Gupta: So, what happens when a new mother does have Covid-19? Dr. Wen: Because Covid-19 is a respiratory virus, if the mom were to cough and then she coughed onto her hand and then her hand touched the baby, she could infect her newborn that way. And so, the precautions that are being recommended by the CDC, as of the time that we are speaking, includes having safeguards to separate the mom and the newborn.  Dr. Gupta: Separating a mother from her newborn is an incredibly hard decision -- the CDC recommends that families should speak to their doctors to weigh the risks and benefits of doing this. And if they do decide on a temporary separation, the CDC also recommends that mothers who intend to breastfeed use a breast pump, so the baby can still be fed while reducing contact. Dr. Wen: There are a lot of different safeguards that need to be taken that are probably very different from what any expectant mom had otherwise anticipated.  My hospital, which is where I delivered my first child, used to encourage the entire family to be present at birth. Now, new guidelines came out just in the last week that limit the number of visitors to one person. Dr. Gupta: In a global pandemic, where things change by the hour, hospital guidelines are also in constant flux.  In New York, the current center of the virus in the United States, some hospital systems like Mount Sinai and New York Presbyterian had initially barred any visitors from delivery. T: I just was crying uncontrollably. I knew I had to calm myself down. I know it wasn't the best position for me to be putting the baby in. I was extremely devastated. It was literally, to me at that point, the worst possible news. Dr. Gupta: Then a week later, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced an executive order requiring all hospitals to allow one person throughout labor and delivery. Both hospital systems said they would follow the order and reversed their policies. Coupe: Relieved isn't even the right word. It's like a 100-million-pound gorilla has just come off my chest. Dr. Gupta: Here's Courtney again. Coupe: Knowing that my husband couldn't be with me has been such an emotional roller coaster. So, to know that he'll be able to be there, that he'll be able to meet his child is just an incredible relief.  Dr. Gupta: Courtney's hospital, New York Presbyterian, is also taking a lot of extra precautions for labor and delivery.  The hospital is testing all women in labor for the virus and giving them -- as well as the staff -- face masks to wear during delivery. Courtney's thankful and relieved that they're taking these extra steps. But she's also preparing herself for the fact that everything can change. Coupe: I am really just mere weeks away from my due date. And seeing how this has gone so far, anything can happen in these last few days. Dr. Gupta: There's no easy answer to this. I can't even begin to imagine the level of stress and anxiety that these women are feeling.    Margaret Howard: The thing that I tell women is, look, anxiety is a natural and adaptive response that we have when we feel uncertain or unsafe or threatened in some way. Dr. Gupta: That's Dr. Margaret Howard. She's a professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Brown University, where she specializes in women's mental health during and after pregnancy.   I want you to listen to some of her important advice for expectant moms. Howard: I think one of the very best things that expectant moms can do right now is to take back kind of a little bit of that sense of control, and control that which they can. Because right now there's so much in their lives that they can't control -- like, nobody can control the virus.  But you know what they can control? They can control what they listen to, what they watch, and they can also control things like their lifestyle. You know, what are they eating? What are they drinking? This is a good time to be really mindful of -- this is for all of us -- what we're putting in our bodies. Dr. Gupta: We asked T what she's hopeful about, what keeps her going through all this. And here's what she said.   T: I mean, I think it's me thinking back five years ago feeling like, ""Man, I hope this happens one day."" So, it's almost this urge to not let anything take away the joy of the fact that I am pregnant. I think that's the only thing that I'm trying to stay calm about and focused on, is that it's not going to help her if I'm physically feeling stressed and I know that I can try to control it as much as possible. I can't filter the information I'm getting, but I can try to manage how I respond to it for her, and just realizing that, you know, we went through all of this for her to come home.    Dr. Gupta: If you're an expectant mom, be kind to yourself. Be your own best cheerleader, and surround yourself with other cheerleaders who can support you. There is a lot of anxiety while being pregnant during this time, but don't let that drown out the fact that there's such a joy in expecting a child as well.   We'll be back tomorrow. Thanks for listening.  "

88,CNN,"Facts First: While the market had previously set all-time records under Trump, on March 5, 22 days before Trump's comments, the Dow dropped 3.6% or 970 points, then its fifth-worst single-day point drop on record, adding to a 3,000-point drop since its peak on February 12. That day's fall in the Dow followed drops of 1,000 points and 800 points earlier that week. How unforeseen the coronavirus crisis was Multiple times throughout Friday's press briefing, the President claimed the current situation was unprecedented and unforeseen. According to Trump, ""nobody was prepared for this,"" not even past presidents. He added, ""In all fairness to all of the former presidents, none of them ever thought a thing like this could happen."" Facts First: This is false. The US intelligence community and public health experts had warned for years that the country was at risk from a pandemic. Experts had also warned that the country would face shortages of critical medical equipment, such as ventilators, if a pandemic occurred. You can read a full fact check here about some of the pandemic warnings. You can read a full fact check here about warnings about the need for additional ventilators in a pandemic. The former GM plant in Lordstown, Ohio  As he did on Twitter earlier on Friday, Trump suggested at the briefing that General Motors should manufacture ventilators at its plant in Lordstown, Ohio. ""...frankly, I think that would be a good place to build the ventilators, but we'll see,"" Trump said. Facts First: General Motors sold the shuttered Lordstown facility in November 2019.  Trump had applauded the potential sale in a tweet in May 2019. Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown said on Twitter after Trump's Friday tweet but before the briefing: ""General Motors sold Lordstown. If the President cared about its former workers, he would know that.""  The coronavirus and the flu Trump said of the coronavirus: ""You can call it a germ, you can call it a flu, you can call it a virus, you know you can call it many different names. I'm not sure anybody even knows what it is."" Facts First: You cannot accurately call the coronavirus ""a flu."" They are, simply, different viruses with different characteristics, though they share some symptoms the coronavirus has a much higher mortality rate. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Thursday during an online chat with NBA star Stephen Curry that the coronavirus is ""very much more transmissible than flu and more importantly, it's significantly more serious"" -- with a mortality rate approximately 10 times higher than the 0.1% for the flu.  It's also obviously untrue that there is not ""anybody"" who knows what the coronavirus is. Though it was initially seen as a mystery virus when it emerged in China, we knew its genetic information by early January.  New York and ventilators  Trump said, ""We sent thousands of ventilators to New York and they didn't know about it at the time, they were complaining. Thousands. We had 2,000 and then 2,000 and then 4,000, and they were going there in large numbers."" Trump also said at the briefing that New York had been unaware of thousands of ventilators sitting in ""a warehouse.""  Facts First: There is no evidence that New York did not know ventilators had arrived from the federal government when Gov. Andrew Cuomo was demanding additional ventilators. ""Not true,"" New York state Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker told CNN's Chris Cuomo on Friday night. ""We knew the ventilators arrived -- and we need more ventilators. This is just the beginning of addressing the problem that we have."" Zucker specified that a total of 4,000 ventilators had been received, not the 8,000 Trump suggested here. Here's a rough timeline of what happened. Cuomo said last weekend that the state needed 30,000 ventilators. Trump tweeted Tuesday morning that 400 ventilators had been secured for New York City. Cuomo replied at a news conference that 400 ventilators were not cause for self-congratulation, adding, ""What am I going to do with 400 ventilators when I need 30,000?"" It was later on Tuesday that Vice President Mike Pence announced that 2,000 additional ventilators had been shipped to New York that day and that 2,000 more would be shipped the following day. Cuomo told CNN on Friday that Trump was ""incorrect and grossly uninformed"" in his comments about New York having been unaware of a stockpile of ventilators sitting around in New York. Cuomo said the state does not need to dip into the stockpile at the moment; he said his estimate of 30,000 ventilators needed is about the expected peak of the crisis in approximately 21 days, not about the present moment. ""So the point is, 'Well they're in a stockpile, you must not need them' is just ignorant -- of course you don't need them today!"" Cuomo said. ""You need them when you hit the apex, which is 30,000. We're not there yet."" Tariffs on China Trump said, ""China pays 25% interest on $250 billion worth of product that they send in."" Facts First: Trump was inaccurately describing his 25% tariff on $250 billion worth of Chinese products.  A tariff is, simply, not the same as ""interest."" It is a tax paid by the importer -- the American purchaser -- not a charge paid by an entity that has borrowed money. Study after study has shown that Americans are bearing the cost of the tariffs; Americans make the actual tariff payments.    This story has been updated with additional fact checks."
89,CNN,"Dr. Sanjay Gupta: We've seen wild swings in the stock market over the past few weeks. The S&P dropped to its lowest level in over three years this week, unemployment rates are soaring and a global recession is now expected this year. But lawmakers in Washington have reached an agreement on a $2 trillion stimulus package.  At the same time, doctors around the world are scrambling to address the Covid-19 outbreak and facing some difficult decisions about how to best care for their patients. On today's episode, we're looking at what happens when we're presented with the choice of saving lives or saving the economy.  I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent. And this is ""Coronavirus, Fact vs. Fiction."" Dr. Gupta: My specialty is medicine, not the economy. So for part of this episode, I want to hand things over to CNN's Chief Business Correspondent, Christine Romans.  She is our resident explainer-in-chief of all things money. Christine spoke with billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who recently made headlines with his radical proposal to save the US economy. Bill Ackman, founder and CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management: What I'm proposing is a 30-day lockdown of the entire country, a coordinated 50-state lockdown. I call it the ""rip the Band-Aid off"" strategy. Christine Romans: Why do you think that's the best option to rescue the economy?  Ackman: The interests of the economy and the interests of the health care system are really identical here. The economy will recover quickly if we can shut down the virus. And the way to shut down the virus is the ultimate in social distancing, i.e. a total country shutdown.  And what I mean by shutdown or lockdown is basically what they're doing in New York state right now, but on a national basis -- which means all essential services, obviously health care, infrastructure, transportation, food, agriculture, you know, things that you need, you know, people need to eat, people need to be taken care of, etc. Those things continue. But everything else, you know, is a work-from-home mode. That's basically what they did in Wuhan, that's what we need to do in the United States. That's what they're doing in the UK. That's what they announced in India. Romans: You know, the President himself said he doesn't want the cure to be worse than the problem. Do we risk dragging this out and really crushing capitalism if we can't fix it now and then move on and have it behind us? Ackman: Yes. So the President is right in the sense that you don't want the cure to be worse than the problem. The problem is that the President, by not instituting a lockdown and trying to reopen the country early, when you've only had kind of a rolling series of partial lockdowns in maybe a dozen states, is that the virus will be completely out of control.  And instead of using the next week of this 15 days to squelch the virus and do it for real. If instead you said, look, we're gonna rip the Band-Aid off to take the hard step of locking down the entire country at once. By the way, we're going to do it for 30 days and then we've got to carefully reopen parts of the economy.  We're going to have to maintain social distancing. We're going to have to you know, people are gonna have to wear masks. People are going to have to be careful. But we start to begin the recovery. And with the beginning of the recovery, you'll see a massive recovery in the stock market that will help to build confidence.  You know, business fundamentally is a confidence game. And what's happened in the last period here is there's been a dramatic loss in confidence. If you look at the Chinese economy, what's interesting is the stock market in China began to fall as the virus number of cases went to skyrocket.  So if you look at the chart and the case level is skyrocketing up to into the sky and the market's plunging into the into the floor, if you will. And then as the cases begin to slow and eventually they almost capped the number of cases, the stock market began to soar again. And the stock market is sort of the best weather vane on how the economy's gonna do three, six months from now. Romans: How much of a recovery bet are you making on the economy? Ackman: We've invested about two and a half billion dollars of our investors' assets in stocks in the last ten days. We've been aggressively buying stocks that have been marked down. Prices are down 30%, 40%, 50% or more. So we've been, you know, betting that the economy is going to recover from here. Dr. Gupta: That was Bill Ackman -- the founder and CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management. The economy is also top of mind for New York's Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Gov. Andrew Cuomo: This is unsustainable that we close down the economy and we continue to spend money. There is no doubt about that, no one is going to argue about that. But if you ask the American people to choose between public health and the economy, then it's no contest. No American is going to say, accelerate the economy at the cost of human life. Because no American is going to say how much a life is worth. Dr. Gupta: He went on to say ... Cuomo: My mother is not expendable. And your mother is not expendable. And our brothers and sisters are not expendable.  Dr. Gupta: Gov. Cuomo's remarks got me thinking about medical ethics and some of the tricky hypotheticals we talked about in medical school ... Now, some doctors are having to make those hard choices in real life. For more on this, I turned to a friend, and an expert: CNN Medical Analyst Arthur Caplan. He's also the director of the medical ethics division at NYU's Langone Medical Center. I asked him how you really can put a value on a human life. Art Caplan: If everybody gets an equal opportunity to be considered, people understand that not everyone can live. They don't want to see bias. They don't want to see discrimination. Everybody wants to get a chance. Americans will accept rationing if they think the system is fair. That's what I've learned. Dr. Gupta: The issue that I think a lot of people are starting to ask about is, is this an either-or conversation? Is there either economic damage or health damage?  Caplan: We can't just say we're going to be in isolation and distancing and quarantining for the next two weeks, and then we've got to come out because we've got to fix the economy. I don't think that's realistic and I don't think it's the right thing to do. It's not because I think you've got to put lives ahead of money, because I understand those who say the economy being in the tank also can cost lives.  There can be starvation. There can be crime. It can be a lot of ways in which people may die because the economy isn't functioning. But we've got to maintain the only weapon we've got right now, which is the social isolation and the distancing. I don't even think you can restore the economy in the middle of a pandemic.  You know, putting it crudely. There'll be so many people surging and dying and trying to get into the hospital system that you'd break it. You can't run the economy with no health care system because you've overwhelmed it. And that would happen if we stop being prudent and stop trying to isolate too soon. If we want to get the economy started, the best thing the federal government can do is give us testing. Then you can start to isolate and quarantine the infected, and then you can probably start to let some people go back out to work. And by the way, that's the lesson from South Korea. It seems to me how they've gotten through this and are starting to open up. China's lesson was severe quarantine really enforced, if you will, at the point of a gun. We've not been willing to do that. But South Korea seemed to have plenty of testing, and they knew who to isolate. And I think that's why those two places are coming back more quickly. Gupta: One of the things that sort of struck me was this this comment that I heard about these families that are really suffering economically, and the concern that their quality of life has greatly diminished and that there's maybe increasing suicide rates and things like that. It becomes a little a little blurry there. Right? It's not just about the economy in that situation.  Caplan: Well, I think that's right. There are public health consequences to isolating everyone for weeks. Domestic violence, suicide. Let's not forget that there are many people lonely. I can imagine other people who are impaired with cognitive disorders, Alzheimer's, strokes. What are they experiencing? What is it like? So I think this is a time where Americans do have to look out for one another. Call one another. Contact one another. It wouldn't even bother me if they went over to the yard and waved at one another. I think those kinds of supports are crucial to getting us through this impossibly difficult, but nonetheless, something we have to endure, period. Gupta: It's a good point. When you look at this overall plan over the next several weeks. In in the spirit of optimism, do you see the light at the end of the tunnel, as has been described? You do have a timetable that you think this is going to take? Caplan: Well, I have some optimism that not next week and not next month, but within the next six months, I think we'll start to see some drugs appear that do have a beneficial impact, at least in maybe attenuating, tamping down the nastiness of the disease, maybe shifting it from death sentence to survivability.  Again, it's optimistic, but there are so many teams working diligently out there. If we do this rapid testing and rapid clinical trial design that's in place, that's starting to move through our system, and indeed worldwide, I think we have the brainpower to come up with something.  Dr. Gupta: We don't yet know the lasting economic effect of the Covid-19 pandemic -- but I can tell this isn't really an either/or conversation. We know we're going to see an impact on the economy and also a loss of human life. As doctors, we take an oath to protect human life to the best of our ability.  Not only do we need to get people healthy first before we can rebuild the economy, we have to. One can't happen without the other. A lot of people are going to be exposed to this virus, but we need to focus on slowing the pace of exposure so hospitals are not overrun. Now is not the time to pull back on social distancing efforts. We finally have some evidence that they're starting to work. For the short run at least, we need to prioritize public health and try to get this situation under control.  This isn't gong to last forever. When you look at China and South Korea and look at their timetable, it was around 8-10 weeks. Now it might be different here in the united states, but it's clearly not gonna be forever. And don't forget, as I've said, we're all in this together.  Never before have we been as dependent on one another as we are now. At least not in my lifetime. We'll be back tomorrow.

90,CNN,"Trump: And it's shown very encouraging — very, very encouraging early results.  And we're going to be able to make that drug available almost immediately.   Dr. Gupta: Last Friday, a reporter asked coronavirus task force member Dr. Anthony Fauci whether there was any evidence that chloroquine was effective against Covid-19. Fauci said, ""No."" Dr. Anthony Fauci: The information that you're referring to specifically is anecdotal; it was not done in a controlled clinical trial. So you really can't make any definitive statement about it.  Dr. Gupta: If you're confused, you're not alone.   Let me start by saying this: There is currently no proven treatment or cure for the novel coronavirus. But I can see how that might sometimes be unclear, since some drug names are being talked about as if they may be already working.   Names like chloroquine and remdesivir. They're hard to pronounce -- and even harder to prove that they're effective.  So in this episode, I'll break down the latest information and also answer some of your questions about possible drug treatments for the coronavirus.   I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent. And this is ""Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction.""   Dr. Gupta: First, let's talk about how our government officials are describing a drug called chloroquine. Trump: This has been something that's been around for many years. It's been a phenomenal, strong, powerful drug for malaria. But we think it might work on this.   Dr. Gupta: Chloroquine is used to treat malaria, and has been around for decades. But it has not been approved as a treatment for the coronavirus. Here's CNN's medical analyst and infectious disease specialist, Dr. Celine Gounder.   Dr. Celine Gounder: This is not a slam dunk. This is early, promising research. But that doesn't mean this is going to work.  Dr. Gupta: The president also tweeted over the weekend that a related drug, hydroxychloroquine, in combination with an antibiotic commonly known as a Z-Pak, could become quote ""game changers.""  This is largely based on a very small study in France that excluded some people who either left the hospital, stopped taking the drug due to side effects, or got worse -- including one person who died. We still don't have enough evidence that these drugs are effective in humans. That's why in some states, they are beginning to experiment. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo: Hydroxychloroquine, which the president speaks about, and is optimistic about, and we hope for optimistic results, also. We're actually starting that today. Dr. Gupta: That's New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. He recently announced that the state had procured thousands of doses of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine and would begin trials starting Tuesday. The state will also begin testing another experimental treatment using the plasma of people who have recovered. It's called convalescent serum.  Cuomo: What it does is it takes the plasma from a person who has been infected with the virus, processes the plasma, and injects the antibodies into a person who is sick.   Dr. Gupta: The other drug name being floated around is an antiviral called remdesivir. It's already being tested on adults diagnosed with the coronavirus in the United States and China.  The Director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Robert Redfield, discussed remdesivir in congressional testimony earlier this month.   CDC Director Robert Redfield: We're going to know probably by April whether that drug works or not, and that's important because that's a drug that can save lives if it works.  Dr. Gupta: Gilead Sciences, which manufactures remdesivir, is pulling back on emergency requests for the drug due to overwhelming demand. The company is instead focusing its efforts on giving out the drug in clinical trials, hoping to prove its effectiveness against Covid-19. I want to reiterate that we don't know how effective any of these treatments will be. While a number of patients have already received drugs like chloroquine and remdesivir, it's too early to know how much of an impact the drugs actually had. That's why doctors are conducting studies in the US, China and all over the world, to better understand what happens when you give these drugs to a Covid patient.  Getting the results could take months. And in the meantime, we have to be careful about creating false hope.    News report: A man in Arizona has died after ingesting chloroquine phosphate, believing that it would prevent him from contracting coronavirus. Dr. Gupta: Banner Health, a company that operates acute-care hospitals, released a statement on Monday confirming that a man in Arizona had died after taking a form of chloroquine used to clean aquariums. His wife is currently in critical care. NBC News spoke to the wife who said they learned of the drug's connection to the coronavirus during a news conference on TV. In Nigeria, health officials issued a warning about chloroquine, saying three people overdosed on the drug after hearing it described as a possible treatment.  Dr. Gupta: I can't stress enough how vital it is that you don't use or consume anything unless specifically recommended by your doctor.   You're likely to soon hear other drug names mentioned as well. Nevan Krogan, a senior investigator at the Gladstone Institute of Data Science and Biotechnology in San Francisco, worked on a study published last weekend that identified 69 existing drugs that could be tested against the coronavirus.  Nevan Krogan: In total, we identified 332 proteins talking to or connected to the coronaviral proteins. And we identified 69 different drugs and compounds that are known to target at least one of these 332 proteins. And this corresponds to 27 different FDA-approved drugs and the remaining are in clinical or pre-clinical trials.  Dr. Gupta: Krogan said testing out drugs that are already FDA-approved could drastically speed up the process of finding a treatment that is safe and effective for humans.  And then there's the prospect of a vaccine. Experts say one wouldn't be ready this year. Drug and vaccine tests take months or years in order to be proven safe for humans, and there are multiple stages of those trials. But Krogan is optimistic that the global response from scientists now will set a precedent for getting to a solution faster in the future. Krogan: For me, I would argue that what we're seeing is a new paradigm of how to do science. And I hope we're setting up an infrastructure here that could be beneficial, not just for Covid-19, but for the future, for Covid-22, Covid-24 [and] what other virus comes online over the next several years, and they will be coming. Dr. Gupta: Our best protection for now: social distancing, washing our hands, looking out for ourselves and our loved ones, trying to help out wherever we can, and behaving like we might have the virus. If you have questions, you can record them as a voice memo and email them to asksanjay@cnn.com -- we might even include them in the podcast.  We'll be back tomorrow. Thanks for listening. "
91,CNN,"A virus doesn't discriminate. Nor should we. I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent. This is ""Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction."" Kyung Lah: So we were working just, you know, clearly a television crew working, and a man walked up. And he said something right next to my producer.  Dr. Gupta: That's my colleague Kyung Lah, Senior National Correspondent for CNN. Lah: As I asked him to repeat himself, I said, 'Excuse me, sir, can I help you?' It was dawning on me what he had said. He had used a derogatory term, you know, talked about a long-held xenophobic stereotype about immigrants. And it was just surreal. It's not something that I'd experienced to my face in a very long time.  Dr. Gupta: Kyung is Korean-American and based in Los Angeles. She herself was targeted. Lah: It's still really hard for me to explain how it makes me feel. I joked about it on Twitter and said, if you're gonna be racist, please be accurate. I'm Korean, not Chinese. Not that that matters at all.  Dr. Gupta: It doesn't matter at all. And she's not alone.   San Francisco State University found that news about coronavirus discrimination increased by 50% across the country, from February 9th through March 7th. That's just one month. The lead researcher on the project told the New York Times that this is only the ""tip of the iceberg""... Meaning only the most serious cases would be reported and there are likely many more cases out there. Dr. Gupta: Even on social media -- we're seeing the same thing.  Just last week Eugenie Grey, a blogger in New York, was out walking her dog when a passerby kicked the dog. She described what happened on Instagram.  Eugenie Grey: I'm sorry. I wasn't gonna cry when I started recording, and then I just started crying right now. I'm just so upset because who [BLEEP] kicks dogs? You guys, I'm not a virus. Dr. Gupta: It's not just individual attacks.  Earlier this year, with only a handful of novel coronavirus cases in America, Chinese restaurants were already suffering.   Rose Wu: (speaks in Chinese) In New York City's Chinatown, restaurant owner Rose Wu told us many of her customers canceled their Chinese New Year bookings last minute. That was just as the city of Wuhan, in China, was going into lockdown.  Rose Wu: (speaks in Chinese) Rose says some customers told her they canceled out of fear of catching the virus because she and her staff are Chinese.  By mid-February, Rose's business was down some 70 to 80 percent. That was weeks before most of America started staying at home.  Unfortunately, the list goes on and on.   Here's what President Trump had to say when a reporter asked him about it: Reporter: Why do you keep calling this the Chinese virus? There are reports of dozens of incidents of bias against Chinese Americans in this country. Your own aide, Secretary Azar, has said he does not use this term. He says ethnicity does not cause the virus. Why do you keep using this? President Donald Trump: Because it comes from China. Reporter: People say it's racist. Trump: It's not racist at all, no, not at all. It comes from China. That's why. It comes from China. Dr. Gupta: That was on March 18th. Five days later, President Trump reversed course. He opened a press conference on Sunday with this statement: Trump: It's very important that we totally protect our Asian-American community in the United States and all around the world. They're amazing people and the spreading of the virus is not their fault in any way, shape or form. Dr. Gupta: The president rebuking racism is certainly a welcome development and the right thing to do.  For some Asian-Americans, like my colleague Kyung Lah, the damage had been done.  Lah: When certain members of the political establishment began using the term Chinese virus, when Fox News repeatedly called it Chinese virus, that's when I noticed an uptick in the level of hate on social media. That is not a mistake. I think that you can absolutely show that there is a correlation.  Dr. Gupta: Merlin Chowkwanyun is a historian who studies inequality and activism at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health.  Merlin Chowkwanyun: I mean words and language ... they really matter and they frame the larger public imagination towards this issue. And so I hope we can remember the history of blaming immigrants and racial minorities for diseases and avoid reviving it too much this time. Dr. Gupta: As you heard him say -- this isn't the first time that an infectious disease outbreak has been linked to certain immigrant groups. It's a pattern that has been repeated in history.  Chowkwanyun: So in the mid 19th century, for example, shortly before the Civil War, it was actually the Irish who were often blamed for cholera epidemics. In the early 20th century, during a polio epidemic, it was Italians who got scapegoated a lot. Jews from Eastern Europe were often blamed for tuberculosis, as were African Americans.   Dr. Gupta: That kind of xenophobia didn't just manifest in individual violence, but also in institutional policies like the Immigration Act of 1924, which severely limited immigration from Asia and parts of Europe. Chowkwanyun: If you go back and read the proceedings in debates, federal commissions that were deliberating these kinds of immigrant restrictions, you see all sorts of references to epidemics and immigrants and sickness and the threats that they pose.   Dr. Gupta: Thankfully, people have been calling out the racism they are witnessing.   Last week, actor Tzi Ma posted a video as he washed his hands.   Tzi Ma (Twitter clip): Acts of violence against Asian Americans will not stop the spread of the virus. Dr. Gupta: It's part of an online campaign called #washthehate, which aims to raise awareness about the harassment that people are now facing.  Tzi Ma (Twitter clip): So the next time you wash your hands, wash out the hate that you may have for your fellow Americans. Hate will get you sick even if the virus doesn't.  Dr. Gupta: His sentiments are being echoed by other celebrities and government officials. Even comedians are talking about it.  Here's Anhtriet Tran performing at a comedy show called ""Asians Strike Back"" earlier this month.   Anhtriet Tran: The coronavirus has just opened the floodgates for people to be racist to Asians. You know there's one that's very popular, it's oh like Asians. We like to eat dogs. So stupid. You guys know how expensive a dog is?  Dr. Gupta: But even comedy can't erase the hurt being felt by many in our country.   I asked my colleague Kyung what advice did she have for people out there. Here's what she said.  Kyung Lah: It is a virus that sees no race, that sees no boundaries. And if we do not treat this uniformly as a public, this is going to get the better of us. That's what I would say. We are all the same when we are fighting this thing. So we better start acting like one or else we're not going to get through this.  Dr. Gupta: Kyung's right. These are scary times for all of us. But what we need to do is unify and realize that we are stronger if we stick together.  All of us are going through this and we will come out of it.  Hatred does not have -- and never will have -- any place in our country. So if you see someone getting mistreated, call it out for what it is. That's part of standing up for each other. We're all in this together. If you have questions, you can record them as a voice memo and email them to asksanjay@cnn.com -- we might even include them in the podcast. We'll be back Monday. Thanks for listening.

96,CNN,"That's why in today's episode, I invited my colleague -- CNN anchor Kate Bolduan -- who's also a mother herself -- to talk about how we, as parents, can get through this together with our kids.  I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent. And this is ""Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction."" Dr. Gupta: You have two daughters. I have three daughters. Your daughters are five and two?  Kate Bolduan: Five and two. Yeah. Dr. Gupta: Five and ... I can't believe, Kate, that you have ... I still remember. Before you had any kids. Bolduan: Oh yeah. Yeah. Dr. Gupta: Your kids are young? Did you talk to them about it? Bolduan: I typically try to protect them from the news, which isn't easy, obviously, because of my job. But, you know, that's how I approach it when I'm dealing with a stressful situation.  But that strategy, speaking to, kind of, the unprecedented nature of this, completely failed on me here. Then my daughter came running out of school and she said, ""Mom, there is something called Corona and everybody is getting sick,"" says my 5-year-old. And I did not handle it well. I said, ""Oh, that's nothing to worry about, Cecilia. We just need to wash our hands more.""  But then that failed because her imagination was running. She heard about this thing. And so we're walking down the street in New York. She points at a man, the poor man. ""Does he have the sickness?"" ""Oh, no no no, Cecilia. OK, c'mon. C'mon, sweetie."" ""Does he have the sickness, mom?"" And it continued and continued. And there was that moment. I was like, ""Kate. It is time to call in the experts because this is a new situation.""  Dr. Gupta: So Kate asked her daughters' pediatrician and other experts for advice on how best to talk to her kids about the outbreak. Bolduan: First and foremost, through all my conversations, hours with them, the most important thing that children of all ages need is reassurance. While we don't have all the answers, they need reassurance in this time of uncertainty, that they are going to be OK and that mommy and daddy are likely going to be OK. For older kids, in terms of not avoiding the subject, that may come in the form of addressing misinformation that they are going to hear from their friends or they're going to see on social media. Just having an open dialogue with them, asking them, ""What questions do you have, what are you concerned about?"" For younger kids, they suggested, and I thought this was really fantastic, to start with, just demystifying terms. Dr. Gupta: I love that. That's great. It's educational and yet reassuring at the same time.  Bolduan: Yeah. And they universally said, ""Check yourself first, check your own stress levels first, because just as important as what you were saying to them is how you're acting and how you're saying it to them."" So if you're behaving in a highly stressed manner, your children may simply be picking up on and emulating this behavior. And also then to my obvious faulty start, do not avoid the subject because their lives are being interrupted, just like our lives are being interrupted, and they have questions, and then their imaginations will run wild. Dr. Gupta: School closures can be a nightmare situation for some parents, especially if you're also working at the same time.   Like many parents out there, last week, CNN's senior health producer Nadia Kounang found out her childrens' schools were closing.  Nadia Kounang: In a way, it wasn't surprising because obviously we were reporting that schools were closing, but it's still not quite the same when it happens to you. Like it's just a lot because we have two kids. We have a 4 year old, almost 5 year old and a 7 year old. And I mean, they go to school. And they have childcare, and that's what we rely on so that we can actually go to work. And so it's a lot of hoops that you're thinking about, like, ""How do I work and make sure we're taking care of our kids?"" Dr. Gupta: Nadia is -- like many of you -- juggling multiple jobs right now. She's reporting on the coronavirus while taking care of two young children at home.  Our team visited Nadia and her family at home last week to see how they've been doing.  Kounang: It's challenging, it's been hard to manage. obviously working at CNN covering this, has been really intense on our family. My kids have, whenever they're like, ""Oh, are you working again?"" I'm like, ""Yeah."" They're like, ""Is it because of coronavirus?"" I'm like, ""Yeah."" So that's tough. So that's already hard enough. But this definitely adds a whole other level of pressure. Dr. Gupta: Fortunately for Nadia, a former teacher at Nora's school reached out to families in the neighborhood offering childcare help. Kounang: I think that's the only way it would have worked for us. I mean, we're fortunate we were able to do that. One, we have the funds. Two, we are lucky because there was someone available that had already been vetted and we knew and I felt comfortable with, so that helped.  Dr. Gupta: Even with the extra help, it's been challenging to manage her son Max's home schooling.  Kounang: I don't know if we didn't realize ... Or I don't know what we were supposed to expect. But Max's teacher -- so Max is in first grade -- she e-mailed us this giant schedule. I'll read it to you. But it's crazy. It's like goes from 8:15 to 3:45.  Nadia's husband, Craig Hesterlee: It's their regular school day.  Kounang:  Yeah. I mean, this is a lot of work. We haven't done it that way. We just can't. Like one, I'm not even here. I've had to have someone else help me with that. Dr. Gupta: Nadia says her kids know that school is out because of the coronavirus.   Kounang: I mean, we've talked about it. And it's interesting, I think they've had little lessons at school. They've been much more aware about washing their hands. They're, like, we have to wash for 20 seconds. They know about, like, we have to sing 'Happy Birthday' twice. I wouldn't say they always remember to. But, you know, they're aware of it. I think they've been watching a video about germs. That's what they said.   Dr. Gupta: Not everyone has been able to make it work like Nadia's family.  Kounang: But there's still a large population of kids, I think, who really rely on the school for their services. And there are parents there who, I mean, they work shift jobs, you know, they either ... They have to go into work or maybe they don't have work now ... The other thing is,  they may not have a computer, like the work that we have to do for school relies on us having both a computer or a device of some sort and Internet. What if you don't have that stuff, right?  Randi Weingarten: And frankly, you have a digital divide between wealthy and non-wealthy. Dr. Gupta: Here's Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. Weingarten: So why would you actually think that you're going to replace schooling with online when so many kids at home don't have wi-fi? So we're going to have to just figure out how to help create engagement and how to help create calm and how to get the facts out to help kids as much as possible. Dr. Gupta: But schools -- and communities -- are doing what they can to lift some of the childcare and financial load.    Arne Duncan: Schools aren't just schools, they're amazing social safety nets, and over 30 million students rely on schools for their meals. Dr. Gupta: CNN spoke to Arne Duncan, the former Education Secretary under President Obama.  Duncan: And so we have places like here in Chicago giving out 100,000 meals. You have in LA distribution centers around the city where they're feeding kids. We're now working on the learning part, and you're seeing some very different things. You're seeing high-tech and low-tech. In places like Cleveland, you're seeing it on bus routes, the people dropping off both food and homework.  Dr. Gupta: He says he's been seeing a lot of great leadership and creativity on the local and state level. Duncan: You're seeing in places like Miami, where every child has a device in their -- a little bit farther ahead, some very good blended learning going on there. You're seeing school districts from Indiana to Utah, where there isn't access to wi-fi, wi-fi enabled buses being parked in those neighborhoods to close that digital divide. So you're seeing amazing creativity, you see people working really hard.  Dr. Gupta: Again, I want to be really careful because there's people who are legitimately suffering out there, for sure, but the reality is that these things are unfolding in front of us in real time. And for my girls, you know, it's going to be one of the most significant events in their lives. My 11-year-old's birthday was this past Monday. And she was upset because we canceled her party. But we still spent time together as a family -- we went for a walk outside -- and while she didn't get her party, I reminded her it's a birthday she'll never forget.    We'll be back tomorrow.

98,CNN,"Dr. Gupta: Question 1.  Listener: If a person gets the coronavirus and it's a mild case and they recover, does that person then have immunity from the disease in the future?  Dr. Gupta: This is a really important question.   There were some early reports in Japan and China of people becoming reinfected, but researchers looked into that and they think that wasn't actually what was happening.  It's possible that those people never fully cleared the virus. In some people, the virus can stay in the body, even after they're no longer showing symptoms.    I wanted to be sure of this, so during our CNN Town Hall, I asked Dr. Anthony Fauci, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and this is what he said: Dr. Anthony Fauci: If this virus acts like any other virus that we've had any experience with, once you get infected and recover from that infection, your body will mount a response that will protect you from reexposure and rechallenge with that exact virus.  If you get infected with the novel coronavirus and you recover, you can be pretty certain that you're protected against reinfection.   Dr. Gupta: Now there's no definitive study on this, but Dr. Fauci has been dealing with viruses his entire professional life, so I believe him when he says that it's very unlikely that you'll get the virus again.  Listener: My name is Jasmine. And my question for you is, can young people get really sick from the virus?  Dr. Gupta: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention came out with a report last week that showed young adults between the ages of 20 and 44 were making up to 20% of coronavirus hospitalizations.   And almost half the patients who were admitted to the ICU were adults under the age of 64.   Now it didn't say whether those patients had any underlying risks, so it's not clear if these young adults were more vulnerable to the infection than others.    The risk of dying is still much higher in older people, but this new study is important because it shows that adults of all ages are at risk of getting really sick.  Listener: How long are you contagious if you've recovered from the virus?  Dr. Gupta: This one is a case-by-case basis.   The CDC guidelines say that if you're not showing symptoms, like a cough or fever; and if you've been tested negative on at least two consecutive tests taken a day apart; then you're not at risk of infecting others.  Now, if you've been in self isolation at home, you should consult your doctor before you make any decisions to come out of isolation and start interacting with anyone else.  Listener: My husband and I have a son, a 16-month-old, and we were gonna start trying for a second one in April. And we were wondering if there's any good reason for us to delay trying to get pregnant?   Dr. Gupta: This is a tough question that ultimately has to be your decision.     Let me tell you what I know. At this point it's not clear that pregnant women have a higher risk of getting sicker from the coronavirus. We also don't know if it would cause problems during the pregnancy or affect the baby.   But we do know pregnant women are more vulnerable to other respiratory illnesses like the flu.  There was a recent study of nine women who were infected with the virus, and none of their babies were affected by it.    Listener: Should ibuprofen and anti-inflammatories in general be avoided if you have coronavirus?      Dr. Gupta: I've heard this question a lot.   There's some merit to this concern. Anti-inflammatories can sometimes suppress your immune system.    The FDA says they're not aware of any evidence saying that ibuprofen makes coronavirus symptoms worse.   But it can reduce your ability to fight off an infection.   For healthy people, it's not enough of a decrease -- it will hardly make a dent. But if you have a weakened immune system or an underlying condition, it's better to take Tylenol.  Thank you everyone for all your questions.

102,CNN,"While there are reasonable debates to be had about the fairest fair way to go forward, from what I can tell, too few schools have taken this seemingly radical step. For many, assessing and ranking students feels essential to the function of a university. Strong students want grades as markers of their success. But in this moment of crisis, we're all just going to have to relax and accept that the chaotic world we're living in right now demands a different approach.   At their best, grades are not in fact always all that useful; often, they reveal as much about the conditions in which a student is able to work as their raw ability or effort. I spent a decade teaching first-generation students -- often also first-generation Americans -- at a small college in Chicago. Many were brilliant. Many also had to care for younger members of their family, work 30-40 hours a week and often experienced both food and housing insecurity. They didn't always do their best work, because life got in their way. I learned to shift my standards, not by lowering them exactly, but to emphasize growth and intention over flawless execution. I tried to let empathy moderate the pursuit of rigor and perfection in which I had been trained. Through a pedagogy of kindness and trust, I helped my students achieve great things; they often exceeded my highest expectations. We're all going to need to prioritize empathy, kindness and trust as we move through the next few weeks and maybe months. Students are going through profound dislocations because of the coronavirus pandemic and simply cannot be expected to do good work while moving, being isolated, shifting to online learning and other changes. This is as true for younger students as for those in college or graduate school, and we're just going to have to take that into account. Faculty also need to be judged on a pass/fail basis. Online teaching is uniquely hard and cannot be mastered as a skill in a couple of hours or days. Student evaluations -- which for pre-tenure or pre-promotion faculty are vitally important to their career advancement -- will be useless in this new arrangement, as will any evaluations of research productivity.  This is also true in nearly every industry. Every resume, transcript, curriculum vitae and work history is going to look weird when it comes to spring 2020. At large companies, employees typically get assessed annually based on their ability to meet performance goals. Those goals should be thrown away and every employee treated (as Facebook has reportedly done) as if they ""exceed expectations"" across categories. Anyone who shows up and tries to keep going should get an A+. College admissions officers and hiring managers alike take note: We should all get maximum credit for just making it through the spring intact. And if we need to go pass/fail in all of our work and education, we need it even more in our home life. Relationships will get strained. None of us will always be able to practice optimal parenting strategies, especially as parents figure out how to balance working from home and caring for our kids at the same time. My children are on iPads even as I write this, though allegedly my daughter is playing a math game.  It's not that we have to look the other way on abuse or neglect, but competency rather than excellence should be the goal. This is also true when we judge ourselves. I'd love to think that in the next few weeks I'm going to rewrite my novel and draft multiple chapters of my history book, all while continuing to make pasta from scratch and providing excellent advising to my students whenever they need it. More realistically, let's just try to keep our productivity and relationships at what in other times we might have rated a B-, while hoping for better, and weathering this storm with maximum compassion for ourselves and everyone around us.  With one exception: Our leaders do not get this benefit of the doubt, because our lives are at stake. Turning us into a pass/fail nation is about lowering anxiety and giving our leaders time to make up for the weeks in which the Trump administration downplayed the threat. Much of what's happening now was in fact predicted and the worst consequences might have been avoided. So while teachers, provosts, deans, principals, managers and executives need to send the message that those they supervise can relax a little, we need to send the exact opposite message to those in power. You will not be graded on a curve."

107,CNN,"Trump's focus -- as it has been since nearly the start of this virus -- is on proving that he did the right thing by limiting arrivals from China and, as of Wednesday night, from Europe as well. As for his claim that his moves have ""helped us save thousands of lives,"" that is a very hard thing to fact-check. 3. ""But it'll be -- it'll go very quickly."" There's no indication that coronavirus will ""go very quickly."" None.  4. ""We'll be discussing some other moves that we're going to be making. And I think it's going to work out very well for everybody."" Well, I'm convinced! 5. ""And they're -- they're doing a very good job. They don't have very much infection at this point, and hopefully they'll keep it that way."" The United Kingdom, to which Trump is referring here, has 373 cases, according to the World Health Organization. That's many more than other European countries where Trump has banned travel. 6. ""Well, we get along very well with the European leaders, but we had to make a decision and I didn't want to take time -- and, you know, it takes a long time to make the individual calls"" ""World leaders have long mocked each other. With Trump, they mean it."" -- The Washington Post 7. ""In the case of European Union, I've consulted with many people."" Literally, what does this mean? 8. ""And the same people, then they say, oh, he closed too fast, why did he close -- most of them said, why did he close with China? That turned out to be a great move."" Again, Trump wants to ensure people know he deserves credit for closing travel to China. That's the key takeaway here. Not the impact the coronavirus is having in the United States. 9. ""When you think of what happened to Europe, because it was very fast and very furious."" [Vin Diesel nods knowingly] 10. ""You know, you see what's going on. And so I just wanted that to stop as it pertains to the United States. And that's what we've done. We've stopped it."" [narrator voice] We haven't. Not even close. 11. ""We have a big one in Tampa, all sold out. We had over 100,000 requests for tickets. But I think we'll probably not do it because people would say it's better to not do."" The question here was what Trump planned to do about campaign rallies, given the warnings about the need to avoid large crowds in spreading the coronavirus. The President turned it into a chance to brag about how many tickets were requested for a rally. So, yeah. 12. ""And what is the number as of this morning? Is it 32? You could tell me. Is it 32 deaths, Steve, around that?"" The President of the United States is unaware of how many Americans have died as a result of coronavirus. Indefensible. (At the moment, 38 people have passed away in the US from coronavirus.) 13. ""I mean, think of it, the United States, because of what I did and what the administration did with China, we have 32 deaths at this point."" It's 38. And it was 38 when Trump said this. 14. ""Other countries, that are smaller countries, have many, many deaths. Thirty-two is a lot. Thirty-two is too many. But when you look at the kind of numbers that you're seeing coming out of other countries, it's pretty amazing, when you think of it."" Yes, he is patting himself on the back. And yes, he is wrong about the number of deaths. And yes, this quote is literally whatever the opposite of empathy is. 15. ""We have very strong emergency powers under the Stafford Act. And we are -- we haven't -- I mean, I have it memorized, practically, as to the powers in that act."" The Stafford Act allows, among other things, a president to declare a disaster, a move that frees up federal resources to deal with something like the coronavirus. It is 192 pages long. President Trump has it memorized. 16.  ""I have the right to do a lot of things that people don't even know about."" Well, this isn't ominous at all! 17. ""Look, we're in -- we're in great shape; compared to other places, we are in really good shape. And we want to keep it that way. That's why I did the ban with respect to Europe."" ""There's little value to European travel restrictions. Poor use of time & energy. Earlier, yes. Now, travel restrictions/screening are less useful. We have nearly as much disease here in the US as the countries in Europe. We MUST focus on layered community mitigation measures-Now!"" -- Former Trump administration Department of Homeland Security adviser Tom Bossert 18. ""You have to remember, the stock market, as an example, is still much higher than when I got here."" As of noon Eastern time Thursday, 83% of the gains the stock market had made since Trump came into office had been wiped out by fears over the pandemic's effect on the world economy, according to The New York Times' Peter Baker. 19.  ""We love the Irish."" Okey-doke! 20. ""People have -- you know, we call it cases, how many cases do you have. Well, relative to other countries, we have very few cases, relative to certain of the -- of the major countries that really have a bigger problem than us."" ""We call it cases."" 21. ""Let's put it this way, I'm not concerned, OK?"" In which the President dismisses questions about the fact that he was photographed over the weekend with a Brazilian press aide who has been diagnosed with the coronavirus. Sure. OK. 22. ""They have a million tests out now. They're going to have, over the next few days, they're going to have 4 million tests out. And frankly, the testing has been going very smooth."" ""The idea of anybody getting it easily, the way people in other countries are doing it, we're not set up for that. Do I think we should be? Yes. But we're not. That is a failing. It is a failing. Let's admit it."" -- Dr. Anthony Fauci, today 23. ""We're doing it the opposite, we're very much ahead of everything."" Simply not true. 24. ""Well, I think the Democrats won't be having rallies, but nobody showed up to their rallies anyway, so what difference does it make?"" Very ""modern-day presidential"" stuff here. Very. 25. ""My rallies are very big. They're very big rallies, and we'll be making a decision at the appropriate time."" Right. You said that already. 26  ""And I don't want people dying. That's what I'm all about."" When people ask me what I am all about in the future, I am going to say: ""I don't want people dying. That's what I'm all about."" 27. ""So I had to make that decision, and frankly, the people that are professionals praise the decision, and it's something I had to do, and I think you'll see the end result is very good because of it."" Trump's decisions are, according to Trump, a) praised by ""professionals"" and b) will look even better sometime very soon. 28. ""I used to be in the real estate business, as you've probably heard. They built some really -- and I -- I built beautiful buildings, and they've built some really beautiful buildings."" So, canceling the Olympics in Japan would be bad because of all the beautiful buildings that had been built. As always, laser-focused on what's important! 29. ""Some areas have no problem whatsoever, in our country, and others do."" As of Thursday afternoon, 44 US states had confirmed coronavirus cases. 30. ""You see what they're doing in New Rochelle, which is -- which is good, frankly, it's the right thing. But it's not enforced, it's not very strong but people know they're -- they're being watched, New Rochelle, that's a hot spot."" Yeah, this feels like a good place to end."
108,CNN,"You know, the movement started basically with me, and I think what happened, you know, I was the first example, and now there are thousands of men who are being accused and a regeneration of things that I think none of us understood. I think that -- I can't help looking at Jessica and Mimi and hope that something of our old friendship in me could emerge, but I'm sure like me, they have lawyers who say to them be careful of what you say. I read, you know, those letters where people talked about, you know, missing you, loving you, that kind of thing. As you know, having a serious friendship, that is what I believe that I had with Mimi and Jessica. You know, I really, really was maybe hypnotic and under that impression that I had that feeling, that I had that relationship. That five years with Jessica and the years that I knew Mimi were always filled with, don't go on the plane Harv, I want to have dinner with you first from Mimi. Or, Harv, whatever, let's get,you know, can you look at this idea I have for a television series. Or Harv, I'm in Cannes, can I go to the premier. Or Jessica, can I get into the Soho Club, which is a very exclusive, tough place to get into. But she needed it for herself. I got her a job at the Peninsula Hotel which she excelled at for awhile. I'm not going to say these aren't great people, I had wonderful times with these people, you know. It is just I'm totally confused and I think men are confused about all of these issues. You know, I just -- dealing with the thousands of men and women who are losing due process, I'm worried about this country in a sense too. I'm worried there is a repeat of the blacklist there was in the 1950's when lots of men like myself, Dalton Trumbo, one of the great examples, did not work, went to jail because people thought they were communists. You know, there was a scare, and that is what happened, and I think that is what is happening now all over this country. Two years ago, we wrote a letter to 15 friends, I think, the ADA quoted part of it, but the part of it that was the most important part was I'm a builder, I know how to build, and I know how to generate, you know, things on a charitable nature, and I know how to pass my success forward. I think even Mimi and Jessica would say that I was generous, you know, in that part of the relationship. The thing that I wanted to do in that letter was I wanted to build a hospital, but not a hospital like the regular hospital, a hospital that deals with this, rehabilitation and redemption; people losing their jobs over the fact they testified for me, or people being afraid to testify that they will lose their jobs. That is not the right atmosphere for this United States of America. It is wrong, you know, and that is what is happening. Everybody is on some sort of blacklist. I had no great powers in this industry. Miramax, at the height of its fame, was a smaller company than by far any Walt Disney, any Sony, Paramount. I could not blackball anybody, because if I said don't use that actress, the guys at Warner Brothers would say I'm going to use it to ... spite that bastard, whatever. That is what it was. But it became blown up like power, power, power. I was not about power, I was about making great movies, I was a perfectionist, and I think I drove myself crazy. I'm not going to also run away from what the District Attorney said about some of the things I did say. I had a fight with my brother, yes, people said I said bad things to people, but there are so many people, thousands of people who would say great things about me. Sixty executives in this industry were trained by me. They are at the top of their field. They were running studios in top positions in this country. When I was an assistant at Paramount, they said if you are five minutes late, don't come in, or they would black me the whole day. There never was in our industry a book that said this is how it should be. We always passed it on from assistant to assistant. An assistant was almost like if you were my assistant, it was like going to the Marine Corps, I mean could you survive two years with me and then become an executive. And those two years were tough, and I admit it. If I had to do it over again, I would not do it that way. If I had to do a lot of things over, I would care less about the movies and care more about my children, family, and other people and friends and other people in this life. The thing for me is I have not seen my three older children since the newspaper, since the New Yorker article came out; not the New York Times, but the New Yorker article, so I have not seen them. I just have no idea what they are doing, and I'm in no communication with them, that for me is hell on earth. I just think my empathy has grown over the last 2-1/2 years. I can look at everybody there, you know, and just say, you know, I understand things, I empathize, I feel things, and I was not that person until this crisis started. I have to just say that. I mean that part of this is such a tough process and has come out where I have learned so many things. I never thought I could deal with or things I dealt with in Arizona. I said, I'll build this hospital blah, blah, blah. I said to two 15-year-olds what would you name the hospital, they said the Wonder Woman Hospital. I said you have to think of like a Greek God. He said Athena. Those two 15-year-olds, because they were all part of this group, were hooked on opiates and whatever, and you know, prostituting themselves to make money for it. I met all sorts of people and I have grown. For me, the idea of perfection in art and business is over. My mission is to help people. And I also want to make one clear statement. My wife Eve (my first wife) and my wife Georgina knew nothing about this. I went to extraordinary lengths to hide my extramarital affairs; that was a terrible thing that I did by having those extramarital affairs, and God knows if I could take it back, I would. I know everybody in this room feels the same way. It had nothing to do with anything. I was unfaithful to both, and I just cannot tell you how bad I feel about that. You know, I never see my children again and they are everything to me in this world. You know, when I deal with subjects like this, I don't wish for vengeance, I wish for understanding. That is why I wanted to build a hospital. I wanted to build a hospital where if somebody is accused of something, they work, women, men, me too, they work with accredited groups that come in and help them and help them grow. You know, I wanted to testify, but they told me all these things the District Attorney just said would come in my way before I testified. I wanted to talk to everybody, but anyhow, they all came up as it is. Now you should know some of the other side of that because I recognized the voices in those. One of those voices, one -- I lost my train of thought. I just recognized some of the names who complained, but what was known about me was with the toughness came the kindness, the person who probably hates me the most in this world, their daughter has a situation where she needs the help of a great doctor. I got her that doctor. That doctor is there to date with her. Her father could not get that doctor. This is the person who hates me the most in this company. When his mother was sick I helped him with a doctor too. There was not any request that I refused on the part of the people who worked with me. As far as the million dollars is concerned, I wrote a check out from the company, but I reimbursed the company because that is the way we did it. That million dollars was mine and I will say that over and over again. 9/11 happened, and I woke up two days later, I called John Seiss, I said we have to do something for New York, not only for the money, but for the attitude. We raised $100 million dollars free of expenses. Ask the police who got that money. Ask the firemen if they respect me. Ask the workers if they respect me, and most of all, ask the victims of 9/11 who received $35 million dollars of that $100 million dollars if they respect me. You know, when you want to investigate, take both sides into the equation, then when Sandy happened and people lost their jobs, and people lost their houses, again, we went to the board and we raised $77 million dollars. Ask the guy in Coney Island, ask the guy in Far Rockaway when he lost his business and we were able to walk in there and save his business; ask him if he likes me. Ask the captain who was killed in action. I took his children to the Super Bowl and to the Academy Awards because somebody had to do it. I did it with Steve Tisch. There are so many examples of that. Robin Hood (Foundation) raised $2.5 billion dollars for the children and people of New York City. We built schools, built advocacy groups. I'm not saying I was a great part of it, but I was one of the board there and 22 years, and I had a lot to say and a lot to do. (Paul Tudor) Jones was the one who deserved the credit, but $2.5 billion dollars to build schools. I showed it by my work. You can't achieve what we achieved at AmFar. You cannot achieve what we achieved at AmFar without doing the hard work, getting the people, and we raised $170 million dollars and I started with AmFar. People would not touch each other, like the virus today, people would not touch each other. They were scared of AIDS and there were three hundred people who raised $300,000 the first night. The year I left AmFar, we raised $30 million dollars and $170 million dollars overall. I worked too hard. As a result of working too hard, I felt too much pressure on myself. I really feel the remorse of this situation, I feel it deeply in my heart. I feel emotional, I feel like to go and talk to you guys, you know, just really, really caring and really trying and really trying to be a better person. Thank you, your Honor, for the time."

112,CNN,"2. ""Just so you understand, now it's all performing perfectly."" Trump is talking about the testing for coronavirus happening at the CDC. But in truth, this could be Trump talking about anything having to do with the virus. Or not! 3. ""No, it's performing very well, and it has been performing very well."" Uh huh. (See No. 1.) 4. ""But we're also considering the fact that last year we had approximately 36,000 deaths due to what's called the flu."" ""What's called the flu."" 5. ""As of the time I left the plane with you, we had 240 cases. That's at least what was on a very fine network known as Fox News. And you love it. But that's what I happened to be watching. And how was the show last night? Did it get good ratings, by the way?"" In which the President of the United States transitions from the number of Americans who have been sickened by the coronavirus to the TV ratings from his town hall interview on Fox News. Sure! Very normal! 6. ""I heard it broke all ratings records, but maybe that's wrong. That's what they told me. I don't know. I can't imagine that."" Yes, Trump is focused on whether his appearance on Fox ""broke all ratings records."" And also yes, he is at the CDC, surrounded by experts in infectious disease addressing a growing public health crisis. 7. ""And I've heard the numbers are getting much better in China, but I hear the numbers are getting much better in Italy, et cetera, et cetera."" Less than 48 hours after Trump said this, coronavirus cases -- and deaths -- spiked in Italy, causing the country's government to issue a lockdown of northern Italy. 8. ""But over the last long period of time, when people have the flu, you have an average of 36,000 people dying. I've never heard those numbers. I would -- I would've been shocked. I would've said, 'Does anybody die from the flu?' I didn't know people died from the flu -- 36,000 people died."" The President of the United States was, until very recently, unaware that anyone died from the flu. So, yeah. 9. ""I don't watch CNN. That's why I don't recognize you.""  [narrator voice] He does watch CNN. 10. ""I really don't -- I don't watch it. I don't watch CNN because CNN is fake news."" Again, he does. 11. ""I think people are staying in the United States more. They're going to spend their money in the United States. And then this is ended. It will end."" OK, so the economic impact of coronavirus on the US will be a net positive then? [checks stock market, frowns] 12. ""I do think that if you look at the numbers and you look at the numbers from other years on other things, and you look at these numbers, it'll be interesting to see what you find."" He's talking about the number of people sickened or killed by the coronavirus. I think. 13. ""People have to feel comfortable to have a good time."" So true! 14. ""We've had 11 deaths, and they've been largely old people who are -- who were susceptible to what's happening."" Within the next few days, the death toll from coronavirus in the United States doubled. 15. ""You know, I'm a person that was never big on the hand-shaking deal throughout my life. They used to criticize me for it or laugh about it or have fun with it."" ""The Purell presidency: Trump aides learn the president's real red line"" -- Politico, 2017 16. ""The fact is I feel very secure. I feel very secure."" Life goals. 17. ""I haven't had any problems filling them. I mean, we just had one in North Carolina, South Carolina -- all over the place. And we have tens of thousands of people standing outside the arena."" The question Trump was asked was whether he had any concerns about holding big campaign rallies given warning about the community spread of coronavirus. His answer? His rallies are packed. So, yeah. 18. ""Anybody that wants a test can get a test. That's what the bottom line is."" ""You may not get a test unless a doctor or public health official prescribes a test."" -- Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar 19. ""They have the tests. And the tests are beautiful. Anybody that needs a test gets a test."" What would you say are the traits of a ""beautiful"" test for coronavirus? 20. ""But as of right now and yesterday, anybody that needs a test -- that's the important thing -- and the tests are all perfect, like the letter was perfect. The transcription was perfect, right? This was not as perfect as that, but pretty good."" So, the coronavirus test is perfect just like Trump's July 2019 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was perfect? Or the transcription of that call, which was not a transcript at all. If this doesn't worry you, you aren't paying attention. 21. ""I'd rather have the people stay, but I'd go with them. I told them to make the final decision. I would rather -- because I like the numbers being where they are. I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship."" The President openly acknowledges here that the reason he wants the people on the cruise ship off California to stay there is not for any medical reason but because he wants to keep the number of reported coronavirus cases (artificially) low. This is nuts. 22. ""No, I like the numbers. I would rather have the numbers stay where they are. But if they want to take them off, they'll take them off. But if that happens, all of a sudden your 240 is obviously going to be a much higher number, and probably the 11 will be a higher number too."" [head explodes] 23. ""You know, my uncle was a great person. He was at MIT. He taught at MIT for, I think, like a record number of years. He was a great super genius. Dr. John Trump."" How did Trump get on this subject, you ask? I have absolutely no idea. He was praising NIH for how they are handling the coronavirus outbreak and then -- whammo -- Dr. John Trump, ""super genius."" 24. ""I like this stuff. I really get it. People are surprised that I understand it. Every one of these doctors said, 'How do you know so much about this?' Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for President."" This is a real quote from the President of the United States. What more is there to say. 25. ""So I told Mike not to be complimentary to the governor because that governor is a snake."" Vice President Mike Pence praised Washington Gov. Jay Inslee for how he is handling the coronavirus in his state. Trump called Inslee a ""snake."" This feels like a good place to end."
113,CNN,"""Bernie is proud of so many of the accomplishments of President Obama and his administration, which is why he fought hard to protect the Affordable Care Act and the Iran nuclear deal from Donald Trump's attacks,"" Casca told CNN in an email. Sanders underperformed in a series of contests last week that saw former Vice President Joe Biden surging. After years of criticism, Sanders and his campaign are now trying to signal they are aligned with Obama in an ad unveiled after Super Tuesday that features the former president praising him in 2016 and 2006. The ad, however, lacks context, according to a recent CNN fact check.  In the ad, Obama praised Sanders for having ""the virtue of saying exactly what he believes. Great authenticity, great passion, and is fearless,"" though a transcript of the comments shows the ad omits Obama's admission that he didn't know Sanders as well since he didn't serve in his administration.  Obama also exclaimed, ""Feel the Bern!"" at the end of the ad, suggesting a possible endorsement from Obama. However, the exclamation was said at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in an effort to get Sanders' supporters to vote for Clinton. Obama has not endorsed anyone in the 2020 election.  The ad now signals a new direction for the Sanders campaign as it seeks to stop Biden's momentum from clinching the Democratic nomination.  Even when defending Obama during his presidency, Sanders argued he wasn't a huge supporter of Obama. ""I'm not Obama's biggest fan,"" Sanders said on HBO's ""Real Time with Bill Maher"" in April 2013. ""I supported him, I'm an independent, but I'm critical of many aspects.""  Sanders, who worked with Obama on a host of issues, maintained that Obama was not a progressive, but instead a centrist in the Democratic Party. He said Obama hadn't stood up to extremism in the Republican Party.  ""I think he's a pretty honest guy and the President as you may recall just a few weeks ago, said that if we were in the 1980s he would have been considered something like a moderate Republican,"" Sanders said on WNYC in 2013 after Obama had been elected to a second term. ""And I think he's kind of a centrist somewhere in the middle of the Democratic Party. But no, I don't think he is a progressive."" ""I was very disappointed in terms of his unwillingness to be more aggressive in standing up to what has increasingly become a right wing extremist Republican Party,"" Sanders added. ""And he really hasn't, to my mind, done that effectively.""  Speaking on CNN's ""Crossfire"" in 2013, Sanders' critiqued Obamacare, saying, though he voted for it, he wouldn't argue with someone who said it was too complicated.  ""Let me be very clear,"" Sanders said. ""I voted for Obamacare. But to be very honest with you, I'm not going to argue with anybody who says that it is too complicated. I am an advocate of a 'Medicare for All' single payer program. I think Obamacare is a good Republican Romney type program, which has worked in Massachusetts. It's a moderate program which addresses some needs."" One of Obama's biggest mistakes as president, Sanders said in September 2011, was abandoning his grassroots supporters and not following through on his campaign promises.  ""In terms of Wall Street, in terms of the economy, in terms of taxes, terms of civil liberties, the President has clearly been disappointing to many people and nowhere near as strong as we had hoped that he would be,"" Sanders said.  ""I believe he ran one of the greatest campaigns that I've ever seen in my lifetime. He inspired people, galvanized people, brought people together,"" he added. ""But for whatever reasons, he has not followed through with a lot of the issues that he discussed in his campaign and I think has not stood up to the right wing extremism that is so potent in Washington right now. And the answer was what you're asking is what do we do? Well, the only thing that I know to do is to rally the American people around the progressive agenda.""  This story has been updated with additional comment from the Sanders campaign."
114,CNN,Thank you for using CNN 10
115,CNN,"Facts First: At the time Hunter Biden was appointed to the board of Burisma in 2014, he was a lawyer at the firm Boies Schiller Flexner, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University's foreign service program, chairman of the board of World Food Program USA, and chief executive officer and chairman of Rosemont Seneca Advisors, an investment advisory firm. He also served on other boards. At CNN, we start with the facts. Visit CNN's home for Facts First. Before Joe Biden became vice president in 2009, Hunter Biden, a lawyer who graduated from Yale Law School, worked as a lobbyist. He became a partner at a law and lobbying firm in 2001. (He stopped lobbying late in the 2008 election.) Before that, he had worked for financial services company MBNA, rising to senior vice president and worked for the US Commerce Department.  None of this is to say that Hunter Biden's name was not a factor in the Burisma appointment; Hunter Biden has acknowledged that he would ""probably not"" have been asked to be on the board if he were not a Biden. But Trump's repeat portrayal of him as a pitiful unemployed man is inaccurate. Unemployment in Pennsylvania and Scranton  Trump claimed that ""this area of Pennsylvania, and Pennsylvania itself, has the best numbers it's ever had. It's got the best economy it's ever had. It has the best unemployment numbers it's ever had. And Scranton has the lowest and best unemployment numbers they've -- and employment numbers too -- that they've ever had, by far."" Facts First: Neither the unemployment rate for Pennsylvania nor the unemployment rate for the Scranton area is at its lowest level ever. And both rates have crept higher over the past several months.  The Pennsylvania state unemployment rate was at 4.5% in December 2019, worse than the best rates under presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. (The rate increased steadily in 2019 from the 3.8% rate in of April, May and June, which was the state's lowest rate since at least 1976.) The December 2019 unemployment rate for the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre/Hazleton area was 5.6% -- worse than various rates under Clinton and Bush and also worse than the rate in Obama's last full month in office, 5.4% in December 2016. It hit 4.0% in April 2019, which was the lowest for the area since at least 1990.) The coronavirus Trump claimed, ""We got hit with the virus really three weeks ago, if you think about it, I guess. That's when we first started really to see some possible effects.""  Facts First: The US had its first confirmed case of the coronavirus on January 21, more than six weeks before Trump spoke here, so it's not true that the US had not really seen even ""some possible effects"" until three weeks ago.  Obama and coronavirus testing Trump repeated his claim that he had reversed an Obama-era decision that had somehow impeded testing for the coronavirus, saying, ""They made some decisions which were not good decisions.  We inherited decisions that they made, and that's fine ... We undid some of the regulations that were made that made it very difficult, but I'm not blaming anybody."" Facts First: There is no regulation from President Barack Obama that impeded coronavirus testing. The Obama administration did put forward a draft proposal related to lab testing, but it was never implemented. When asked what Obama administration decision Trump might be referring to, Peter Kyriacopolous, chief policy officer at the Association of Public Health Laboratories, said: ""We aren't sure what rule is being referenced."" Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, who was principal deputy commissioner of the FDA under Obama and is now professor of the practice at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said, ""There wasn't a policy that was put into place that inhibited them. There was no Obama policy they were reversing."" Obama and Kim Jong Un Trump claimed Obama called North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ""many times"" but ""Kim Jong Un did not want to talk to him. And me, he wanted to talk to.""  Facts First: There is no evidence that Obama called Kim even once. ""This is a total fabrication,"" Susan Rice, who served as Obama's national security adviser, said on Twitter in response to a previous version of this Trump claim. There's also no evidence for Trump's previous claim that Obama begged Kim for a meeting. An LNG plant in Louisiana Trump claimed ""I opened up LNG plants in Louisiana"" where companies had been unable to get permits for ""for 10, 12, 14 years and longer."" He said, ""I got them built, a $10 billion plant in Louisiana.""  Facts First: The $10 billion LNG facility Trump visited in Louisiana in 2019 was granted its key permits under Obama, and its construction also began under Obama. Federal regulators have approved other multi-billion-dollar LNG facilities for Louisiana under Trump, but they had not been waiting anywhere close to 10 or 14 years for approval. The whistleblower Trump called the whistleblower who complained about his dealings with Ukraine a ""phony whistleblower"" and claimed this person had described ""a call that didn't exist.""  Facts First: The whistleblower's account of Trump's July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been proven substantially accurate. In fact, the rough transcript Trump released showed that the whistleblower's three primary allegations about the call were correct or very close to correct. You can read a full fact check here. Court vacancies Trump claimed President Barack Obama left him ""142 openings"" on the courts, in part because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell -- who thwarted many of Obama's judicial nominees -- did a ""great job.""  Facts First: This is Trump's usual exaggerated figure. There were 104 court vacancies on January 1, 2017, 19 days before Trump took office, according to Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks judicial appointments. The history of court vacancies Trump claimed that ""normally,"" presidents are left no court vacancies at all; ""if you have one,"" he said, it's ""lucky.""  Facts First: It is standard for presidents to inherit dozens of vacancies. According to Wheeler, there were 53 vacancies on January 1, 2009, just before Obama took office; 80 vacancies on January 1, 2001, just before George W. Bush took office; 107 vacancies on January 1, 1993, just before Bill Clinton took office. The Mexican border Trump claimed that ""we have right now 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our border.""  Facts First: Mexico has deployed around 27,000 troops, but Trump exaggerated how many are being stationed near the US border in particular; Mexico's defense minister said in October that it was about 15,000 on the US border, about 12,000 on Mexico's own southern border. The Soviet Union and Afghanistan Talking about the history of war in Afghanistan, Trump claimed the Soviet Union ""became Russia because of Afghanistan.""  Facts First: This was an exaggeration. Experts say the Soviet Union's failed Afghanistan War was far from the only reason for its collapse, though the war did contribute. Pre-existing conditions Trump claimed that ""pre-existing conditions, 100%, we take care of.""  Facts First: Trump administration has repeatedly supported bills that would weaken Obamacare's protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Trump is currently supporting a Republican lawsuit that is seeking to declare all of Obamacare void. He has not issued a plan to reinstate the law's protections for people with pre-existing conditions if the suit succeeds, though he promised again at the town hall that Republicans would have one. Tariffs on China Trump claimed, ""China is paying us billions and billions of dollars because of what I did to them with tariffs.""  Facts First: Study after study has shown that Americans are bearing the vast majority of the cost of the tariffs. And it is Americans who make the actual tariff payments. Air quality Trump said he wants the US to have the world's cleanest air and water, then claimed, ""Our conditions now are much better than they were three years ago.""  Facts First: By several measures, US air was cleaner under Obama than it has been under Trump. Three of the six types of pollutants identified by the Clean Air Act as toxic to human health were more prevalent in the air as of 2018 than they were before Trump took office, according to Environmental Protection Agency data. There were more ""unhealthy air days"" for sensitive groups in 2018 than in 2016, and researchers from Carnegie Mellon University who studied Environmental Protection Agency data found that air pollution increased between 2016 and 2018. Here are some claims that were not flat false but were lacking some key context: The visa lottery Asked about illegal immigration, Trump brought up ""loopholes"" like how ""they pick lotteries, and they have people coming into our country.""  Facts First: Trump was vague here, but he suggested -- as he has previously claimed explicitly -- that it is foreign countries, ""they,"" who conduct lotteries for immigration to the US. The lottery for US green cards is conducted by the US State Department, not by other governments. Southwest border apprehensions Speaking about immigration, Trump said that it has now been ""nine or 10 months where the numbers are way down.""  Facts First: After eight consecutive months of declines, the number of Border Patrol arrests on the southern border increased from 29,200 in January to 30,068 in February, the government confirmed earlier in the day of Trump's town hall. The numbers are still down from last year, and the announcement of the increase was only hours old, so we'll give Trump some leeway. The military and ammunition Trump told a story about how the military was so ""depleted"" under Obama and Biden that a general advised him against some sort of military action because ""we have no ammunition.""  Facts First: We don't know what a general may or may not have told Trump, but it's clearly not true that the world's most powerful military had ""no ammunition"" at any point under Obama or Trump. According to military officials, there was a shortfall in certain kinds of munitions, particularly precision-guided bombs, late in the Obama presidency and early in the Trump presidency. It has never been clear how dire the shortfall was. You can read a full fact check here. A Gallup poll Trump touted a Gallup poll in which he said he was given ""tremendous marks"" for his handling of the coronavirus.  Facts First: The poll was positive for Trump, as 77% percent of respondents in that poll did say they had confidence in the federal government's ability to handle a coronavirus outbreak. But here's some important context: the poll did not ask about Trump in particular. The poll asked about confidence in the government's future acts, not about its actual work to date and, critically, it was conducted from February 3-16, when there were far fewer reported cases and Trump was still, at minimum, 10 days away from appointing Vice President Mike Pence as his point man on the response. This story has been updated to include an additional claim by Trump about Obama and coronavirus testing."

118,CNN,"The ad begins with Obama saying, in a voiceover, ""Bernie is somebody who has the virtue of saying exactly what he believes. Great authenticity, great passion, and is fearless."" At CNN, we start with the facts. Visit CNN's home for Facts First. Obama did say those words, in a January 2016 interview with Politico. But he also said other words in the middle, which the ad omits.  In the full quote, Obama made clear that he doesn't know Sanders as well as Sanders' then-rival, Hillary Clinton.  According to the Politico transcript, the full quote is: ""Bernie is somebody who -- although I don't know as well because he wasn't, obviously, in my administration -- has the virtue of saying exactly what he believes, and great authenticity, great passion, and is fearless."" 2) Another quote is from 2006, not 2016 After an additional quote from the 2016 Politico interview, in which Obama noted that Sanders ""got bills done"" while serving on the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, the ad proceeds to Obama saying this: ""I think people are ready for a call to action. They want honest leadership who cares about them. They want somebody who's gonna fight for them. And they will find it in Bernie."" The ad then cuts to a shot of Obama at the podium at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, where Obama says, ""That's right. Feel the Bern!"" The concluding image of Obama at the podium might create the impression that he delivered this whole testimonial at the 2016 convention. In fact, Obama said the preceding lines in a speech in Vermont in 2006, when Obama was an Illinois senator supporting then-congressman Sanders' bid for the Senate.  3) The ""Feel the Bern"" quote came during an endorsement of Hillary Clinton  Obama did say, ""That's right. Feel the Bern!"" at the 2016 convention. But he said it while trying to get Sanders supporters to vote for Clinton, not while offering an endorsement of Sanders. Obama was trying to unite the party behind Clinton after her contentious primary with Sanders. During Obama's lengthy testimonial to Clinton, he complimented Sanders supporters -- and promptly encouraged everybody to vote for Democrats. ""So if you agree that there's too much inequality in our economy and too much money in our politics, we all need to be as vocal and as organized and as persistent as Bernie Sanders supporters have been during this election,"" Obama said. There were cheers. Obama continued: ""We all need to get out and vote for Democrats up and down the ticket, and then hold them accountable until they get the job done."" The crowd cheered again, and there was a chant of ""Ber-nie!""  Obama then said, ""That's right -- feel the Bern!"" Obama's office declined to comment. Sanders' campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

120,CNN,"Ellis was also involved in the Ukraine controversy that triggered the impeachment inquiry into Trump.  Acting on orders from top NSC lawyer John Eisenberg -- Ellis told officials in the NSC's executive secretariat to move the transcript of Trump's now infamous July 25 call with the Ukrainian president to a more highly classified server, according to testimony from Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman. CNN previously reported that the order to move the transcript was given to prevent more people from seeing it, according to people familiar with the situation. It also came after recognition the document would need to be preserved for legal reasons. While Trump has sought to punish officials, like Vindman, over their cooperation in the House impeachment inquiry, the promotion of Ellis suggests the President is inclined to reward those he believes attempted to mitigate the potential fallout.    Like Grenell, Ellis is seen as a Trump loyalist who joined the administration early on, two sources familiar with the situation told CNN. In addition to working in the White House counsel's office, Ellis has served as deputy NSC legal adviser since 2017.  Before that, Ellis worked as a staffer for the House Intelligence Committee when it was led by then-chairman, Republican Rep. Devin Nunes. He is also an intelligence officer in the Navy reserve. Ellis, a political appointee, will replace a career official who is heading back to their home agency, an administration official told CNN. The move plays into a broader downsizing at the NSC that has been initiated by Trump's national security adviser Robert O'Brien.  It will contribute to the increased percentage of political appointees at the NSC -- which O'Brien said would occur. A new deputy NSC legal adviser will be named to take over for Ellis as he moves into his new role, and that individual will also be a political appointee, a source familiar with the moves tells CNN."

124,CNN,"2. ""A lot of people thought we shouldn't have done it that early, and we did, and it turned out to be a very good thing."" Again: Trump wants you to know he was right. Others were wrong. This is very important. 3. ""Because of all we've done, the risk to the American people remains very low."" Quantifying what ""very low"" means from a risk perspective is tough. But it is worth noting that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said earlier this week that the spread of coronavirus in the US is inevitable. 4. ""We are ready to adapt and we are ready to do whatever we have to as the disease spreads, if it spreads."" ""We expect we will see community spread in this country. It's not so much a question of if this will happen anymore, but rather more a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness."" -- Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.  5. ""We started out by looking at certain things and we've been working with the Hill very, very carefully, very strongly."" ""Looking at certain things,"" you say? Verrrry intriguing. (Nota bene: Trump is almost certainly working from a prepared statement here.) 6. ""And I think we have very good bipartisan spirit for money."" ""Bipartisan Spirit for Money"" is going to be the title of my memoir. 7. ""And again, we've had tremendous success -- tremendous success beyond what people would have thought."" The presumption here is that people had thoughts about how the US would deal with coronavirus. And that we have far exceeded those expectations. Which is weird. 8. ""One instance where we think we can be -- it's somewhat reliable, it seems to have gotten quite a bit smaller."" In which the President of the United States suggests the outbreak in China is slowing -- citing a ""somewhat reliable"" source. Good times! 9. ""The vaccine is coming along well. And in speaking to the doctors, we think this is something that we can develop fairly rapidly, a vaccine for the future and coordinate with the support of our partners."" ""At the earliest an efficacy trial would take an additional six to eight months. So although this is the fastest we have ever gone from a sequence of a virus to a trial, it still would not be any applicable to the epidemic unless we really wait about a year to a year and a half."" -- Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at NIH, shortly after Trump made his claim. 10. ""But we're very, very ready for this, for anything whether it's going to be a breakout of larger proportions or whether or not we're -- you know we're at that very low level."" [nods head very slowly] 11. ""The -- John's Hopkins I guess is a highly respected great place. They did a -- a -- a study, comprehensive. The countries best and worst prepared for an epidemic. And the United States is now -- we're rated number one."" Boom! We're No. 1! We're No. 1! 12. ""He's very good and I think -- and he's really very expert at the field."" What infectious disease specialist is the President referring to here? Vice President Mike Pence! Who is not an ""expert"" in the field! 13. ""Well, I don't think it's inevitable. It probably will. It possibly will. It could be at a very small level or it could be at a larger level."" The CDC says the spread of coronavirus in the United States is inevitable. Donald Trump says it isn't. Which do you believe? 14. ""I'm the President of the United States. I'm not a President of other countries."" Fact check: True! 15. ""I'll be going to meetings quite a bit depending on what they want to do and what message we want to get out."" Uh huh. 16. ""But we've done really an extraordinary job, when you look at a country this size with so many people pouring in, we're the number one in the world for the people coming into a country by far."" Again, Trump wants the big takeaway here to be that he is doing an amazing job -- whether or not coronavirus spreads widely in the US. 17. ""I think they look at the people that you watched debating last night, and they say, if there's even a possibility that can happen, I think it really takes a hit because of that."" In which the President says that the reason the stock market is tumbling isn't just fears of the coronavirus' impact on the economy (it is) but rather because people didn't like what they saw in the Democratic debate on Tuesday night. Cool story bro! 18. ""So you know, my attitude, if Congress wants to give us the money so easy -- it wasn't very easy for the wall, but we got that one done."" So, just to be clear, Trump declared a national emergency at the border in order to seize money already allocated for other uses so that he could begin construction of the southern border wall. 19. ""And again, when you have 15 and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that's a pretty good job we've done."" One wonders whether Trump has injured himself with such aggressive back-patting. 20. ""I'm leading everybody, we're doing great."" Yeah, this all checks out. Doing great! 21. ""She's trying to create a panic and there's no reason to panic because we have done so good."" Just the President accusing Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi of trying to create a panic. Also worth noting: Trump thinks his administration has ""done so good"" on dealing with the coronavirus. 22. ""When I mentioned the flu, I said -- actually, I asked the various doctors, I said, is this just like flu? Because people die from the flu. And this is very unusual."" OK, so Trump has now learned that coronavirus is not the flu. So, that's something? 23. ""But we have it so well under control. I mean, we really have done a very good job."" Yes, I think you may have mentioned that. 24. ""I think the financial markets are very upset when they look at the Democrat candidates standing on that stage making fools out of themselves."" Trump, again tries to tie the stock market drop to the Democratic debate. There is, of course, zero evidence to back up this claim. 25. ""It's a little like the regular flu that we have flu shots for. And we'll essentially have a flu shot for this in a fairly quick manner."" [narrator voice] We won't. 26. ""When somebody sneezes -- I mean, I try and bail out as much as possible when there's sneezing."" Honestly, same. 27. ""Ebola, you disintegrated, especially at the beginning."" This is, um, not a medical definition of the effects of Ebola -- just in case you were wondering. 28. ""This is a flu. This is like a flu and this is a much different situation than Ebola."" But you just said this isn't the flu? Right? 29. ""It'd be very easy for me to say, you know -- it doesn't matter what I say really."" So, well, yeah. 30. ""There's a chance that it won't spread, too, and there's a chance that it will."" So you're saying there's a chance ... 31. ""So far we've done a great job."" This feels like a good place to end."

126,CNN,"CNN submitted a detailed list of questions about the leaked records to the Chinese government prior to publication but has not yet received a response. The document was leaked to CNN, along with a number of international media organizations, and published on February 17. It was verified by a team of researchers, led by Adrian Zenz, a senior fellow in China studies at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation. The experts confirmed the identities of 337 out of more than 2,800 individuals mentioned in the document and noted similarities between the leaked document and other Chinese government records from Xinjiang. CNN independently corroborated the details of eight families mentioned in the documents. Threats to the state Xinjiang in China's far west has been for centuries the home to a large population of Muslim-majority ethnic groups, the largest of which is the Uyghur people. Since 2016 there have been reports of Uyghurs and other groups like them being put into mass detention centers by the Chinese government, referred to by Beijing as ""vocational education and training centers."" Inside, according to former detainees, they are taught Communist Party propaganda and Mandarin language skills. Some detainees have also spoken of prison-like conditions and alleged that they had been tortured, which China has denied. The US State Department estimates that up to two million people may have been taken to the camps. The Chinese government has regularly stated the centers are voluntary and are no longer in heavy use in Xinjiang. The leaked document laid out detailed records on the Karakax citizens' family members, religious activities and evaluations of their behavior while in detention. It revealed for the first time the everyday criteria for which Uyghurs and other Muslim groups could be detained indefinitely in Beijing's re-education camps. Those included having an unused passport, growing a long beard or being perceived as a ""potential threat."" For some citizens, being a ""potential threat"" could mean anything from a history of radicalization to being born in the 1980s or after. Speaking to CNN, academic Zenz said that the strength of China's rebuttal had only reinforced for him the authenticity of the document, saying he had been surprised by the number of state-run media articles pushing back against the leak. In an earlier interview, he said the records showed people in many cases were being detained for acts which didn't ""remotely resemble a crime."" ""The contents of this document are really significant to all of us because it shows us the paranoid mindset of a regime that's controlling the up-and-coming super power of this globe,"" Zenz told CNN. 'Wishful conjecture' At the press conference on Saturday, one of the top officials for Karakax county, Mehmutjan Umarjan said that the reporting of the document was ""full of subjective assumptions"" and ""wishful conjecture."" ""Thus cannot stand scrutiny, as it does not conform with the facts,"" he said. Speaking from behind a face mask at the press conference, a Uyghur man told reporters that he had been to a ""training center"" but insisted it had been ""for his own good."" ""My mind used to be filled with religious extremist thinking. Not only did I not earn a living for my family, but I also prohibited my wife from doing so, because I believed it was against Muslim practices for women to earn money,"" he said in videos released by state broadcaster CCTV. ""At the center, I learned to speak Mandarin and about national laws and regulations. I also got lessons in business management."" The ruling Communist Party has in the past put relatives of Uyghur dissidents or citizens mentioned in leaks on state television to rebut negative stories in international media. It is a common tactic when working to challenge allegations about human rights abuses in Xinjiang. CNN can't independently verify the accounts of these people or whether they were speaking under duress due to the heavy censorship in Xinjiang.   China Daily, a Chinese state owned media outlet, published a video of a male Karakax resident who had studied at a ""training center"" after being ""influenced by religious extremism and committed minor offenses."" In the leaked document, the man is recorded as having being put into a detention center in 2017 for having one more child than allowed. Speaking on camera in Mandarin, the resident said he had not been sent to detention for having a relative overseas. ""That is a total lie ... Me and my family are having a happy life together,"" he said in a statement to camera. Academic Zenz said that publishing videos of Chinese citizens yelling into the camera was an escalation in Communist Party propaganda. ""(The state media interviewees) are saying 'You're destroying our good life.' Why would a media report ruin their life?"" he said. ""It ruins the reputation of the CCP and the CCP is making them respond to a harm that's only been inflicted on the CCP."""
127,CNN,"After days of attacks from the President following Stone's sentencing last week, the hearing finally clarified Stone's reasons for wanting a new trial: He believes his jury forewoman wasn't truthful with the court when she said she didn't remember social media posts she had made about Trump and that she could consider Stone's evidence fairly. Stone also took issue with his jury's deliberations, suggesting they may have been tainted. The defense lawyers pointed especially at posts the jury forewoman, Tomeka Hart, had written on social media before the trial that were critical of Trump and commented on arrests in the Mueller investigation. Jackson didn't make a decision on Stone's new-trial request on Tuesday and batted down, using jurors' testimony, Stone's suggestion that the jury's deliberations had considered outside opinions and information. The more than four-hour court proceeding took an unexpected turn when Jackson announced she had gathered nearly all of Stone's jurors at the courthouse, that they were sitting in an adjacent room waiting and that she would allow prosecutors and the defense team to question a few of them, shielding their identities in the court transcripts and to those outside the courtroom. Jackson said she had brought in the jurors ""out of an abundance of caution."" Acknowledging Stone might appeal her decision, Jackson noted they would question the foreperson to create a full record of what had happened at Stone's jury selection. ""So we're going to go forward and ask this foreperson questions in a professional and nonconfrontational way,"" she added. ""We're going to give this a try."" Hart then testified to a closed courtroom. The public was able to listen to her testimony -- without seeing her -- live. Stone's legal team questioned Hart extensively about her posts on social media, and she maintained she had answered the court truthfully both in writing and in person when she said she didn't recall posting about Stone or what she had heard about him. She did, however, post two hearts and a fist bump in emoji the morning of the verdict, linking to a now-unavailable Facebook post that she doesn't remember. And she posted on social media about Trump's impeachment during Stone's trial. The judge asked Hart on the stand, ""Were you making any effort to downplay"" posts the forewoman had made before jury selection when asked about them before the trial. ""No, absolutely not,"" Hart said. Stone's legal defense team tried to tie Hart's public opinions about Trump, his supporters and his policies toward race in America to Stone. Hart said she didn't know what role Stone had played in the campaign before his trial, but ""I knew he was arrested because of connections"" to the Russia probe. An opinion about the President and his polices, however, wouldn't necessarily mean Hart had an opinion about Stone or that she couldn't judge his case fairly, Jackson said. Two other jurors who testified about their secret deliberations over Stone noted that Hart did not push them toward an opinion or share outside information with the jury, and that the jury had carefully walked through every charge Stone faced to determine his guilt on seven counts. One juror noted, under oath, ""Most of us agreed on our answer. We already said he was guilty, but it was the foreman (Hart) that insisted we examine (one of Stone's charges) a little more."" The hearing also prompted Jackson to question prosecutor Michael Marando, who withdrew from the case after Justice Department leadership challenged his and three others' work on it, and Stone's defense attorney Robert Buschel in the courtroom about their teams' handling of the jury selection process. Marando described how the prosecutors had picked up the list of juror names from the courthouse and transmitted it to Stone's defense team before the trial. ""It's coming back to me now. A lot has happened,"" he said. And Buschel described how Stone's team had hired a jury consultant, yet didn't research the list of names of possible jurors before the trial's start. Underscoring the political drama, Trump tweeted twice about the Stone case during the hearing.  ""There has rarely been a juror so tainted as the forewoman in the Roger Stone case. Look at her background. She never revealed her hatred of 'Trump' and Stone. She was totally biased, as is the judge. Roger wasn't even working on my campaign. Miscarriage of justice. Sad to watch!"" the President tweeted roughly 90 minutes after the hearing began. (Stone was part of Trump's campaign in 2015, however.) Questions over the jury forewoman have allowed Stone and Trump to publicly try to muddy his conviction. Stone has also unsuccessfully tried to remove Jackson from handling his case, while Trump has commented on the case several times in recent days, regarding both the judge and the forewoman. It's unknown what each of Stone's 120 potential jurors told the court in written questionnaires they filled out before the November trial, well before the prosecutors and defense narrowed the jury to 12 plus alternates. The questionnaires asked each their opinions of Trump and Stone, among several other questions.  At the start of Stone's November trial, both prosecutors and Stone's defense team were then able to question potential jurors and challenge them from sitting on the jury. They questioned Hart about her background and her ability to judge Stone impartially, according to a transcript of the trial's first day. Before the judge, she told them she could evaluate the evidence in the case fairly. Stone's team didn't challenge her from being seated on the jury. Trump has attacked the jury forewoman multiple times publicly, calling the juror's unanimous findings of Stone's guilt on all seven charges he faced ""tainted.""  ""You have a juror that is obviously tainted. She was an activist against Trump. She said bad things about Trump and bad things about Stone,"" the President claimed over the weekend. ""She somehow weaseled her way onto the jury and if that's not a tainted jury then there is no such thing as a tainted jury."" He and Stone's team have latched onto the social media posts she made before the trial criticizing Trump and his supporters. Hart publicly identified herself as Stone's jury forewoman two weeks ago, after the four prosecutors who took him to trial quit his case. The DC District Court has not named her as a juror or as the forewoman. Once before, Stone asked for a retrial unsuccessfully. He had claimed a juror shouldn't have been selected who worked for the IRS and had read news about his case before the trial, but Jackson found this request didn't merit a new trial. In a decision this weekend to deny Stone's attempt to remove her from the case, Jackson noted Stone's recent requests of the court may be more publicity stunts than legal pleadings. He had claimed she couldn't evaluate his retrial request fairly because she said jurors had integrity during his sentencing. ""At bottom, given the absence of any factual or legal support for the motion for disqualification, the pleading [asking for the Jackson's recusal] appears to be nothing more than an attempt to use the Court's docket to disseminate a statement for public consumption that has the words 'judge' and 'biased' in it,"" she wrote. Jackson sentenced Stone to 40 months in prison last week, for obstructing Congress as a way to protect the President and his campaign's interests in 2016. This story has been updated with additional details from the hearing."

129,CNN,"My baby girl. Gianna Bryant is an amazingly sweet and gentle soul. She was very thoughtful and always kissed me good night and kissed me good morning. There were a few occasions where I was absolutely tired from being up with Bianka and Capri, and i thought she had left to school without saying goodbye. I text and say, ""No kiss?"" And Gianna would reply with, ""Mama, I kissed you. You were asleep and I didn't want to wake you."" She knew how much her morning and evening kisses meant to me, and she was so thoughtful to remember to kiss me every day. She was daddy's girl, but I know she loved her mama, and she would always show me and tell me that she loved me. She was one of my very best friends.  She loved to bake. She loved putting a smile on everyone's face. Last August she made a beautiful birthday cake for her daddy, and it had fondant and looked like it had blue agate crystals. Kobe's birthday cake looked like it was professionally decorated. She made the best chocolate chip cookies. She loved watching cooking shows and ""Cupcake Wars"" with me, and she loved watching ""Survivor"" and ""NBA on TNT"" with her daddy. She also loved watching Disney movies with her sisters.  Gigi was very competitive like her daddy, but she had a sweet grace about her. Her smile was like sunshine. Her smile took up her entire face, like mine. Kobe always said she was me. She had my fire, my personality and sarcasm, and she was tender and loving on the inside. She had the best laugh. It was infectious. It was pure and genuine.  Kobe and Gianna naturally gravitated towards each other. She had Kobe's ability to listen to a song and have all the lyrics memorized after listening to the song a couple of times; it was their secret talent.  She was an incredible athlete. She was great at gymnastics, soccer, softball, dance, and basketball. She was an incredible dancer, too. She loved to swim, dance, do cartwheels and do jumps into our swimming pool. Gigi loved her TikTok dances.  Gigi was confident but not in an arrogant way. She loved helping and teaching other people things. At school she offered the boy's basketball coaches to help give the boys' basketball team some pointers, like the triangle offense. She was very much like her daddy and they both liked helping people learn new things and master them. They were great teachers.  Gigi was very sweet. She always made sure everybody was okay and she was our shepherd. She always kept our family together. She loved family traditions, and family movie night was important to her. She always looked out for everyone. She was very much in tune with our feelings and wanted the best for us.  Gianna was smart, She knew how to read, speak and write Mandarin, she knew Spanish and had great grades and kept them up all while becoming a great basketball player. She was president of school spirit, on student council. She was director's assistant for her school play just like her big sister. She was looking forward to graduating eighth grade and moving on to high school with her big sister, Natalia. I am so happy she was given the opportunity to know that she was accepted to the same high school. She was really happy.  Gianna made us all proud and she still does. Gianna never tried to conform. She was always herself. She was a nice person, a leader, a teacher, wearing a white tee, black leggings, a denim jacket, white high top Converse and a flannel tied around her waist, and straight hair was her go-to style. She had rhythm and swag since she was a baby. She gave the best hugs and the best kisses. She had gorgeous, soft lips like her daddy. She would hug me and hold me so tight, I could feel her love me, and I loved the way she looked up at me, it was as if she was soaking me all in. We love each other so much. I miss her so much.  She was so energetic. I couldn't keep up with her energy. She lapped Natalia and I on track once. She was about six years old. We let her have a head start and she still dusted us. I miss her sweet kisses and cleverness, and I miss her sarcasm and her wit, and that adorable sly side smile followed with a grin and a burst of laughter. We shared the same ""cat that ate the canary"" grin. Gigi was sunshine. She brightened up my day every day. I miss looking at her beautiful face. She was always so good. A rule follower. I knew I could always count on her to do the right thing. She was the most loving daughter, thoughtful little sister and silly big sister. She often helped to carry the littles' baby bag and playing with them, and she loved helping with Bianka and Capri. Bianka loved going to the playground, swimming and jumping on the trampoline with Gigi. I used to tell Gigi I thought KoKo considered her her favorite sister. Capri would smile from ear to ear when Gigi walked into the room, and Capri reminds me a lot of Gianna. They look alike and just smile with their whole face -- pure joy.  We will not be able to see Gigi go to high school with Natalia and ask her how her day went. We didn't get a chance to teach her how to drive a car. I won't be able to tell her how gorgeous she looks on her wedding day. I will never get to see my baby girl walk down the aisle, have a father-daughter dance with her daddy, dance on the dance floor with me and have babies of her own. Gianna would have been an amazing mommy. She was very maternal ever since she was really little.  Gigi would've most likely become the best player in the WNBA. She would've made a huge difference for women's basketball. Gigi was motivated to change the way everyone viewed women in sports. She wrote papers in school defending women and wrote about how the unequal pay difference for the NBA and WNBA leagues wasn't fair. And i truly feel she made positive change for the WNBA players now, because they knew Gigi's goal was to eventually play in the WNBA.  I am still so proud of Gianna, and she was kind to everybody she met for the 13 years she was here on Earth. Her classmates shared many fond stories with us, and those stories reminded me that Gianna loved and showed everyone that no act of kindness is ever too small to make a difference in someone's life. She was always, always, always considerate of others and their feelings. She was a beautiful, kind, happy, silly, thoughtful and loving sister and daughter. She was so full of life and had so much more to offer this world. I cannot imagine life without her. Mommy, Natalia, Bianka, Capri and Daddy love you so much, Gigi. I will miss your sweet handmade cards, your sweet kisses, and your gorgeous smile. I miss you, all of you, every day. I love you.  Kobe Bryant Now for my soulmate. Kobe was known as a fierce competitor on the basketball court. The greatest of all time, a writer, an Oscar winner and the Black Mamba. But to me he was KobKob, my Boo-Boo, my Bae-Boo, my papi chulo. I was his VeBe, his principessa, his reina, Queen Mama -- Mamba -- and his [inaudible nickname].  I couldn't see him as a celebrity nor just an incredible basketball player. He was my sweet husband and the beautiful father of my children. He was mine. He was my everything.  Kobe and I have been together since I was 17-and-a-half years old. I was his first girlfriend, his first love, his wife, his best friend, his confidant and his protector. He was the most amazing husband. Kobe loved me more than I could ever express or put into words. He was the early bird and I was the night owl, I was fire and he was ice, and vice versa at times. We balanced each other out. He would do anything for me. I have no idea how I deserved a man that loved and wanted me more than Kobe. He was charismatic, a gentleman, he was loving and adoring and romantic. He was truly the romantic one in our relationship. I looked forward to Valentine's Day and our anniversaries every year. He planned special anniversary trips and a special traditional gift for every year of our marriage. He even handmade my most treasured gifts. He just thought outside the box and was so thoughtful even while working hard to be the best athlete. He gave to me the actual notebook and the blue dress Rachel McAdams wore in ""The Notebook"" movie. When I asked him why he chose the blue dress, he said because it was the scene when Allie comes back to Noah. We had hoped to grow old together like the movie. We really had an amazing love story. We loved each other with our whole beings, two perfectly imperfect people raising a beautiful family and our sweet and amazing girls.  A couple weeks before they passed Kobe sent me a sweet text and mentioned how he wanted to spend time together, just the two of us, without our kids, because I am his best friend first. We never got the chance to do it. We were busy taking care of our girls and just doing our regular everyday responsibilities. But I'm thankful I have that recent text. It means so much to me. Kobe wanted us to renew our vows. He wanted Natalia to take over his company and he wanted to travel the world together. We talked about how we would be the fun grandparents to our daughters' children. He would have been the coolest grandpa.  Kobe was the MVP of girl dads, or MVD. He never left the toilet seat up. He always told the girls how beautiful and smart they are. He taught them how to be brave and how to keep pushing forward when things get tough. When Kobe retired from the NBA, he took over dropping off and picking up our girls from school since I was at home pregnant with Bianka and just recently home nursing Capri.  When Kobe was still playing, I used to show up an hour early to be the first in line to pick up Natalia and Gianna from school, and I told him he couldn't drop the ball once he took over. He was late one time, and we most definitely let him know that I was never late. So he showed up one hour and 20 minutes early after that.  He always knew there was room for improvement and wanted to do better. He happily did carpool and enjoyed spending time in the car with our girls. He was a doting father, a father that was hands on and present. He helped me bathe Bianka and Capri almost every night. He would sing them silly songs in the shower and continue making them laugh and smile as he lathered them in lotion and got them ready for bed. He had magic arms and could put Capri to sleep in only a few minutes. He said he had it down to a science, eight times up and down our hallway. He loved taking Bianka to Fashion Island and watching her play in the koi pond area and loved taking her to the park. Their most recent visit to the koi pond was the evening before he and Gigi passed. He shared a love of movies and breakdown of films with Natalia. He enjoyed renting out theaters and taking Natalia to watch the newest ""Star Wars"" movie or ""Harry Potter"" films. They would have movie marathons and he enjoyed every second of it. He loved the typical tearjerkers, too, and he loved watching ""Stepmom,"" Steel Magnolias,"" and ""Little Women."" He had a tender heart.  Kobe somehow knew where I was at all times, specifically when I was late to his games. He would worry about me if I wasn't in my seat at the start of each game and would ask security where I was, at the first time out of the first quarter. My smart ass would tell him he was not going to drop 81 points within the first 10 minutes of the game. I think anybody with kids understands that sometimes you can't make it out the door on time, and eventually he was used to my tardiness and balled out. The fact that he could play on an intense professional level and still be concerned by making sure we made it to the game safely is just another example of how family came first to him.  He loved being Gianna's basketball coach. He told me he wished he would have convinced Natalia to play basketball so they could have spent more time together, and he also wanted her to pursue her own passion. He watched Natalia play in a volleyball tournament on her birthday, January 19, and he noticed how she's a very intelligent player. He was convinced she would have made a great point guard with her vision of the court. And he told me he wanted Bianka and Capri to take up basketball so he could spend just as much time with him as he did with Gigi. Kobe always told Bianka and Capri that they were going to grow up, play basketball and 'mix they ass up.' Now they won't have their daddy and sister here to teach them, and that is truly a loss I do not understand. I am so thankful Kobe heard KoKo say, ""Dada."" He is not here to drop Bianka and Capri off at pre-K or kindergarten, and he will not be here to tell me to get a grip when we have to leave the kindergarten classroom, and he is not going to be able to walk our girls down the aisle or spin me around on the dance floor, singing PYT to me. But I want my daughters to know and remember the amazing person, husband and father he was. The kind of man that wanted to teach future generations to be better and keep them from making his own mistakes. He always liked working and doing projects to improve kids' lives. He taught us all valuable lessons about life and sports through his NBA career, his books, his show, ""Detail,"" and his ""Punies"" podcast series. We are so thankful he left those lessons and stories behind for us.  He was thoughtful and always wrote the best love letters and cards, and Gigi had his wonderful ability to express her feelings into paper and make you feel her love through his words. She was thoughtful like him. They were so easy to love. Everybody naturally gravitated towards them. They were funny, happy, silly, and they loved life. They were so full of joy and adventure. God knew they couldn't be on this Earth without each other. He had to bring them home to have them together. Babe, you take care of our Gigi. I got Nati, BiBi and KoKo, and we're still the best team.  We love and miss you, Boo-Boo and Gigi. May you both rest in peace and have fun in heaven until we meet again one day. We love you both and miss you forever and always, Mommy. Correction: This story has been updated with the correct spelling of KoKo Bryant's nickname."

""There is no rule and no case law that would justify the recusal of a judge for bias simply because he or she says something about an issue on the docket, on the record, at some point before a reply has been filed, or before a hearing -- which may or may not be required in the Court's discretion -- has concluded. If parties could move to disqualify every judge who furrows his brow at one side or the other before ruling, the entire court system would come to a standstill,"" according to Jackson.

""It granted,"" she wrote, writing about her court using the third-person pronoun, ""important evidentiary motions in his favor; it proposed utilizing a written questionnaire to ensure that the parties could receive more information than is usually available for jury selection; it struck 58 potential jurors for cause based on the defendant's motions or on its own motion; and it repeatedly resolved bond issues in his favor, even after he took to social media to intimidate the Court, after he violated conditions imposed by the Court, after he was convicted at trial, and after he was sentenced to a term of incarceration.

133,CNN,"Stone legally has the ability to raise challenges about his trial after his sentencing, and his team has made clear they may seek appeals while his friends have lobbied for a presidential pardon. Stone was convicted last fall of lying to Congress and threatening a witness regarding his efforts for Trump's 2016 campaign to reach WikiLeaks about politically damaging information the group received from the Russians about Hillary Clinton. The President attacked the forewoman multiple times this past week, alleging that she was biased and led to a tainted jury.  Tomeka Hart has been identified as the juror in question. The court has not released Hart's name, or an initial juror screening questionnaire she filled out, but her bio matches the questioning of juror 1261, who acknowledged to the court during the trial's first day in November that she ran for Congress and lived in Tennessee.  Hart publicly revealed herself to be the Stone jury forewoman last week in a post on social media. Stone's defense team did not attempt to challenge juror 1261 from serving on the jury at the time. Hart told the judge and lawyers for both sides that she could be impartial. But it's still not known what Hart told the court, when asked in a written questionnaire her opinion of Trump, who was mentioned at trial. Stone, in his ask for a new trial, alleges a juror misled the court ""regarding her ability to be unbiased and fair and the juror attempted to cover up evidence that would directly contradict her false claims of impartiality,"" according to a filing he made Friday night. After Hart publicly identified herself as a juror forewoman, Stone's supporters attacked her for negative social media posts she made about Trump and his backers before the trial.   Hart was one of the 12 jurors chosen after neither side objected to her. According to a court transcript of the jury selection process, Hart acknowledged having a social media presence and knowing that Stone was involved in the Trump campaign and possibly connected with the Russia investigation. The presiding judge in the case, Amy Berman Jackson, asked directly: ""Is there anything about that that affects your ability to judge him fairly and impartially sitting here right now in this courtroom?"" Hart replied: ""Absolutely not."" The judge followed up: ""Can you kind of wipe the slate clean and learn what you need to learn in this case from the evidence presented in the courtroom and no other source?"" Hart replied: ""Yes."""
134,CNN,"Some of the charges are structured as either/or counts, so Weinstein can only be convicted of two charges at most -- one based on Mann's allegations and one based on Haley's. Sciorra's testimony that he raped her in the winter of 1993-1994 is outside of the statute of limitations and does not stand as a charge on its own. Still, it can be used to elevate the first-degree sex charges into predatory sexual assault charges, a count that  requires serious sex crimes against at least two victims. The jury has sent in 10 notes since deliberations began Tuesday, and several of the notes have related to Sciorra's allegations. In one note, jurors asked the court to read aloud a transcript of parts of her testimony, and in another note, they asked to rehear testimony from actress Rosie Perez, who said that Sciorra had told her about the incident. A source in Weinstein's team told CNN that he is ""cautiously optimistic"" but ""nervous."" Another source close to the Time's Up advocacy group that supports survivors of the #MeToo movement in Hollywood told CNN they are ""nervous."" What a deadlock could mean In general, a deadlocked jury results in a mistrial, such as in Bill Cosby's first sexual assault trial. The court may also choose to allow a partial verdict in which some counts are declared as a mistrial but verdicts on other counts are accepted. In Weinstein's trial on Friday, defense attorneys noted on the record that they were willing to accept a partial verdict. The government was not. In addition to Haley, Mann and Sciorra, three other women testified during the trial that Weinstein sexually attacked them as prosecutors sought to show that he used his power in the movie industry to prey on young, inexperienced women. However, Weinstein's defense attorneys argued that the sexual encounters were consensual. As evidence, they pointed out that both Haley and Mann had sex with Weinstein after the alleged attacks, and they continued to have friendly contact with him for years afterward. He has also denied allegations of non-consensual sexual activity related to the other women. The women's testimonies highlighted thorny questions around consent and power dynamics at the heart of the #MeToo movement -- questions that have rarely, if ever, been tested in a courtroom. Once an acclaimed producer of movies such as ""Shakespeare in Love"" and ""Pulp Fiction,"" Weinstein was accused by multiple women of a wide range of sexual misconduct in stories published in October 2017 in The New York Times and The New Yorker. A wave of similar claims against other influential men for allegedly abusing their power ensued in what is now known as the #MeToo movement. Weinstein also faces charges of sexual assault and rape in separate incidents in Los Angeles."
135,CNN,"Whitaker was asked about Trump's pressure campaign on Ukraine to obtain dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden, an effort that led to the President's impeachment in the House and acquittal in the Senate. The former acting attorney general brushed off the notion that the Ukraine scandal will somehow lead to unchecked presidential powers. ""We got a transcript and we read the transcript and everybody can see what the transcript says and what the President did,"" he said. ""I agree with Republicans that it's not an impeachable offense. I don't think it provides a safe harbor that now the President can ask for personal favors."" Whitaker said Democrats failed to remove the President, in part, because they lacked the votes to do so in the Senate. ""Elections fundamentally have consequences,"" Whitaker said. Whitaker also weighed in on current Attorney General William Barr's recent complaints that Trump's tweets about sensitive Justice Department cases make his life more difficult.  ""I believe Bill Barr when he says the President tweeting about cases is not helpful for him running the Department of Justice and administering justice,"" Whitaker said.   ""I was lucky that I didn't have the President tweeting about cases, except for the Mueller investigation while I was acting attorney general,"" Whitaker added. ""So that was good for my experience."""
136,CNN,"Here's a look at what jurors have asked so far. Legal definitions of the charges About 40 minutes after they started deliberations Tuesday, the jury sent a lengthy note asking for clarifications on a number of legal issues. The note asked for legal definitions of many of the terms in the charges and why the statute of limitations has not run out for certain crimes. The questions indicated they didn't understand how the verdict form was structured. It was an understandable question; the verdict form in Weinstein's trial included a complex mix of either/or charges, witnesses who are not directly part of charges and legal terms with specific definitions. In essence, Weinstein is primarily charged with alleged sexual attacks against Haley and Mann. If the jury finds him guilty on either or both of the first-degree felony counts -- criminal sexual act and/or rape --  then Sciorra's rape allegation can escalate the charges to the more serious felony of predatory sexual assault, which is punishable by up to life in prison. We explain the answer in more detail here. Blueprint of Weinstein's apartment and Black Cube emails On Tuesday afternoon, the jury sent in a note asking for a copy of the blueprint of Weinstein's apartment in SoHo, a neighborhood in New York. Haley, one of the two central accusers in the case, said she was sexually assaulted in the apartment in 2006. Tarale Wulff, one of the case's ""prior bad acts"" witnesses, said Weinstein pinned her down and forced her into a sex act there in 2005. Jurors also asked for a copy of all of the emails in which certain women's names are highlighted in red, referring to a list that was sent to Black Cube, an Israeli spy group that Weinstein hired to investigate allegations against him. Actress Annabella Sciorra's name was highlighted in red in the document, prosecutors said in the trial. Sciorra testified that Weinstein barged into her apartment and raped her in the winter of 1993-1994. Miriam Haley's charges and related emails On Wednesday morning, the jury asked for a transcript of Haley's direct testimony and cross-examination concerning events on July 10, 2006 -- the date of the alleged assault -- and on July 26, 2006, when she met Weinstein at a hotel and had sex with him. She testified that she did not physically fight Weinstein in the second incident. Judge James Burke said he cannot give them the transcript but it can be re-read if they would like. The jury also asked the judge to re-read the two charges concerning Haley: predatory sexual assault and first-degree criminal sexual act. Further, the jury asked to see all of the emails from Weinstein's email address ""relating to Miriam Haley."" Judge Burke said the emails will be provided to them electronically. Read Haley's testimony and more emails Just after 10 a.m. on Wednesday, the jury asked for the court to read out the transcripts of Haley's testimony about July 10, 2006, and July 26, 2006. Two court reporters read the transcript, skipping objections and material that was not allowed. It took about one hour and 5 minutes. Jurors also asked a slightly different email question: ""Please provide all emails between the defendant and Miriam Haley and any emails from the defendant to others regarding Miriam Haley.""  After some legal debate between the defense and prosecution, the judge ruled that the jury can have access to all emails between Weinstein's email addresses and Haley, any emails from Weinstein to others regarding Haley and any emails from Weinstein Company email addresses regarding Haley. During the trial, defense attorneys highlighted texts and emails Haley sent to Weinstein in 2006 and 2007, after the alleged attack, that they say makes clear that she wanted to continue seeing him afterward. The prosecution had objected to including the Weinstein Company emails, but they were overruled. The emails were loaded onto a clean computer and taken to the jury room. Read Rosie Perez's testimony about Sciorra On Wednesday afternoon, jurors asked that Rosie Perez's testimony be read to them.  Perez, the actress known for ""Do the Right Thing,"" testified that Sciorra told her about the alleged rape in a phone call shortly after it happened, but Sciorra wouldn't say who did it. ""I think I was raped,"" Sciorra said, according to Perez's testimony. It wasn't until months later, when Perez called Sciorra in London after hearing that Weinstein was allegedly stalking her, that she learned who the attacker was, she testified. ""She told me that it was in fact Harvey Weinstein that raped her,"" Perez said. Court reporters read Perez's testimony to the jury, which took up the rest of Wednesday's deliberations. Jurors also asked three other questions for materials presented at trial. They asked for a copy of all communication between Weinstein and Paul Feldsher, Weinstein's friend who testified that the movie producer was a ""sex addict."" They asked for a copy of the PowerPoint presentation of Dr. Barbara Ziv, the forensic psychiatrist who testified for the prosecution about ""rape myths."" Judge Burke said the presentation could not be provided because it was considered demonstrative evidence. Finally, jurors asked for all written or digital communications mentioning Sciorra that were presented as evidence, including communications involving Black Cube or Guidepost Solutions, both investigative firms. Read Sciorra's cross-examination Late Thursday afternoon, the jury asked that the court read the cross-examination and ""everything afterward"" regarding Sciorra's testimony.  A transcript was to the jurors on Friday morning. List of Sciorra's contacts Also Thursday, the jury sent a note asking for an exhibit that shows the list of people Sciorra spoke to about the alleged attack. The judge said that item was not received into evidence, so it will not be provided to the jury. No more Sciorra transcript As the court reporters read a transcript of Sciorra's testimony on Friday morning, the jury sent a note during the bathroom break saying they had heard enough of the readback didn't want to hear any more.  10-minute break outside Midday Friday, the jury requested a 10-minute break outside. If they can be hung on counts The jury has asked the judge if they can be hung on count one and/or count three while agreeing on other counts. Count 1 is predatory sexual assault related to Haley and Sciorra, and Count 3 is predatory sexual assault related to Mann and Sciorra. Judge Burke charged the jury to continue deliberations. ""As I told you in my initial instructions, any verdict you return on any count must be unanimous verdict,"" he said. ""If you cannot return a verdict on a particular count you cannot return a verdict on that count."" Burke said while sometimes juries think they could never get to a verdict, ""after further deliberation most juries are able to reach a unanimous verdict."""
137,CNN,"""Of all the circumstances in this case, that may be the most pernicious. The truth still exists. The truth still matters. Roger Stone's insistence that it doesn't, his belligerence, his pride in his own lies are a threat to our most fundamental institutions, to the very foundation of our democracy."" ""And if it goes unpunished, it will not be a victory for one party or another. Everyone loses because everyone depends on the representatives they elect to make the right decisions on a myriad of issues -- many of which are politically charged but many of which aren't -- based on the facts. ""Everyone depends on our elected representatives to protect our elections from foreign interference based on the facts. No one knows where the threat is going to come from next time or whose side they're going to be on, and for that reason the dismay and disgust at the defendant's belligerence should transcend party. ""The dismay and the disgust at the attempts by others to defend his actions as just business as usual in our polarized climate should transcend party. The dismay and the disgust with any attempts to interfere with the efforts of prosecutors and members of the judiciary to fulfill their duty should transcend party. ""Sure, the defense is free to say: So what? Who cares? But, I'll say this: Congress cared. The United States Department of Justice and the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia that prosecuted the case and is still prosecuting the case cared. The jurors who served with integrity under difficult circumstances cared. The American people cared. And I care."" On the need for an independent judiciary ""This case also exemplifies why it is that this system, for good reason, demands that the responsibility falls to someone neutral.  ""Someone whose job may involve issuing opinions in favor of and against the same administration in the same week, and not someone who has a longstanding friendship with the defendant. Not someone whose political career was aided by the defendant. And surely not someone who has personal involvement in the events underlying the case. The court cannot be influenced by those comments. They were entirely inappropriate, but I will not hold them against the defendant either.  ""It would be equally improper to be buffeted by the winds blowing from the left, the enthusiastic callers who object to what the defendant stands for. I cannot and will not sentence him for the behavior of those he supports. Sentencing is personal, and it's based on the evidence.""  On the responsibility of sentencing ""The only people who think this is easy are the ones who don't have to make the decision. Many people weighed in, formally through letters, informally by calling chambers, pontificating on cable TV, and in blogs, op-eds, and tweets."" On Stone covering up for Trump ""I have received letters urging me not to silence an important voice in the public arena, but that will not be an element of this sentence in any way. I expect he will keep talking. And as you've just heard when I went through the elements of the offense, he was not convicted and is not being sentenced for exercising his First Amendment rights, his support of the President's campaign or his policies.  ""He was not prosecuted, as some have complained, for standing up for the President. He was prosecuted for covering up for the President."" "
138,CNN,"Here's the layout of the latest controversy in the politically charged case. Stone wants a new trial, citing juror bias  Stone's attorneys are asking Judge Amy Berman Jackson to grant him a new trial. He's claimed alleged juror misconduct, though more details about his request are still under seal with the court. But while his request is percolating with the judge, Stone supporters and Trump have publicly attacked the jury foreperson, Tomeka Hart, since last week for what they say is her bias toward the President. Trump has also repeated a Fox News analyst's argument that Stone should get a new trial because she has made partisan comments.  Hart ran for the US Congress from Tennessee as a Democrat in 2012, losing her party's nomination to Rep. Steve Cohen. A search of Hart's social media posts finds multiple tweets criticizing Trump and the Republican Party.  Hart posted in August ""stop being racists,"" about Trump supporters at a rally, according to a Twitter account that uses the handle @hartformemphis and says it is Tomeka Hart. On the day of Stone's arrest last January, the account shared an NPR story about the end of charges being filed in the Mueller investigation. ""Brought to you by the lock her up peanut gallery,"" Hart's account posted on Twitter.  The court has not released Hart's name, but her bio matches the questioning of juror 1261, who acknowledged to the court during the trial's first day in November that she ran for Congress and lived in Tennessee. Hart publicly revealed herself to be the Stone jury forewoman last week in a post on social media.  Stone's defense team did not attempt to challenge juror 1261 from serving on the jury at the time. Hart told the judge and lawyers for both sides that she could be impartial.  Hart had remained silent about the case for months out of concern for her safety and ""politicizing the matter,"" but spoke out on Facebook this month after four prosecutors quit the case amid controversy over Stone's possible sentence.  ""I want to stand up for Aaron Zelinsky, Adam Jed, Michael Marando, and Jonathan Kravis -- the prosecutors on the Roger Stone trial,"" she wrote on Facebook. ""It pains me to see the DOJ now interfere with the hard work of the prosecutors. They acted with the utmost intelligence, integrity, and respect for our system of justice.""  The Justice Department opposes Stone's new trial request, and in a rare move said the decision was approved by Attorney General William Barr, independent of the White House. Stone must further explain his request to the court by Monday. He won't have to begin serving his sentence until at least two weeks after the judge decides on the new trial request.  What Hart said about potential bias     All 120 potential jurors in Stone's case had filled out detailed questionnaires before the trial started, designed to root out potential bias. Those questionnaires are still kept confidential by the court. But in them, each potential juror for Stone was asked if they had opinions about people who'd be mentioned at trial, including Trump. It's not known what Hart wrote on her questionnaire.  According to a court transcript of the jury selection process, Hart acknowledged having a social media presence and knowing that Stone was involved in the Trump campaign and possibly connected with the Russia investigation.  Jackson asked directly: ""Is there anything about that that affects your ability to judge him fairly and impartially sitting here right now in this courtroom?"" Hart replied: ""Absolutely not.""  The judge followed up: ""Can you kind of wipe the slate clean and learn what you need to learn in this case from the evidence presented in the courtroom and no other source?"" Hart replied: ""Yes.""  Stone attorney Robert Buschel asked Hart about the politics of the case, according to the transcript.   ""The fact that you run for an office, you're affiliated with a political party. Roger Stone is affiliated with the Republican Party, Donald Trump. You understand what I'm saying and getting at?"" Buschel said. ""I do,"" Hart said.""  ""How do you feel about that?"" Buschel asked. After the prosecutors took issue with his question, Jackson rephrased the question.  Jackson asked: ""Can you make that question a little bit more crisp? Is there anything about his affiliation with the Trump campaign and the Republican Party in general that gives you any reason to pause or hesitate or think that you couldn't fairly evaluate the evidence against him?""  Hart replied: ""No.""  Buschel replied, ""Thank you, ma'am.""   A Stone juror, Seth Cousins, said on CNN's ""Cuomo Prime Time"" on Wednesday that Hart was a fair juror.  ""She was probably the strongest advocate in the room for a rigorous process, for the rights of the defendant and for making sure that we took it seriously and looked at each charge,"" Cousins said. ""Without her in the room, we would have returned the same verdict and we would have returned it more quickly and without looking as deeply into the evidence. I am firmly convinced of that.""  Jackson rejected a similar retrial request Jackson has already rejected a previous request from Stone for a retrial because of a separate issue his team had with another juror.  Stone said a juror employed by the IRS who had worked with the Justice Department on criminal tax cases and read about Stone's arrest should have been dismissed. The juror had not given any opinions about the case, Jackson said, and dismissed Stone's request.  ""The fact that the juror was just one of these approximately 1,400 lawyers (at the IRS) does not begin to establish the sort of inherent bias that should have prompted the Court to strike (the person) in its discretion,"" Jackson wrote earlier this month. ""Counsel had ample opportunity here"" to raise issues of juror bias before the trial, she also wrote.  During jury selection, the judge said that simply having a political viewpoint would not be enough for a potential juror to be dismissed.  ""I don't necessarily think that everyone who says they have a negative opinion of the President is automatically excludable for cause,"" Jackson said at the time.   Ultimately, Stone's team asked for 47 potential jurors to be removed; the judge agreed on 40 of them.  Jackson even decided to toss one juror from the pool for potential bias against Republicans, after Stone's team asked her to, because that juror didn't completely answer a question from the judge. "

""Bob Durst did not kill Susan Berman and he does not know who did,"" lead defense attorney Dick DeGuerin said last month. ""That's the bottom line.""  Berman had been scheduled to speak with police hours after she was killed about the 1982 disappearance of Durst's wife. Berman's body was found one day after she was fatally shot. The sensational trial, which could last several months, will center on largely circumstantial evidence, including Durst's infamous muttering on the HBO documentary ""The Jinx"" that he had ""killed them all."" Jurors are also expected to hear statements he made during the three-hour interview with Lewin.  ""Most people, when they're talking to anybody ... are very much concerned with what other people think of them,"" Lewin told Durst in the interview. ""I notice that, with about 90% of the things you're asked, you are brutally honest. ... More honest than most people that I've seen."" The so-called 'Cadaver' note expected to be a key piece of evidence There is little physical evidence in Berman's nearly 20-year-old unsolved death. There are no eyewitnesses and no murder weapon.  One key piece of evidence is the so-called ""cadaver"" note, a cryptic letter sent to police with Berman's address and the word ""cadaver"" in caps that led detectives to her body.  In ""The Jinx,"" Durst said the letter could have been sent only by Berman's killer. Defense lawyers previously denied Durst wrote the note, and they tried to exclude from trial handwriting evidence about it.  But in a court filing late last year, lawyers for the real estate mogul reversed course and acknowledged that Durst penned the anonymous note. ""This does not change the fact that Bob Durst did not kill Susan Berman,"" DeGuerin said at the time. In the HBO documentary, filmmakers confronted Durst with another letter he once mailed Berman, with nearly identical handwriting to the ""cadaver"" note. In both, Beverly Hills was misspelled as ""BEVERLEY."" Lewin, in the interview with Durst, asked him, ""Why would you think the killer would have left a note?"" ""I'm gonna stay away from that,"" Durst replied. At another point, Lewin asked Durst why he hadn't fled long before the documentary aired, especially after filmmakers confronted him with the incriminating envelopes.  ""You saw the envelopes. How come you didn't ... leave then?"" the prosecutor asked. ""It's mind-boggling to me."" ""I guess inertia,"" Durst replied. ""l just didn't really, really, really think that (I) was gonna end up arrested.""  Immediately after the last shot of ""The Jinx"" finale, Durst went into the bathroom, apparently not realizing his microphone was still on. ""There it is. You're caught,"" he said. He rambled a series of seemingly unrelated sentences before saying, ""He was right. I was wrong."" Then, he muttered, ""What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.""  The defense has said it will show Durst's statements were heavily edited and not uttered in the order in which they appeared in the documentary. Durst has long maintained he had nothing to do with his first wife's disappearance Jurors are also expected to hear statements Berman made about allegedly helping Durst build an alibi for the death of his wife, Kathleen McCormack Durst, according to prosecutors. Durst has maintained he had nothing to do with his wife's disappearance. She was declared legally dead in 2017. Her body has not been found and no one has been charged in that case. McCormack was on her way to medical school in New York when she vanished in 1982.  Prosecutors said McCormack's death was the impetus for two other alleged killings that have shrouded Durst in suspicion -- Berman's killing and the 2001 slaying and dismemberment of a neighbor in the coastal Texas city of Galveston.   Superior Court Judge Mark E. Windham ruled last month that jurors can hear about Durst wanting his wife to have an abortion before she disappeared. The judge called the evidence relevant to show motive ""in the disappearance of Kathie Durst"" as well as Berman's murder.  The state is expected to call to the stand Nathan ""Nick"" Chavin, who told the court at a 2017 pretrial hearing that Durst was the best man at his wedding. He testified of marital problems festering until McCormack ""said she was afraid"" of Durst. ""On one occasion, she cried,"" Chavin said. ""She was appealing to me as Bob's friend to understand she was having a terrible time with her marriage."" Durst has said the last time he saw his wife was after she boarded a train near their suburban New York home, headed for the city to resume her studies at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx. Prosecutors say she never got on that train. They have said Durst allegedly killed her and asked Berman to help cover up the crime. Chavin testified that Berman told him Durst killed his wife. He also told the court that Durst confessed to him in 2014 that he killed Berman to keep her quiet. ""I had to. It was her or me,"" Durst said, according to Chavin, as reported by the Los Angeles Times. ""I had no choice."" The defense has called Chavin less than reliable, indicating they may try to call to the stand a New York Times reporter who interviewed Chavin. The defense believes Chavin's interview with the Times might conflict with his testimony. He was arrested in New Orleans before final episode of 'The Jinx' aired The Los Angeles jury will also hear about Durst's 2003 murder trial in Texas in which he admitted killing neighbor Morris Black in Galveston and chopping up the body. He was acquitted after his attorneys argued he had acted in self-defense, though he later served nine months in prison on felony weapons charges stemming from that case. ""What happened in Galveston was 12 jurors agreed that Bob Durst acted in self-defense and he panicked, and that was a jury that heard all of the evidence,"" DeGuerin said last month. ""I just don't think we should be trying that again."" In 2003, prosecutors had argued that Durst planned Black's killing to steal his identity. But defense attorneys said Black sneaked into Durst's apartment, and he accidentally shot him as both men struggled for a gun.  Durst testified he panicked and decided to cut up Black's body and throw away the pieces. ""I could understand Durst's panic,"" juror Joanne Gongora said after Durst's acquittal in 2003.  Durst was arrested in New Orleans in March 2015, one day before the final episode of ""The Jinx"" aired. Investigators said he was preparing for a life on the lam when FBI agents picked him up at a hotel under an assumed name. He had more than $40,000 in cash -- and a latex mask that could cover his head and neck to alter his appearance, according to court documents.   ""Being a fugitive is not something I did well,"" Durst told Lewin. ""I hated being a fugitive. I would walk down the street and turn around and ... start looking over my shoulder. And, you know, (I) was just the worst fugitive the world has ever met."""

144,CNN,"Intelligence Community Inspector General, Michael Atkinson, is among those atop the line of succession to be named acting DNI should Trump fail to name a replacement or nominate a candidate for Senate confirmation by the March 11 deadline.     Politico was first to report Klitenic's departure.  Last fall, Klitenic's handling of the whistleblower complaint came under scrutiny after he consulted with DOJ and decided to block its transmittal to Congress despite the fact that the Intelligence Community Inspector General had determined that it was of ""urgent concern."" That prompted a letter from House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Adam Schiff demanding the complaint be handed over. In his response, Klitenic acknowledged that he had consulted with DOJ and determined that the matter did not, in fact, rise to the level of urgent concern. ""In this instance, the ICIG transmitted to the DNI a complaint, that he viewed as an urgent concern, and we reviewed that report immediately upon receipt. Because there were serious questions about whether the complaint met the statutory definition of an ""urgent concern"" under 50 U.S.C. § 3033(k)(5), we consulted with DOJ concerning the appropriate way to handle the complaint,"" he wrote on September 13. ""Based on those consultations, we determined that the allegations did not fall within the statutory definition of an ""urgent concern"" and that the statute did not require the complaint to be transmitted to the intelligence committees,"" Klitenic added. Klitenic's initial refusal ultimately led to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision to open an impeachment inquiry -- which facilitated the release of the whistleblower complaint and a partial transcript of Trump's July 25 call with his Ukrainian counterpart. Maguire also testified before Congress as part of the probe. ""This is going to be the thing that defined his term in office,"" Bob Litt, former ODNI General Counsel and Klitenic's predecessor, told CNN.  Litt also said that he thought Klitenic handled the whistleblower complaint ""entirely appropriately"" and as a result never made himself a target of the administration.   Prior to serving as ODNI General Counsel, Klitenic was a partner at the law firm of Holland & Knight LLP, according to his agency bio.  Earlier in his career, served as Deputy General Counsel of the US Department of Homeland Security and Deputy Associate Attorney General of the US Department of Justice, it says. "

146,CNN,"On Sunday, Hubei announced new measures, including province-wide traffic restrictions on all non-emergency vehicles and the closure of all non-essential public venues. Already there are reports of residential compounds being completely sealed off, with no one able to go in or out except in rare circumstances.  Health screening is to be stepped up, with officials going door-to-door to look for new cases. Anyone displaying potential symptoms ""should be immediately reported to the local community or village,"" the government said in a circular announcing the new restrictions.  Anyone suspected or confirmed to be infected with the virus, their close contacts, or anyone with a fever, should be ""timely treated or placed in quarantine instead of self-isolation at home,"" it said.  On the economic side, Hubei said that ""companies should not resume production unless allowed by local epidemic prevention authorities."" When did Xi know? Officials in Hubei have faced increasing scrutiny about whether they intentionally downplayed reports of the virus when it emerged late last year, or ignored evidence that it was being spread from person-to-person, delaying any efforts to contain it before it was too late.  Multiple officials have been removed from their positions, while others have offered to resign. It had been thought that any blame for the delay in response was contained to Hubei itself, and that central authorities were as in the dark as the international community until late January, when Chinese President Xi Jinping stepped in himself, ordering ""all out efforts"" to rein in the virus' spread.  Over the weekend, however, a transcript of a speech Xi gave earlier this month was published. In it, Xi said he first ""issued requirements for the prevention and control of the new coronavirus"" on January 7. While the speech underlines that Xi has been personally directing the response to the outbreak -- something that has been repeatedly emphasized in state media -- the revelation that he knew about the virus when Hubei officials were publicly downplaying its danger, exposes him to the risk of being blamed, along with them, for failing to properly handle the outbreak in its early weeks. It also raises additional questions for the World Health Organization (WHO), which has previously praised China for its ""transparency"" and for sounding the alarm early and enabling a global response to the virus.  China is not only sending mixed messages over when and what Xi knew. With the country facing increasing economic pressure -- which could have global ramifications -- many cities are attempting to return to something like normality.  Speaking last week, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang urged continued efforts ""to advance science-based epidemic control, and resume production in an orderly way to better support outbreak response and preserve normal economic and social order."" A specially customized train left Guizhou in western China for Hangzhou carrying around 300 migrant workers, state media reported. Carriages have ""strict temperature monitoring, better ventilation and scattered seating,"" and it is hoped it could be a model for returning workers to travel while not being exposed to potential infection. At the same time, however, cities and provinces most affected by the outbreak are facing stringent new controls, on top of existing lockdowns which have left people trapped inside their homes and unable to work.  Increase in cases There have been more than 71,000 cases of coronavirus worldwide, with the vast majority of those in mainland China. The largest outbreaks outside of China have been in Singapore and Japan, where the Diamond Princess cruise ship has been docked for almost two weeks now, while health officials tested the thousands of passengers and crew on board.  So far, more than 456 cases have been confirmed aboard the ship, with 99 cases confirmed by Japanese health authorities on Monday. More are expected before the official end of the quarantine period, after which Japanese officials said it would take two or three days for passengers to disembark, during which they will be tested once again.  Hundreds of Americans on board the ship were able to leave Sunday, on a specially-chartered flight organized by the US government. They are swapping one quarantine for another, however, with US authorities saying Saturday that on their return stateside, the passengers will have to undergo another two-weeks of observation and testing at one of two military bases.  Global spread Taiwanese authorities on Sunday reported the island's first death from Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus.  The man in his mid-60s tested had a history of hepatitis B and diabetes and no history of traveling abroad. His death came as another case was confirmed in Taiwan, bringing the total number of cases on the island to 20.  While the vast majority of deaths have occurred in mainland China, there have been fatal cases of the virus in Hong Kong, the Philippines, Japan and France. Cases of the virus have been confirmed in more than two dozen countries worldwide, affecting nearly every continent.  ""Right now we're in an aggressive containment mode,"" Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), told CNN last week. ""We don't know a lot about this virus. This virus is probably with us beyond this season, beyond this year, and I think eventually the virus will find a foothold and we will get community-based transmission."" While more research is needed to fully understand the virus, Redfield said that the CDC has focused on surveillance to track cases and containment strategies to slow possible progression of the virus in the US.  Slowing progression gives more time for researchers to work on developing and testing a vaccine and antiviral drugs for this novel coronavirus. Currently, there is no known cure for the virus."
147,CNN,"The revelation raises major questions about whether it was the central government, not authorities in Hubei, who dithered on their response, allowing the virus to spread through the country and eventually the world. It also underlines the difficulty in maintaining Xi's image -- carefully cultivated by state media -- as an almost omniscient ruler who oversees, and is aware of everything that is happening in the country. With criticism growing of the failure to contain the coronavirus, both at home and abroad, Beijing was faced with either choosing to admit that Xi was ignorant of the true nature of the crisis until almost a month into it, or that he was aware of it and involved in the response. By choosing the latter option, however, no matter how much blame can be placed onto provincial officials for failing to ""implement"" Xi's instructions, the government is admitting that ultimate responsibility for the outbreak lies with the man at the center.  Who knew? In the transcript of the speech, published Saturday by the official Communist Party journal Qiushi, Xi ""issued requirements for the prevention and control of the new coronavirus"" during a meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee, China's most powerful decision making body on January 7.  He gave further instructions on January 20 and two days later, when he ""explicitly requested Hubei province to implement comprehensive and strict control over the outflow of people"" -- essentially placing the province on lockdown.  ""I have, at all times, monitored the spread of the epidemic and the progress in prevention and control work, and continue to give oral orders and instructions,"" Xi is reported to have said. It is the 13-day period between January 7 and 20 that is most crucial, not least because it is when officials in Hubei held two key provincial Party meetings and Wuhan invited more than 40,000 families to attend a mass banquet in an attempt to set a world record. It's also when officials in both Wuhan and Hubei appeared to downplay the outbreak, an assessment that was repeated by state officials: Wang Guangfa, head of a team of researchers sent from Beijing to investigate the situation, said on January 11 that it was under control.  Wang, like others on the front line during the initial outbreak, was subsequently diagnosed with the virus. Provincial officials have faced intense criticism for their handling of the crisis during this period, coming as it did in the run up to the Lunar New Year travel period, in which hundreds of millions of people criss-cross the country. Passenger screening was not put in place in Wuhan -- itself a major international and domestic travel hub -- until January 14 and further restrictions over a week later.  Wuhan Mayor Zhou Xianwang later admitted that the city's ""warnings were not sufficient,"" and offered to resign.  ""We understand that the public is unsatisfied with our information disclosure. On one hand, we failed to disclose relevant information in a timely manner; on the other, we did not make sufficient use of valid information to improve our work,"" Zhou said in an interview with state broadcaster CCTV. ""As for the late disclosure, I hope the public can understand that it's an infectious disease, and relevant information should be released according to the law. As a local government, we can only disclose information after being authorized."" Zhou's reference to being authorized to release information was initially seen as something of an attempt to cover his own back, by pushing some of the responsibility onto his superiors. But if Xi was directing the response at this point, then Zhou may have indeed been waiting for guidance from Beijing before he did anything, and any blame for his inaction may lie elsewhere.  Xi at the center Wu Qiang, a Beijing-based political analyst who specializes in analyzing Xi's speeches, described the recently published address as ""unprecedented"" during an interview with the South China Morning Post. ""It sounds like he is defending and explaining how he has done everything in his capacity to lead epidemic prevention,"" said Wu. In recent weeks, there has been an apparent effort to push any blame for the crisis onto provincial officials, who either misled Beijing or failed to implement the Party leadership's instructions. This was exemplified by China's ambassador to the US, Cui Tiankai, who said in an interview with NPR on Saturday that ""you cannot talk in very general terms 'the government' (in China).""  ""Sometimes government at a particular level makes some mistakes. This is possible. This is, I think it is all natural all over the world,"" he said. ""But you cannot say the whole government in China is making a mistake. This is not true.""  This was already something of an awkward narrative for Xi, who has amassed more power than any Chinese leader since Mao Zedong and severely ramped up internal discipline within the Communist Party. By emphasizing his personal involvement in the response from an early stage, Xi has potentially undermined that narrative even further -- you can't blame local officials for their failures, and then reveal you were watching them the entire time.  Ultimately, however, the awkwardness of sharing some of the blame with Hubei officials might be preferable than admitting that Xi and those around him were potentially unaware or ill informed about what was really going on."

152,CNN,"CNN reported earlier Tuesday that the Philippines has sent a letter to US officials terminating the Visiting Forces Agreement, according to the Filipino Presidential spokesperson Salvador Panelo. While this is not the only military agreement between the two countries, its seen as a formal downgrading of its long standing military alliance between the two countries in the South China Sea.    The Philippines and China each claim overlapping areas of the vast sea, along with multiple other countries including Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei.  In a press conference held on Tuesday, Panelo confirmed that President Rodrigo Duterte directed the Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea and Secretary of Foreign Affairs Teodoro Locsin to send the notice of termination to the United States government.  Panelo said that President Donald Trump and Duterte have not talked and that no response it needed from the US government in order for the termination process to proceed. The termination will be effective ""180 days from the receipt of the notice of termination from the US government,"" he added. ""The President said it is about time we rely on our own resources, we have to strengthen our own capability as a country relative to the defense of our land,"" Panelo said when asked why the Visiting Forces Agreement was terminated.  Relations between China and the Philippines have warmed considerably since the 2016 inauguration of Duterte, who has pushed for a closer economic relationship with Beijing. ""I need China. More than anybody else at this point, I need China,"" Duterte said before flying to China in April 2018. Compared with his predecessors, Duterte has viewed the dispute in the South China Sea as more negotiable than a matter of principle. But China has been strengthening its hold over the region. In May 2018, Beijing announced it had successfully landed bombers on islands under its control for the first time, a big step in the militarization of the region. Trump met with Duterte during a visit to Manila in 2017 and has previously praised the controversial Philippine leader's violent drug crackdown which has drawn international scorn and was expected to test Trump's penchant for diplomatic flattery. ""I just wanted to congratulate you because I am hearing of the unbelievable job on the drug problem,"" Trump told the Philippine President in their first call in 2017, according to a leaked transcript obtained by The Washington Post."

154,CNN,"Trump spoke at an arena at Southern Hampshire University that has a capacity of just more than 11,000. Also on Monday, Bernie Sanders had a crowd of 7,500 for his final major rally before the New Hampshire primary. Which, because math, makes Trump's prediction not right.   3. ""And the fake news, these guys, will never report that. They'll never report that."" Just did. 4. ""We have never had an empty seat from the day your future first lady and I came down the escalator. Never. Not one."" Patently false.  5. ""The most prosperity -- we have got the most prosperity we've ever had."" It's not entirely clear what measure Trump is using to gauge ""most prosperity."" If he is looking at Gross Domestic Product (the total value of all good and service produced by America), he's right that it is the highest it has ever been. But GDP has also been on a steady upward trajectory since the 1960s. 6. ""On Tuesday I delivered my address on the State of the Union. And I had somebody behind me who was mumbling terribly. Mumbling. Mumbling. Wha. Ho. Ha."" Trump is referring here to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California. And it's not clear that his claims about her mumbling are, well, true. Also, after Trump said this, the crowd started chanting ""Lock her up"" -- although it's not clear what specific crime they thought Pelosi had committed. 7.

While he has repeatedly blamed that loss on scores of Massachusetts voters being bused into New Hampshire to (illegally) vote for Clinton, he's never provided any evidence to back up the claim. And fact-checkers have found the claim to be false. 10. ""And now you get prosecuted if you do what they did. So it should be a lot different but we have done great."" Again there is zero evidence ""they"" did anything. 11. ""People come up to me, they say, 'I want to thank you. My wife thinks I am a total loser, sir.

Trump tells this story about Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise regularly on the campaign trail. Scalise was badly wounded when a man opened fire at House Republicans practicing for the congressional baseball game in 2017.

The poem ""The Snake"" was a fixture at Trump's 2016 rallies. And the daughters of the civil rights activist who wrote it have asked Trump to stop using it. He, uh, hasn't. 25. ""The Democrat Party wants to run your health care but they can't even run a caucus in Iowa."" This is a good line -- and inevitable, given the cluster that was the Iowa caucuses. 26. ""Actually I think they're trying to take it away from Bernie again. I think Bernie came in second. Can you believe it? They're doing it to you again, Bernie. They're doing it to you again."" It's no secret that Trump's advisers believe that the Vermont democratic socialist is the weakest opponent in November. And so, Trump has long been a ""supporter"" of the idea that the Democratic establishment is trying to keep Bernie from winning. 27. ""We are protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will."" Nope! 28. ""We should impeach President Obama."" (raises hand tentatively) He's not, um, the President anymore? 29.

Concord, that's the same Concord that we read about all the time. Right? Concord. I love Concord."" Trump appears to think that Concord, New Hampshire (the state's capital) is the same Concord as the one in the famous Revolutionary War battle. That one is in Massachusetts. 31.

157,CNN,"On Friday, as the news emerged, a senior Ukrainian defense official said that with Vindman's departure from the National Security Council, his country is left with no real point-person at the White House. In recent months, the Ukrainian government -- and its embassy in Washington -- had used Vindman as a main point of contact inside the NSC.  Vindman is a country expert and speaks both Ukrainian and Russian. He told House investigators that the President's request to have Ukraine investigate the Bidens appeared like a ""partisan play"" and said he did not think it was proper to make such a demand of a foreign government. Other officials the Ukrainian government dealt with included Fiona Hill and Timothy Morrison, who served back-to-back as NSC director for Europe and Russia. Hill and Morrison have both left government, and Morrison's successor, Andrew Peek, abruptly left the NSC last month. ""We don't really know who to deal with at this point,"" the Ukrainian official said. The National Security Council didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Vindman's successor.  Paul Stronski, a former NSC official specialized in Eastern Europe, and now a senior fellow in Carnegie's Russia and Eurasia Program, said the latest firings resemble ""a Soviet-style purge.""  ""In the Soviet era there was an effort, albeit much more brutal, to undermine the official laws and procedures to get rid of one's real or perceived enemies and if you have a difference of opinion you could easily be kicked out of the party, kicked out of your government position, and they went after family members as well,"" he said.  Bill Taylor, who until recently served as the top US diplomat in Ukraine, retired from the foreign service last month. Taylor replaced Marie Yovanovitch, whose early removal as US ambassador to Ukraine last spring was a key point of interest in the House impeachment inquiry. Yovanovitch, who had been on leave since she was recalled from Kiev last year, formerly retired from the foreign service last week. Another impeachment witness, Kurt Volker, the US Special Representative for Ukraine, has not been replaced since he left the role last year, however two other witnesses -- George Kent and Philip Reeker, remain in their roles at the State Department and are active on Ukraine-related matters, with one US official saying Kent is now the US diplomat dealing with the government in Kiev. ""We hear from a number of our closest allies working together on Ukraine... and they are all deeply concerned that there is no one really steering the ship on this policy and it's disconcerting,"" said Jonathan Katz, a former State Department and USAID official specialized in Eastern Europe, and a current fellow at The German Marshall Fund of the United States. In White House meetings and talks with foreign leaders, Trump has repeatedly described Ukraine as ""totally corrupt"" and full of ""terrible people,"" according to current and former administration officials. He has repeatedly expressed his reluctance to engage with Kiev and has instead called upon European nations to do more to help Ukraine. Last month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo allegedly unleashed a profanity-laced tirade on an NPR reporter who asked him about Ukraine during an interview he presumed would focus on Iran. ""He was not happy to have been questioned about Ukraine,"" the reporter, Mary Louise Kelly explained on ""All Things Considered."" ""He asked, do you think Americans care about Ukraine? He used the F-word in that sentence and many others."" When the news of Pompeo's comments emerged, Taylor penned an editorial in The New York Times noting that Americans should care about Ukraine. ""Ukraine is defending itself and the West against Russian attack. If Ukraine succeeds, we succeed. The relationship between the United States and Ukraine is key to our national security, and Americans should care about Ukraine,"" Taylor wrote. Emails and documents reviewed by CNN earlier this week related to the aid freeze painted a broad picture of bureaucrats scrambling to understand and push back against a sudden, unexplained White House directive that disrupted months of careful planning, contradicted Pentagon decisions based on US national security concerns and undermined Ukraine's efforts to defend itself against Russia. Trump has maintained that he hopes to establish better ties with Moscow, repairing ill will from the Obama era that resulted from Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region. Katz said there is genuine concern among foreign policy professionals -- in and outside of government --  that a second Trump term would result in recognition of Russia's claims over Crimea as a way to appease President Vladimir Putin. ""There is universal concern that in a second Trump term he would really turn quickly on Ukraine and try to strike a deal with Putin -- and a quick way to do that would be recognizing Russia's claims over Ukraine,"" Katz said.  Still, earlier this week, Trump's current national security adviser Robert O'Brien defended the Trump administration's Ukraine policy, saying that it provided Javelin anti-tank missiles to Ukraine -- something Ukraine desperately wanted and never got from the Obama administration. The emails and documents reviewed by CNN revealed US officials were still working to expedite the delivery of the Javelin missiles to the country just two days before the hold on military aid to Ukraine was announced. This story has been updated with additional reporting."
158,CNN,"""I was advised today that the President intends to recall me effective immediately as United States Ambassador to the European Union,"" Sondland said. ""I am grateful to President Trump for having given me the opportunity to serve, to Secretary Pompeo for his consistent support, and to the exceptional and dedicated professionals at the U.S. Mission to the European Union. I am proud of our accomplishments. Our work here has been the highlight of my career."" The dismissals appear to be retribution for Vindman and Sondland's explosive testimonies to the House impeachment probe late last year, both of which were done under subpoena. The duo gave some of the most damning testimony to House impeachment investigators during last fall's public hearings and quickly became targets for Trump's supporters, both inside and outside of government. The firings come two days after the Senate voted to acquit Trump on two articles of impeachment in votes that were largely along party lines. Trump had continued to fume privately about Vindman's testimony during the impeachment inquiry and foreshadowed his dismissal earlier Friday. ""Well, I'm not happy with him,"" Trump said. ""You think I'm supposed to be happy with him? I'm not."" Sondland's ties to the White House and Trump had deteriorated since his testimony. A person familiar with the situation says Sondland's ties to the White House and Trump had frayed badly since he testified last year. He once had Trump effectively on speed-dial, or the presidential equivalent of it, but since his appearance he hasn't spoken with Trump. He was also pulled from overseeing the Ukraine portfolio, which wasn't directly related to his position as EU ambassador.  Vindman dismissed early Vindman, a decorated veteran who was born in Ukraine, was escorted out of the White House by security and told his services were no longer needed, according to his lawyer, David Pressman. Pressman said in a statement that it is clear he was fired for testifying in the impeachment probe. ""There is no question in the mind of any American why this man's job is over, why this country now has one less soldier serving it at the White House,"" Pressman said. ""LTC Vindman was asked to leave for telling the truth. His honor, his commitment to right, frightened the powerful."" He added, ""Truth is not partisan. If we allow truthful voices to be silenced, if we ignore their warnings, eventually there will be no one left to warn us."" His twin brother, Lt. Col. Yevgeny Vindman, a National Security Council attorney, was also fired, ""suddenly and with no explanation, despite over two decades of loyal service to this country,"" Pressman said, and walked off the White House grounds alongside Alex Vindman.  Yevgeny Vindman had never testified or spoke publicly about the Ukraine saga. ""He deeply regrets that he will not be able to continue his service at the White House,"" Pressman said in a statement. Before the impeachment inquiry was launched, the Vindman brothers often arrived at work together.   National Security Council spokesman John Ullyot said: ""We do not comment on personnel matters."" Vindman is expected to return to the Pentagon, though it's still unclear what his assignment will be until he's expected to attend war college this summer.  ""We welcome back all of our service members, wherever they serve, to any assignment they are given,"" Defense Secretary Mark Esper had said Friday when asked about Vindman's expected ouster.  ""We can confirm that both Lt. Cols. Vindman have been reassigned to the Department of the Army, out of respect for their privacy, we will not be providing any further information at this time,"" an Army spokesperson said. The vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. John Hyten, told CNN that ""it will be up to the Army"" to determine where Alex Vindman goes next. ""But I'm sure there's still room for his talents in the United States Army, it's just not in the current job,"" he said. While Vindman had only learned from news reports late Thursday night of the potential White House plan to fire him, he'd been steeling himself for this moment since he testified in Trump's impeachment hearing in November, according to a source familiar. Of the friends and family reaching out in support of the Purple Heart recipient amid the subsequent attacks from Trump and his allies, some also warned of likely retribution.   One source who spoke with Vindman recently said the veteran originally hoped he could continue to be effective in his role at the National Security Council post-testimony, but was quickly marginalized when he returned to work. ""Alex was a bit naïve about it at first -- because he believed that since he did what he thought was right, things would work out,"" a source close to him said. ""But it eventually became clear that wasn't how things were going to go this time.""   Vindman had told lawmakers during his November congressional testimony that he reported concerns about Trump's July 25 call with the leader of Ukraine to the top National Security Council lawyer within hours of the call, and that some of the changes he tried to make to the since-published transcript were left out, though he didn't say why. Vindman also told lawmakers that later, he was told not to discuss the call with anyone else. Vindman -- who was awarded a Purple Heart for his service in Iraq after being wounded in an IED attack and still carries shrapnel from the attack in his body, according to a source close to him -- also told lawmakers how his family had fled to the US from the Soviet Union when he was a child. ""The privilege of serving my country is not only rooted in my military service, but also in my personal history. I sit here, as a lieutenant colonel in the United States Army, an immigrant,"" he said. ""My family fled the Soviet Union when I was three-and-a-half years old. Upon arriving in New York City in 1979, my father worked multiple jobs to support us, all the while learning English at night. He stressed to us the importance of fully integrating into our adopted country."" Vindman served multiple overseas tours, including in South Korea and Germany in addition to his deployment to Iraq, according to his prepared remarks. But now the intense and public backlash from the President and his supporters has put Vindman's future in the military in question. ""If Alex could stay in the Army forever he would. If he could go continue his career without [the impeachment testimony] following him around for the rest of his life, he would. But it's not clear he can,"" said a source familiar with the situation. Sondland connected Trump to quid pro quo Sondland's dismissal comes nearly three months after he connected Trump directly to the ""quid pro quo"" trading Ukrainian investigations into Trump's political opponents for official actions, including a White House meeting, during damning testimony before House impeachment investigators. Sondland, a political appointee and hotel magnate with no background in government before joining the Trump administration, testified in November that he was working with Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani on Ukraine matters at the ""express direction of the President of the United States.""  He also recounted several conversations between himself and Trump about Ukraine opening two investigations: one into Burisma, a company where former Vice President Joe Biden's son was on the board, and another into conspiracies about Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 US election. ""Everyone was in the loop. It was no secret. Everyone was informed via email on July 19, days before the presidential call,"" Sondland said. While Sondland said Trump had never expressly told him that US military assistance was contingent on Ukraine announcing investigations into Burisma and the 2016 election, the ambassador said he was ""under the impression that, absolutely, it was contingent."" Though the new comments corroborated testimony from other witnesses and contradicted Trump, who had said all along that there was no quid pro quo with Ukraine, he didn't go as far as some of the other witnesses in his statements. Sondland said Trump withheld a White House invitation from the new Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, until Zelensky announced the investigations. Other witnesses testified that US military assistance was also part of the quid pro quo, but Sondland said Trump never mentioned the foreign aid component. Still, the testimony ruined Sondland's standing in Trump's orbit. ""Sondland was a dead man walking,"" a current US official told CNN. ""We all knew it was coming and it was going to happen fast, it was just a question of when Trump was going to do it."" Even other US ambassadors who were appointed by Trump and had been close to Sondland tried to maintain an arms-length distance from him, knowing that Trump had turned on him, the official said.  A source close to Sondland told CNN ""there's no other job for him"" in the Trump administration. He had resisted resigning, a source familiar with the situation told CNN. In Brussels, a diplomatic source told CNN that Sondland had seen his status diminished in the eyes of his diplomatic counterparts. They want to work with someone who has proximity to the President, and after Sondland testified, it was clear he didn't, the source said.  Sondland, who was confirmed to the ambassador role in June 2018, has been a player in Republican politics for a number of years but wasn't always a Trump supporter. During the 2016 election, he donated to Jeb Bush's presidential campaign and to the former Florida governor's Super PAC, FEC filings show. After Trump locked up the nomination, Sondland, a frequent donor to the Republican National Committee, joined Trump and the RNC's joint finance operation, and eventually donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee through four limited liability companies, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Sondland was previously the founder and CEO of the Provenance Hotels chain, which boasts 19 hotels across the country. This story has been updated with reaction and further details."

160,CNN,"""The United States Office of Senate Security is in possession of a number of classified documents provided by the executive branch departments and agencies. Much of this information appears to be marked at classification levels that are properly aligned with the nature of the information contained in them. However, some documents contain information that is classified at a level that appears inconsistent with the nature of the material,"" the Connecticut Democrat wrote. ""I request that GAO compare a sample of classified documents held by the Office of Senate Security to the original classified versions an underlying source materials held by the respective executive branch departments and agencies to determine the extent to which the classification levels are the same,"" he added.  Murphy's letter comes one day after Trump's Senate impeachment acquittal -- a ruling that was handed down despite acknowledgment from many Republicans that the President's actions toward Ukraine were improper.  The White House released a partial transcript of Trump's now infamous July 25 call with Zelensky in September as the whistleblower complaint was made public.  The whistleblower alleged that White House officials tried to ""lock down"" all records of that July conversation with the Ukrainian leader and the full transcript has not been released. Trump has repeatedly insisted the call was perfect despite bipartisan acknowledgment that it was not.  Documents related to Pence's September call with Zelensky have also not been released though it was addressed in witness testimony during the House proceedings.  While the Senate voted Wednesday to acquit the President, the complete story of what happened between Trump and Ukraine still hasn't been told.  Murphy's request also relates to classified documents outside of the impeachment inquiry, including the War Powers notification that was sent to Congress in January following the strike that killed Soleimani and another unsuccessful operation targeting an Iranian military official in Yemen. That notification cites Article II and the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) as legal justifications but does not make an explicit connection between each individual action and a specific authority, sources told CNN last month. Democrats have questioned the administration's motives for keeping the notification classified, particularly as they say officials have struggled to articulate why ordering the military action without informing Congress ahead of time was lawful."
161,CNN,"What did Trump say about the aid freeze? Even some top Republicans concede that Trump ordered a freeze of US military assistance for Ukraine and withheld those funds to extract political favors from the Ukrainian government. Multiple impeachment witnesses testified that to that effect. But the impeachment inquiry didn't uncover firsthand evidence that the President had explicitly told anyone that this was the true rationale behind the freeze. And Trump's lawyers vigorously contested that point during his Senate trial, arguing that the aid was paused for legitimate policy reasons.  Key aides who spoke with Trump about the freeze -- Bolton, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo -- refused to cooperate with the House inquiry. We don't know how Trump's aides first explained the freeze to the White House budget office.  As the trial wrapped up, the first details of Trump's private explanation trickled out. Bolton's book will reveal that the President said he wouldn't release the money until Ukraine announced investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading 2020 rival. Whatever else Bolton and the others say on this topic could be the smoking gun Democrats wanted all along. What else does Bolton know? The Bolton bombshells have been significant, and there might be more to come. The question is whether things will leak early or come out when his book is released March 17. Bolton already revealed that Trump told him about the quid pro quo for military assistance. Bolton also revealed that Trump told him to encourage Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to meet with his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, who was spreading smears about the Bidens and pressing Ukrainians to investigate.   But Bolton also attended a pivotal White House meeting with Ukrainian officials, where the quid pro quo was mentioned, according to testimony from impeachment witnesses. He met personally with Zelensky during a trip to Kiev in August. He was in touch with other key players, like US diplomat Bill Taylor and former White House aide Fiona Hill. There's probably a lot of new information about these episodes in his forthcoming book.  At least one top House Democrat said it's ""likely"" they'll subpoena Bolton to testify, though it's unclear how that would work out. Bolton didn't cooperate with the House impeachment inquiry last year but said he would testify in the Senate. Republicans defeated multiple attempts by Democrats to subpoena him during the Senate trial.  When did Zelensky learn about the freeze? Trump's lawyers repeatedly said the Ukrainians didn't learn about the aid freeze until Politico wrote about it on August 28. These claims have already been contradicted by testimony from a senior Pentagon official and by comments from one former aide to Zelensky -- they both said the Ukrainians learned that there was a problem as early as July.  It's a complicated picture. Some Zelensky aides said they didn't know until the Politico article. Zelensky is on the record saying that ""nobody pushed me"" on the Biden investigations and that he had been unaware of the freeze during his July 25 phone call with Trump. What is clear is that Zelensky raised the issue directly with Vice President Mike Pence on September 1.   Democrats and foreign policy experts have speculated that Zelensky downplayed the pressure campaign because he still relies on US help for Ukraine's ongoing war with Russian-backed insurgents. Zelensky alluded to this in an interview where he criticized the freeze: ""If you're our strategic partner, then you can't go blocking anything for us. ... It just goes without saying."" The timeline of when Zelensky learned about the freeze still has some holes. If his denials hold up, that would affirm an important element of Trump's defense. If not -- all bets are off.  Was Pompeo 'in the loop' the whole time? For his part, Pompeo has defended Trump's controversial actions, dismissed the impeachment proceedings as partisan ""noise"" and maintained that US policy toward Ukraine never changed.  He has also successfully dodged questions about his role in the Ukraine affair. He's been tight-lipped about his contacts with Giuliani and whether he knew that Trump wanted investigations into the Bidens. One diplomat who was directly involved, US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, testified that Pompeo was ""in the loop"" about the efforts to pressure Zelensky.  There are plenty of other lingering questions, particularly in light of Pompeo's silence when it comes to defending the diplomats who were part of the proceedings. When did he learn about efforts by Trump and Giuliani to remove then-US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch? Did he defend Yovanovitch to Trump or try to stop her recall from Kiev? Pompeo is a strong Trump ally. It seems unlikely he'll tell a different story after leaving office. But transparency groups have succeeded at prying loose some documents from the State Department, so it's likely more public evidence will emerge about Pompeo's involvement.  How involved was Mulvaney? Democrats claim that Mulvaney was a central player, contending he implemented the freeze and knows the truth about the quid pro quo. He's a close Trump ally who began his career in the administration overseeing the budget office that carried out the President's orders by issuing a series of holds on the Ukraine assistance.  Mulvaney ignored Democrats' subpoenas and Senate Republicans killed numerous attempts to have him testify. But in a shocking news conference last year, he brashly admitted that Trump had withheld the aid because he wanted Ukraine to investigate its own alleged election meddling in 2016. (Trump believes the conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered to defeat his campaign.)   The New York Times reported that there are emails that shed new light on Mulvaney's role, including messages about the aid freeze. But those emails are owned by the White House, which didn't turn over any documents during Trump's impeachment. As a result, House Democrats charged the President with obstruction of Congress, but he was acquitted by the Senate.   Was Barr aware of the pressure campaign? Trump mentioned Attorney General William Barr five times during his July call with Zelensky. After the White House released the rough transcript in November, the Justice Department issued a series of carefully worded statements distancing Barr from the burgeoning scandal.  They said Barr had learned about the call ""several weeks"" later, even though Trump said he'd put Barr in touch with Zelensky. Trump never spoke with Barr about ""having Ukraine investigate anything"" related to Biden. Barr never discussed ""anything relating to Ukraine"" with Giuliani.  But one player, indicted Giuliani associate Lev Parnas, says Barr knows more than he's letting on. Parnas told CNN that Barr was aware of Giuliani's activities in Ukraine, which included a deal with an oligarch to obtain damaging material about Biden. In exchange, two Republican lawyers tried unsuccessfully to convince Barr to drop criminal charges against the oligarch.  The Justice Department received multiple criminal referrals regarding Trump's call with Zelensky. Prosecutors reviewed the call but decided within a few weeks not to investigate whether the call violated campaign finance laws. House Democrats could use their oversight powers to figure out why the review was so narrow, and whether Barr was involved in handling the criminal referrals. Did Trump ever tell anyone to lie to the public? Trump, his White House aides and his lawyers have also issued dozens of denials that may not stand the test of time. They denied that the President had withheld Ukraine funds because of the Bidens, that he had been trying to gain an advantage for the next election, that he knows Parnas and that he had directed Giuliani to pressure any Ukrainians. Some of these denials have already been debunked by key witnesses who testified. Parnas has accused Trump of lying about his knowledge of the pressure campaign. It all raises the serious question of whether Trump asked or ordered anyone to lie to the public about the Ukraine affair. The President has spread dozens of lies and falsehoods about Ukraine. And special counsel Robert Mueller uncovered several occasions when Trump had ordered aides to lie during the Russia investigation. The most shocking example was when the President told former White House Counsel Don McGahn to deny an accurate news report about Trump's attempt to fire Mueller.  What will happen to the criminal investigation? While impeachment proceedings unfolded on Capitol Hill, a related criminal investigation was progressing in Manhattan. Federal prosecutors indicted Parnas, his associate Igor Fruman and two others in a campaign finance scheme involving foreign funds and straw donors, and an unsuccessful attempt to remove Yovanovitch in 2018. All four defendants pleaded not guilty.  The investigation is ongoing and widening. Last year CNN reported that investigators were looking at Giuliani's finances and also had opened a counterintelligence investigation. Federal prosecutors said they expect to bring more criminal charges, which could touch on the efforts to work with Ukrainian officials to influence US policy, as alluded to in the original indictment.  Parnas has been angling for a cooperation deal with prosecutors, and could turn on his partners, and even Giuliani, who has a wide array of foreign clients and opaque finances. He was paid $500,000 from Parnas' company and it's still not entirely clear where the money originated. And Giuliani joined Trump's legal team two years ago but says he's working for free.   If there isn't a deal, Parnas and the others are scheduled to go on trial in October. The next steps in the criminal probe could revive the Ukraine scandal after impeachment is long gone."
162,CNN,"TRUMP:  Had I not fired James Comey -- who was a disaster, by the way -- it's possible I wouldn't even be standing here right now. We caught him in the act. Dirty cops, bad people. If this happened to President Obama, a lot of people would have been in jail for a long time already, many, many years. I want to start by thanking some of -- and I call them friends because, you know, you develop friendships and relationships when you're in battle and war, much more so than, ""Gee, let's have a normal situation."" TRUMP: With all that we've gone through, we've done, I think, more than any president and administration and, really, I say, for the most part, Republican congressmen, congresswomen and Republican senators. We've done more than any administration in the first few years, you look at all of the things we've done. I watched, this morning, as they tried to take credit for the stock market from... (LAUGHTER) ... from -- think of that. Let me tell you, if we didn't win, the stock market would have crashed. And the market was going up a lot before the election because it was looking like we had a good chance to win. And then it went up tremendously from the time we won the election until the time we took office, which was November 8th to January 20th. And that's our credit, that's all our credit. And leading up to that point was our credit because there was hope. TRUMP: And one of the reasons the stock market's gone up so much in the last few days is people think we're doing so well. They liked the State of the Union speech. (APPLAUSE). It really is. It's a true honor to give it. Making the State of the Union speech, I was with some people that have been around. They've been all over the world. And one of them said -- highly sophisticated person said, ""You know, no matter where you go in the world, it doesn't make any difference:  There is nothing like what I witnessed tonight, the beauty, the majesty of the chamber, the power of the United States, the power of the people in this room."" TRUMP: Really an amazing evening. I don't think there is anything like that anywhere in the world. You can go to any other country, you can go to any other location, any other place. It's the beauty of everything. It's what it represents and how it represents our country. I want to start by introducing some of the people that are here. I know some are going to be left out, but they work so hard. And this is really not a news conference. It's not a speech. It's not anything. It's just -- we're, sort of -- it's a celebration, because we have something that just worked out. I mean, it worked out. We went through hell, unfairly, did nothing wrong -- did nothing wrong. I've done things wrong in my life, I will admit... (LAUGHTER)... not purposely, but I've done things wrong. (LAUGHTER). But this is what the end result is. (APPLAUSE). So, you can take that home. Honey, maybe we'll frame it. (LAUGHTER). It's the only good headline I've ever had in The Washington Post, gotta tell you."" TRUMP: But every paper's the same. Does anybody have those papers? Does anybody have them? Because they're really -- like that. So I appreciate that. But some of the people here have been incredible warriors. They're warriors. And there's nothing, from a legal standpoint; this is a political thing. And every time I'd say, ""This is unfair, let's go to court,"" they say, ""Sir, you can't go to court, this is politics."" And we were treated unbelievably unfairly. And you have to understand, we first went through ""Russia, Russia, Russia."" It was all bullshit. (LAUGHTER). We then went through the Mueller report. And they should have come back one day later. They didn't. They came back two years later, after lives were ruined, after people went bankrupt, after people lost all their money. People came to Washington to help other people -- bright-eyed and bushy tail, I say, they came, one or two or three people in particular, but many people. We had a rough campaign. It was nasty. It was one of the nastiest, they say. They say Andrew Jackson was always the nastiest campaign. They actually said we topped it. It was a nasty... (LAUGHTER). It was a nasty -- both in the primaries and in the -- in the election.  But, you see, we thought, after the election, it would stop. But it didn't stop; it just started. And tremendous corruption -- tremendous corruption. So we had a campaign -- little did we know we were running against some very, very bad and evil people, with fake dossiers, with all of these horrible, dirty cops that took these dossiers and did bad things. They knew all about it. The FISA courts should be ashamed of themselves. It's a very tough thing. And then we ended up winning on ""Russia, Russia, Russia."" It should have taken the one day, as I said, and it took years. And then Bob Mueller testified. That didn't work out so well for the other side. (LAUGHTER). But they should have said that, first week, because it came out -- is that right, Jim Jordan? They knew in the first two days, actually. Devin, is that right? Two days, they knew that we were totally innocent. But they kept it going -- Mark. TRUMP:  They kept it going forever. Because they wanted to inflict political pain on somebody that had just won an election that, to a lot of people, were surprised. I mean, we had polls that said we were going to win. We had Los Angeles Times and a few -- a few papers actually said it was -- we were going to win but it was going to be close. And we did win. It was one of the greatest wins of all time. And they said ""OK, he won."" And, you know, I wrote this down because that was where a thing called the insurance policy -- to me, when I saw the insurance policy -- and that was done long before the election, that was done when they thought that Hillary Clinton was going to win. And by the way, Hillary Clinton and the DNC paid for millions -- millions of dollars, the fake dossier, and now Christopher Steele admits that it's a fake because he got sued by rich people. I should've sued him, too, but when you're president, people don't like suing. TRUMP: I want to thank my legal team, by the way, not for that advice but for... (LAUGHTER) ... other advice. (APPLAUSE). Pat, Jay, Pat, you guys, stand up, please. (APPLAUSE) Great job. Right at the beginning, they said ""Sir, you have nothing to worry about. All of the facts are on your side."" I said, ""You don't understand, that doesn't matter -- that doesn't matter"" and that was really true.    TRUMP: They made up facts. A corrupt politician named Adam Schiff made up my statement to the Ukrainian president. He brought it out of thin air, just made it up. They say, ""He's a screenwriter -- a failed screenwriter. He tried to go in"" -- unfortunately he went into politics after that. (LAUGHTER) Remember, he said the statement, which is a mob statement,""Don't call me, I'll call you."" I didn't say that. Fortunately, for all of us here today and for our country, we had transcripts, we had transcribers -- professional transcribers. Then they said ""Oh, well maybe the transcription is -- is not correct."" But Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and his twin brother -- right -- we had some people that -- really amazing. But we did everything. We said ""What's wrong with it?"" ""Well, they didn't add this word or that one."" Didn't matter. I said ""Add it. They're probably wrong but add it."" So now everyone agrees that they were perfectly accurate. When you read those transcripts -- Tim Scott -- I don't know if Tim's here but he said ""Sir"" -- he's the first one to call me -- ""Sir, I read the transcript. You did nothing wrong."" And Mitch, he stayed there right from the beginning, he never changed. And Mitch McConnell, I want to tell you, you did a fantastic job. (APPLAUSE). Somebody said ""You know, Mitch is quiet."" And I said ""He's not quiet."" (LAUGHTER). ""He's not quiet."" These are the -- he doesn't want people to know him. And they said ""Is Mitch smart?"" I said ""Well, let's put it this way, for many, many years, a lot of very smart, bad in many cases, sometimes good -- but people have been trying to take his place and to the best of my knowledge I've never even heard the subject come up because they've been wiped out so fast."" (LAUGHTER) ""This guy is great."" And I appreciate it, Mitch. And he's also given us 191 now. (APPLAUSE). 191 federal judges, two Supreme Court judges, right? We're up to 191. (APPLAUSE). Great guy. Great guy. He's a tough guy to read. I'm good at reading people, tough guy to read. I'd call him -- I would say ""How'd you do with Mitch?"" ""I don't know."" (LAUGHTER) That's what makes him good, when you can read somebody. Fantastic job. And he understood rightfully this was crooked politics -- this was crooked politics.   TRUMP:  How about all of these people? They're running for office, they're saying the worst things about me, like, eight senators on the Democrat side. Most of them got wiped out. You know, they got their 1 percent or less; most of them got less. They decided to go home. ""Let's go back to California, let's go back to wherever they came from, let's go back to New York."" How about that one? TRUMP: Our New York senator, Gillibrand. ""Let's go back to New York,"" after they get nothing. And then they take an oath that they will be fair, that they will be reason (ph) -- all of the different things. Then they had a sign. They're not fair. But here's the beauty:  So we have four left. They're saying the most horrendous things about me. It's OK. It's politics. And then they're supposed to vote on me! They're trying to replace me, and then they're supposed to be voting. So I think it's -- I mean, I think it's incredible. But -- so Mitch, I want to thank you very much -- incredible. And you have some of your folks here, and they're incredible people, and they've been great from the beginning.  And again, you're out of session, unfortunately. I didn't -- you know, I only told these folks, ""Let's do this today."" We did a prayer breakfast this morning and I thought that was really good. In fact, that was so good, it might wipe this out. But by the end, by the time we finish, this will wipe that one out, those statements. (LAUGHTER). I had -- I had Nancy Pelosi sitting four seats away, and I'm saying things that a lot of people wouldn't have said, but I meant every... (LAUGHTER) I meant every word of it. But we have some of the folks that are going to be leaving right after this, and they work hard, and they did work hard.   TRUMP: Bill Cassidy, senator. Stand up, Bill. What a guy. (APPLAUSE). Great man. When I need to know about health insurance and pre-existing conditions and individual mandates, I call Bill or I call Barrasso. Then we get -- those two guys, they know more than anybody. A man who just became a senator -- he's a little bit like me. We have a couple of them. Very successful guy in business, and he said, ""What the hell? I'll run for the Senate from Indiana."" And he ran, and I saw him on television destroying his opponent in a debate. I said, ""You know, this guy could win,"" and I got behind him. And Mike Braun, you have done some great job. Thank you very much. (APPLAUSE).  Tough! Tough! Thank you. A man who got James Comey to choke, and he was just talking in his regular voice. He's the roughest man. He's actually a -- unbelievable, and I appreciate the letter you sent me today. I just got it. But he's got this voice that scares people. (LAUGHTER).    TRUMP: You know, people from Iowa can be very tough. We're doing very well in Iowa. But I'll tell you, Chuck Grassley, he's looking at Comey -- ""Well, you tell me, what did you say?"" (LAUGHTER) Now, he wasn't being rough. That was just the way he talked. (LAUGHTER) And that was when Comey -- I think that was when Comey announced that he was leaking, lying and everything else, right? He choked because he never heard anybody talk like that. (LAUGHTER). You know, you should have gone -- if -- I wish you got angry. You could have gotten the whole ball game. He would have said, ""I give up!"" Chuck Grassley is an incredible guy. (APPLAUSE). And a man who -- you know, he was running against a tough, smart campaigner. We learned how good she was, right? She was a great campaigner. In fact, by the end of the campaign she was actually -- I thought she was more for me than you were, Josh. I was worried. (LAUGHTER). I saw her ads. She was saying the greatest things about me. And you know who I'm talking about. And I went to a great place, Missouri, and I said, ""Who do you have to beat her?"" And they said, ""Well, we have four people."" I said, ""Let me see them. I've got to interview..."" Can you imagine? I'm interviewing people for the United States Senate. This is what I do. Where have I gone? But I love it. I love it because we're getting great people. The first one I met was Josh Hawley. After about 10 minutes I said to the people, ""Don't show me anybody else. This is the guy."" He was the attorney general; did a phenomenal job in the state, highly respected. And Claire McCaskill -- so, the theory was you couldn't beat her. Great campaigner. Remember the last campaign, she was going be taken -- she was always going to be taken out, then she wins, and people say, ""How did that happen?"" It didn't happen with him.   TRUMP: But she got so friendly toward me -- in fact, one of the ads I still have. I'm putting it in the archives as one of the best ads I've ever made. and she tried to convince people that we were best friends. But Josh ended up winning by five or six points. You were unbelievable, you were tough, and you were something. And one of the greatest supporters on the impeachment hoax was Josh Hawley. He was incensed actually, I watched him, he was incensed at what they were doing and what they were saying. And those were the ones-- you know I had some who said, well I wish you didn't make the call. And that's OK, if they need that. It's incorrect. It's totally incorrect. And then you have some that used religion as a crutch. They never used it before. An article written today, never heard him use it before. But today, you know, it's one of those things. But, you know, it's a failed presidential candidate, so things can happen when you fail so badly running for president. But, Josh Hawley, I want to thank you. You were right from the beginning. Man, did I make a good choice. (APPLAUSE). Thank you, Josh. Tremendous future. A man who is brilliant and who actually was deceived to an extent, comes from a great state, Utah, where my poll numbers have gone through the roof. And one of the senators' poll numbers -- and not this one -- went down big, you saw that. You saw that, Mike? But Mike Lee is a brilliant guy. He's difficult. (LAUGHTER). Whenever I sign bills -- you know, we do sign a lot of legislation that's -- it's big and it's powerful, but it's sort of everybody has to approve it. And I see 99 to one, 99 to one. I say, ""Don't tell me who's the one."" (LAUGHTER) ""Is it Mike?"" ""Yes."" (LAUGHTER) And he always has a good reason for it, too, by the way. But he is, he's incredible. And right at the beginning, he knew we were right, Mike. And I appreciate it very much. It's just fantastic. And say hello to the people of Utah. And tell them, ""I'm sorry about Mitt Romney. I'm sorry."" OK? We can say that Mike Lee is by far the most popular senator from this state. But you've done a fantastic job, Mike, I -- in many ways, in many ways. A young woman who I didn't know at all, but she's been so supportive. And I've had great support from other people in that state. And she's been so supportive and she's been downright nasty and mean about the unfairness to the president. And, Kelly Loeffler, I appreciate very much. Thank you. (APPLAUSE).    TRUMP: She saw it very early on. And we have -- I don't know if we have other senators here, but we've got a hell of a lot of congressmen. I'll go over them quickly, but they have -- they have also been -- you know, it helped when we won 197 to nothing. That's got to be a first, Kevin (ph), right? Is that like a first? The Republicans have this image. See, I say Democrats are lousy politicians because they have lousy policy. Open borders, sanctuary cities, they have horrible policy. Who the hell can win? Oh, their new policy is raise taxes. They want to raise taxes. You know, all my life, I wasn't in politics but I'd say, if you're a politician, you want to say, ""We're going to lower taxes."" They want to raise taxes. So they have open borders, sanctuary cities, raise everybody's taxes, get rid of everybody's health care -- 180 million people in the United States -- and they're really happy. And we're going to give you health care that's going to cost more money than the country could make in 30 years if it really does well. That's one year. So I've always said they're lousy politicians, but they do two things. They're vicious and mean -- vicious, these people are vicious. Adam Schiff is a vicious, horrible person. Nancy Pelosi is a horrible person. And she wanted to impeach a long time ago. When she said, ""I pray for the president, I pray for the"" -- she doesn't pray. She may pray, but she prays for the opposite. (LAUGHTER).    TRUMP: But I doubt she prays at all. And these are vicious people. But they do two things:  They stick together -- historically, I'm not talking now -- they stick together like glue. That's how they impeached, because they had whatever the number is, 220 people. So they don't lose anybody, they'll be able to impeach anybody. You could be George Washington, you could have just won the war and they'd say, ""Let's get him out of office.""   TRUMP:  And they stuck together, and they're vicious as hell. And they'll probably come back for more. But maybe not because the Republican Party's poll numbers, Mitch, have now gone up more than any time, I think, since 2004, 2005. And you know what happened then. But in normal times, decades, you would call it. That was a little unusual time. It was for a very short period. The Republican Party's poll numbers and Donald Trump's poll numbers are the highest I've ever had that.   TRUMP: So maybe they were. (APPLAUSE) It's no way to get your poll numbers up. It's not worth it. Because, from my family's standpoint, it's been very unfair for my family. It's been very unfair to the country. Think of it. A phone call, a very good phone call. I know bad phone calls. This is a phone call where many people -- I think Mike Pompeo was probably on the call. Where's Mike? Mike Pompeo was on the call. Many people were on the call. I know that many people -- they even have apprenti -- bringing up an old favorite word of mine, ""The Apprentice"" -- they have apprenti-- they have people on these calls. And I know there are many -- when I speak to the head of a nation -- and they have many people on. I mean, all of a sudden, do you think they just -- in the case of Ukraine, he's a new president; he seems like a very nice person, by the way. His whole thing was corruption. He's going to stop corruption. We even have a treaty, 2001, 1999. It's a treaty, a signed treaty that we will work together to root out corruption in Ukraine. I probably have a legal obligation, Mr. Attorney, to report corruption. But they don't think it's corrupt when a son that made no money, that got thrown out of the military, that had no money at all, is working for $3 million up front, $83,000 a month. And that's only Ukraine; then goes to China, picks up $1.5 billion; then goes to Romania, I hear, and many other countries. They think that's OK. Because, if it is -- is Ivanka in the audience? Is Ivanka here? Boy, my kids could make a fortune.   TRUMP: They could make a fortune. It's corrupt. But it's not even that; it's just general corruption. And the other thing, as mentioned in the call, and something that I've told Mike Pence, our great vice president -- I would tell him all the time, and I told him when he went on the trip, because he was over there. He never mentioned anything about this, when you had your meeting. It's a terrible thing. But I told Mike -- I said, ""Mike, we're giving them money and, you know, you're always torn about that because we have our country to build; we have our cities to build and our roads to fix. But we are giving the money. Tell me, why isn't Germany paying money? Why isn't France? Why isn't United Kingdom paying money? Why aren't they paying money? Why are we paying the money?"" Is that a correct statement, Mike? I say, ""Find out what the hell is going on."" And I told that to all of my people, OMB. I said -- I asked that question, ""How much is Germany paying? Why isn't Germany paying? Why is the United States always the sucker?""   TRUMP: Because we're a bunch of suckers. But that's turning around fast. But it makes it harder when stuff like this happens. Because you want to focus, and you want to focus perfectly. Think what we could have done if the same energy was put into infrastructure, prescription drug prices. Think of what we could have done. And I'm now talking both sides. Think of what we could have done if we had the same genius -- because it's genius. I will say, it's genius on the other side -- maybe even more so, because they took nothing and brought me to a final vote of impeachment. That's a very ugly word to me. It's a very dark word, very ugly. They took nothing. They took a phone call that was a totally appropriate call -- I call it a perfect call, because it was -- and they brought me to the final stages of impeachment. But now we have that gorgeous word. I never thought a word would sound so good. It's called, ""total acquittal."" (APPLAUSE). ""Total acquittal.""   TRUMP:  So -- so I want to, if I could, real fast, just introduce a few of the people. I have to start with -- I have to start with Kevin. Man, did you do a job. Lucky you're there. Lucky you're there. Because it wouldn't have worked out -- if you don't have the right people. I'll tell you, Kevin McCarthy has done an incredible job. (APPLAUSE). And he loves his job. And he loves his country. I'll tell you what, Mitch and Kevin, they love what they do. Now, Mitch wouldn't even tell you he liked it.   TRUMP: I'd say ""Mitch, do you like it?"" ""I don't know."" It's -- he's the greatest poker player, right? Kevin will say ""I love it,"" right? And I will say that you're going to be Speaker of the House because of this impeachment hoax. I really believe it -- I really believe it and I'm going to work hard on it. (APPLAUSE).    TRUMP: I'm going to try and get out to those Trump -- those Trump areas that we won by a lot. And you know, in '18, we didn't win -- we just won two seats in North Carolina -- two wonderful seats in North Carolina that were not supposed to be won but I went and I made speeches and we had rallies and we did a great job and we won. We took two seats, nobody writes about that. If we lost, it would've been the biggest story of the year. But we're going to go, we're going to do a job and we're going to win a lot of seats -- we're going to win a lot of seats. People are very angry that Nancy Pelosi and all of these guys -- I mean, Nadler, I know him much of my life, he's fought me in New York for 25 years, I always beat him and I had to beat him another time and I'll probably have to beat him again because if they find that I happen to walk across the street and maybe go against a light or something, ""let's impeach him."" (LAUGHTER). So we'll probably have to do it again because these people have gone stone cold crazy. But I've beaten them all my life and I'll beat them again if I have to. But what they're doing is very unfair -- it's very unfair.       (APPLAUSE)  TRUMP: So Kevin McCarthy has been great. So a few names, right? And there'll be a few you forget. If you want, you can raise and I'll say ""great, love to have you, wonderful."" But we're going to do the best we can and I have my Cabinet but the Cabinet is different, I appoint them, OK? I didn't see all of them helping so much. You know, they were running their -- their various bureaucracies, right? No, my Cabinet's great and they're all here but today is the date to celebrate these great warriors, right? These are great warriors, they really fought hard for us. And so I'll start. Kelly Armstrong, North Dakota. Kelly, thank you, great job. (APPLAUSE). Great job. Jim Banks of Indiana. Jim, thank you, Jim. (APPLAUSE). Andy Biggs -- where's Andy? Boy, oh, boy, Andy, he got... (APPLAUSE). There's a guy -- he's tough. I hear we're doing well in Arizona, huh? It's going good, yeah? I think so. I think I saw a poll that was very good for me. (LAUGHTER)   TRUMP: I think we have to make sure -- Martha's going to do -- I think Martha's going to do good but we have some states that are going to be not easy but Arizona's been great and we're stopping illegal aliens from coming in, we're putting up walls. New Mexico, too, a state that's never been in play for Republicans is totally in play, right? Nevada's really looking good. We're -- we're doing well -- we're doing well. We're going to have a great -- there's more spirit -- I will say this, there's more spirit now for the Republican Party by far than the Democrats. You know, Mike Pence just got back from a place -- a beautiful place that Chuck Grassley knows well, Iowa, and he was talking about this fiasco -- the Democrats. They can't count some simple votes and yet they want to take over your health care system. Think of that -- no, think of that. But we also had an election out there and we got 98 percent of the vote. We have two people running, you know, and I guess to consider them non-people but they are running. I mean, one was a governor, one was a Congressman. They're running. We've got 98 percent of the vote.   TRUMP: And everybody from the media was saying ""who are those crowds over there?"" You know, they expect it to be one of these competitive where everybody's running cause they want to win -- they want to win, and it was Trump. Right, Mark Meadows? It was Trump. This was a Trump crowd. And a lot of -- actually, a lot of my guys went there, they went to Iowa and a lot of friends went there and we had tremendous -- they say the spirit -- the spirit for the Republican Party right now is stronger, I think, than it's ever been in the history of our country. I think it's stronger than it's ever been. (APPLAUSE)       TRUMP: And that includes Honest Abe Lincoln. You know, a lot of people forget Abe Lincoln -- I wish he were here, I'd give him one hell of an introduction, right? (LAUGHTER). But he was -- he was a Republican. I -- Abe Lincoln, Honest Abe. Bradley Byrne, Alabama, what a great place. Thank you, Bradley.   TRUMP:  A man who has been a -- an unbelievable friend of mine and spokesman and somebody that -- that I really like. And I know, Kelly, you're going to end up liking him a lot. Something's going to happen that's going to be very good. I don't know. I haven't figured it out yet. But Doug Collins, where is he? Where is Doug? (APPLAUSE). You have been so great. Thank you very much, Doug. Thank you very much. Yeah, thank you. Really amazing job.  A young man who is born with a great gene, because I know his father and how great a politician he was, but he's from Florida, sometimes controversial, but actually, he's not controversial. He's solid as a rock and he's a friend of mine, Matt Gaetz. Matt?    TRUMP: Thank you, Matt. Thank you. Great job. All right. This guy. So he's the NCAA -- meaning a couple of years ago when he was in college -- wrestling champion, NCAA. That's the big deal. That means in all of college you're the champ. You're the best. His record was ridiculous. Nobody would -- nobody could beat him. And I see it. You know, every time, I see it. When I first got to know him, Jim Jordan, when I first got to know Jim I said, ""Huh, he never wears a jacket."" (LAUGHTER)   TRUMP: What the hell's going on?"" He's obviously very proud of his body.(LAUGHTER) And they say where he works out, you know, where the congressmen, senators, they work at. They say, ""When Jim works out, even though he's not as young as he was, but they -- he works out -- the machine starts burning."" You know, it's a different form of a workout than us, right, Sonny? And -- there he is. Look at that guy. (LAUGHTER) But one day I'm looking, and he looks tough, and I'm looking -- and I'm looking at those ears, and I say, ""Those ears have something going on there.""  (LAUGHTER). I said, ""Did you ever wrestle?"" ""Yeah, I did."" But he doesn't talk, but I checked. This guy was a world -- this guy was a champion, top, top wrestler. And when I had the top -- I had all of the teams. And by the way, your Super Bowl champions are coming, I think next week, or soon, very soon, and they -- every one of them want to be here. (LAUGHTER) And the coach loves us. The coach is great, Andy Reid. And every one of them want to be here. We have -- people love it. But we had all of the NCAA championship teams here. They had the golf, the basketball, the -- they had every team here, and one of the teams was wrestling, the wrestling team. Was that Penn State? And Penn State won the title. They have a great team. And I walked up with Jim, and it's like I didn't exist. (LAUGHTER) Those wrestlers, they grabbed him. They love Jim Jordan, and we love you too, because you are some warrior. (APPLAUSE)   TRUMP: A woman who became a -- so we have a couple of women that became stars -- you two. And I always liked the name of her -- you know, I liked the name Lesko. I liked it. That's how I picked it. I liked the name. I saw that face, I saw that everything. They gave me cards. She had, like, seven opponents, right? And you have no idea how much the public appreciates how smart, how sharp you are. This, I can't tell. I can't tell. They just said, ""You know, she's really good. She's really talented."" I said, ""Let's go."" We worked with her. She won her race -- tough race. It's no longer tough because what she does out there is -- is incredible. Arizona loves her. But you were so incredible representing -- I don't say me -- representing our country and getting it out of this impeachment hoax. What you did was incredible.  So Debbie, please stand up. Debbie Lesko. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: A man who I became very friendly with. I don't know why. Do you ever have where -- I'll ask the media -- certain people call, you take their calls; other people call -- if they don't have information, they won't take anybody's call. But other people call, and you don't. This is a guy -- he just -- he's just a very special guy. His wife, I actually like better than him, to be honest. (LAUGHTER) Because he doesn't know that I know that he didn't actually support me right from the beginning, but she did. (LAUGHTER) And on my worst day -- right? On my worst day, my worst -- I won't tell you why it was my worst, but it was not one of those good days. She got on a bus, got many other buses and women all over North Carolina, and they toured North Carolina.   TRUMP:  Well, Mark was back -- sort of semi-supporting another candidate, which he ended up leaving very quickly. I don't think you had a choice because of your wife. But thank her. And Mark Meadows, he's an extraordinary guy. I mean, the only problem is I guess he's announcing. He -- he'd only win by 40 points, but he's announcing that he'll be not running this time. You have somebody good to run? Somebody going to win your district by at least 20 points, please? OK? But he's a tremendously talented man. Not just as a politician, as a human being, he's incredible. And -- and during these horrible times -- I mean, the way he worked, and Jim, and all of you guys. The way they worked was so -- it was like their life was at stake, so many.   TRUMP: Ron DeSantis is another one. He worked so hard. Then he'd call me, he said, Sir, I'd like to run for governor. I said, governor? I don't want you to run, I like you staying... No, I want to run for governor. And I said, well, if you have to. I'd like your support. I said, how can I support you? You're at three. He was at three, he had no money. Somebody else was at 38 and they had $22 million cash, right? I said, look, if it's important, I'll do it. Because he's -- he's been another great warrior. And he's -- by the way, he ran, I endorsed him, his numbers went through the roof. The many who he beat, who was expected to win easily, called me after the race. He said, you endorsed him, and it was like a nuclear bomb went off. There was nothing I could do. He never even spent his money, he saved it. But Ron DeSantis is another one. And now he's the governor of Florida. And, by the way, he's a great governor, he's a very popular governor, his numbers are in the 70s and he's done a great job. But, Mark, I want to thank you very much, fantastic job, thank you very much. Mark Meadows. (APPLAUSE)   TRUMP: And Mike Johnson of Louisiana -- where is Mike? Central casting, what a job. You can represent me any time, you can represent me any time. (APPLAUSE) Thank you. What a job you've done, thank you, Mike. And a man nobody's ever heard of except the other side. He's the other side's worst nightmare. This guy goes down into dungeons and basements, he'll find a document no matter what. He's the most legitimate human being, he's the hardest worker, he's unbelievable. He took tremendous abuse -- I mean, abuse -- the -- the media and you know, the other side and the bad ones, the leakers, the liars, the dirty cops, they wanted to destroy him. They tried, they got close, but he wouldn't let it happen. And honestly, in a certain way, he was the first one. Wouldn't you say, Jim and Mark and every -- this was the first guy, came out of nowhere. He's saying, these people are corrupt. He's still saying it. And he was unbelievable. Devin Nunes, he was unbelievable. (APPLAUSE) Unbelievable. (APPLAUSE)   TRUMP: That's so true, Devin. He'd come in and say -- I didn't even know him. I just heard there were, like -- there was this congressman who kept going into a basement, into files. He knew something was wrong. You felt it, right? And now we know a lot more than we knew then, right? You never thought it was as bad as it is. And hopefully we're going to take care of things because we can never, ever allow this to happen again. (APPLAUSE). Scott Perry of Pennsylvania. Scott, thank you. (APPLAUSE) Thank you, Scott, really great. And you're doing very well over there, by the way. Just saw your numbers. TRUMP: A man who is a -- I mean central casting, if I'm going to pick Perry Mason, I'm going to do a remake of Perry Mason, other than Bill Barr, I'd pick this guy. But I have to say, I'll pick Barr. I'd pick Barr first, right, John Ratcliffe, right? But I have to tell you, if we're doing a remake of Perry Mason, the man I get -- there's nobody in Hollywood like this -- John Ratcliffe, right? Stand up, John. (APPLAUSE)   TRUMP: So -- such a great lawyer, incredible guy, incredible talent, but just a great lawyer. And we appreciate it. He gets on that screen and everyone says, I agree. The other side folds up so fast, we'll probably be using a lot of you in the next year. But you have been fantastic, John, we appreciate it. Thank you very much. A man who's braver than me and braver than all of us in this room, he got -- he got whacked. He got whacked, my Steve, right? I went to the hospital with our great first lady that night.   TRUMP:  Right, honey? And we saw a man that was not going to make it. He was not going to make it. He was -- the doctor -- and I told him his wife -- I said, ""She loves you."" ""Why do you say that?"" Because she was devastated. A lot of wives wouldn't give a damn. (LAUGHTER) A lot of -- a lot of wives -- a lot of wives would have said, ""Uh, yeah."" I said, ""How's he doing?"" ""Oh"" -- she couldn't even talk. She was inconsolable. Most wives would say, ""Not good. Listen, I'm going home now."" But the doctor came in. The wife is like -- she was a total mess. She was really devastated. And it really looked like he had a 20 percent, 25 percent chance -- I think you set a record for blood loss. And Steve Scalise -- I actually -- honestly, I think you're better looking now. You're more handsome now. You -- you weren't that good-looking. You look good now. He looks better now. Can you believe it? I don't know what the hell that is. (APPLAUSE)   TRUMP: Better now. (APPLAUSE) What a guy. And he was practicing... (APPLAUSE) He was practicing for the baseball game against, I guess, the Democrats, right? And this whack job started shooting, hurt Roger -- I don't know if Roger's here -- but hurt a number of people, hit them -- but really hit Steve. Steve was at second base. He was the second baseman. And he went down, and -- and it was terrible. I mean, I saw the whole thing, and it was terrible. Fortunately, you had two brave policeman with you. Because of your high position in Congress, you had two policeman, and they were amazing, the man and the woman. And they came in -- they didn't have rifles. They were against, supposedly, a pretty good sharpshooter with rifles, good equipment, and all they had was a gun. And they started coming in from the outfield, shooting. And they're so far away that a handgun is not preferred. This guy has the rifle, and he's hitting people. And he was going to move up, and there was no out. I mean, if he would have been able to move up, there was no way to get out. The entrance was a single entrance way on the other side where he was. So everyone went into the dugout, ran into the dugout. But Steve was really hit badly in the stomach and -- with a bullet that rips you apart. It was supposed to do that. It rips -- it rips you apart. And these two people came charging forward, boom, boom, boom. And one of them -- you know who? One of them -- him? -- got the shooter, hit him, and then got him, killed him, from a long distance. It was amazing. If you didn't have those two people, you could imagine, right? You could imagine what would have happened. So Melania and I went to the hospital that night, and he was in such bad shape. And he's been working ever since, so hard. But six months ago, they had a baseball game at the Nationals Park, and I'm watching. And it's -- it's on television. And it's just -- you know, a game, people, you want to win it, right? And Steve's at second base. The poor guy can't even walk. Do you remember Bobby Richardson for the New York Yankees? He was known for range, Louis (ph) -- range. He had the greatest range. If a ball's hit to shortstop, Bobby Richardson's the second player -- second baseman. Bobby Richardson would feel the ball. If it's hit to first base, he'll throw it to the first basemen. He had unbelievable range. This was not Steve Scalise.   TRUMP: Steve had no range. (LAUGHTER) One foot, and he has to fall down, right? Because, you know, he was trying to get better. I don't know who the hell put you on the field. (LAUGHTER). And this is a true story. So the game starts, and the first pitch, Steve's standing at second base and the guy is really in bad shape. And I said, ""This is terrible."" A shot, ground ball shot, is hit to second. And Steve -- I say -- I didn't have time to think too much, but I said, ""This is not good. That ball is going toward him."" And this guy stopped that ball, caught the ball. He's now laying down. He throws the ball to first base. He gets them out. I said -- it's the most incredible thing. I've never seen that--.   TRUMP: I've never seen anything like it. (APPLAUSE) Right? And he gets them out, and they then took him out of the game, which was a very wise thing. Because you could never do that again in a million years. But you weren't going to let that ball go through. I don't care if it was hit by the greatest of all time, right? That ball was not going through you, because you are a warrior. Steve, he is fantastic, you are fantastic. You and Liz and Kevin, what a great -- what a group -- I mean, what a group. I got lucky -- I got lucky 'cause you need the people. If I had the wrong people, there'll be a -- maybe a different story, maybe we'd be celebrating something else. But I really want to thank you, Steve Scalise. And Elise, you -- I just read this story, I should -- most incredible, what's going on with you, Elise. TRUMP: So I even said -- you know, I was up campaigning for her, helping her, but I thought ""she looks good, she looks like good talent,"" but did I not realize when she opens that mouth, you were killing them, Elise -- you were killing them.   TRUMP: Elise -- and there's a big story in the New York Post -- I love the New York Post 'cause they treat me well. There aren't too many of you that do but today you're treating me well. I even had a great headline, I -- New York Times, Washington Post. I had all these great headlines. Maybe we should just end it right there. But you had the greatest story yesterday in the Post, that people from all over the country are contributing to her campaign. They were so enthralled with the way you handled yourself, what you said, the way you said it and I'll always be your friend. I think it -- it was -- it's really an amazing story, what a great future you have -- what a great future. Thank you. (APPLAUSE) The First Lady agrees, by the way -- the First Lady agrees. And Michael Turner, you can represent me anytime. Where's Michael, where is he? Well you can represent me. How good were you?   TRUMP: There's another -- there's another Perry Mason type I think, right? What do you think, John (ph)? But Michael, you were fantastic and we appreciate it. Brad Wenstrup -- where's Brad? Brad, great, great job. (APPLAUSE) This is a big day for -- you know, it's only the lawyers stayed -- they -- all the lawyers stayed behind. Lee Zeldin, how good are you -- how good are you? (APPLAUSE) Man. And Lou, your name's not down, they didn't give me your name. Do you know, if -- if -- I didn't announce Louie -- whoever the hell made this list, I -- I got to get rid of them because I -- if I wouldn't have announced Louie, it might've been the end of the presidency. (LAUGHTER) Louie, you have been so great, so tough, and so smart. I got to just -- I got it. But Louie has been amazing, he's a tough guy, he's a smart guy, he's streetwise like crazy. We love Texas and we're with you all the way, Louie -- we're with you all the way. Thank you very much. (APPLAUSE)   TRUMP: So -- so that's the story. We have a great group of warriors and there are others left and I guess probably I'm sure I didn't mention a few and I -- I apologize if that's the case. How's CPAC doing? Good? Huh? My man, stand up please, will you? He's the one -- he said ""you should run."" Right? Matt said -- it's like five years ago, six years ago, and I made a speech and then they do some kind of a straw poll, ""who made the best speech?"" And he said I made the best speech. With all of these professional -- by -- he'd say this -- with all of these professional politicians, they voted by far the best speech was Trump. He calls me, he says ""you should run for politics."" I say ""what do I know about politics?"" But you know what, we learned quickly and our country has never done better than it's doing right now, so it's pretty good.   TRUMP: (APPLAUSE) But thank you, Matt , great, say hello. So -- so that's the story. We've been treated unfairly. Fortunately, we have great men and women that came to our defense. If we didn't, this would have been a horrific incident for our country. When you have Lisa and Peter, the lovers -- the FBI lovers -- ""I want to believe the path you threw out for Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, that's the office. There's no way he gets elected,"" meaning me -- ""there's no way he gets elected."" This is Peter to Lisa, he's probably trying to impress her for obvious reasons.   TRUMP:  ""There's no way he gets elected but I'm afraid we can't take the risk."" Now think of this. In other words, if I get elected, they can't -- they, two lowlifes, they can't take the risk -- they can't take the risk. Think of it. And that's where it came up, the greatest word of all, insurance policy. So he says, ""But I'm afraid we can't take the risk she may lose."" It's like an insurance policy. In the unlikely event you die before you're 40 -- in other words, if I won, they were going to do exactly what they did to us. They were going to try and overthrow the government of the United States, a duly elected president. And if I didn't fire James Comey, we would have never found this stuff. Because when I fired that sleazebag, all hell broke out.   TRUMP: They were ratting on each other, they were running for the hills. Let's see what happens, let's see what happens. it's in the hands of some very talented people, we're going to have to see what happens. But I can tell you, in my opinion, these are the crookedest, most dishonest, dirtiest people I've ever seen. They said -- this is Strzok -- God, Hillary should win, 100 million to one. This is about me. This is an agent from the FBI. Look how they let her off, 33,000 e-mails, deleted. Nothing happens to her, nothing happens. It's unbelievable. But think of that, God, Hillary should win. When these guys are investigating Hillary. Then they go to work for Mueller -- the two of them -- and when Mueller found out that everybody knew that they were a hundred percent this way, he let them go. But they deleted all of their emails and text messages.   TRUMP: So when we got the phone, they were all deleted. Could you imagine the treasure trove? They illegally deleted it. So they left - they left Bob Mueller. He had the look, but he didn't have a lot of other things. Always had the look, Mr. G-man. And I love the FBI and the FBI loves me, 99 percent. It was the top scum. And the FBI people don't like the top scum. So think of that 100 million to one. And he's investigating me. And then, God, Trump is a loathsome human being, isn't he? These are the people looking at me. I'm really not a bad person. And Page said, yes, he's awful. How would you like to have that? This is just -- this is the good stuff. There's stuff a hundred times worse than that. These are all dirty people. And now, I just heard that they're suing the United States of America because they were interfered with. Ah, not going to let it happen, just not going to let it happen. We cannot let this happen to our country.   TRUMP: So I'm going to leave now. And I don't know if any of you have anything to say, you could say it. But this is sort of a day of celebration because we went through hell. And I'm sure that Pelosi and Cryin' Chuck, I've known this guy all the time. The only time I ever saw him cry was when it was appropriate, known him for a long time, Cryin' Chuck. But I'm sure they'll try and cook up other things, they'll go through the state of New York, they'll go through other places. They'll do whatever they can. Because instead of wanting to heal our country and fix our country, all they want to do -- in my opinion, it's almost like they want to destroy our country. We can't let it happen.   TRUMP: Jim Jordan, did you want to say something? Go ahead, huh? Mark?   MEADOWS:  I just -- I want to just say that this reflection today, it's a small reflection of the kind of support you have all across the country. We've got your back. (APPLAUSE)   TRUMP:  Thank you, thank you. This was a highly partisan situation. Pelosi said -- I copied it down exactly -- before the impeachment. She wanted to impeach from day one, by the way, don't let her fool you. You know, she said, no, the impeachment is a very serious thing. I said, she wants to impeach, watch.   TRUMP:  Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there's something so compelling and so overwhelming and bipartisan -- bipartisan, it was 197 to nothing -- and -- other than one failed presidential candidate -- and I call that half a vote, because he actually voted for us on the other one -- but we had one failed presidential candidate, that's the only half a vote we lost. So we had almost 53 to nothing. We had 197 to nothing. And the only one that voted against was a guy that can't stand the fact that he ran one of the worst campaigns in the history of the presidency. But she said there's something so -- ""It has to be so compelling and so overwhelming and bipartisan. I don't think we should go down that path because it divides the country..."" -- she's right about that -- ""...and it's just not worth it."" That was Nancy Pelosi a year ago, right? And I think it's a shame. I think it's a shame.   TRUMP: But as I said, if we can put this genius to work on roads and highways and bridges and all of the things we can do -- prescription drugs. You know, we had -- Secretary Azar is here and I want to thank him for this. But we had, first time in 51 years where drug prices actually came down last year -- first time in 51 years. But what we can do working with both parties in Congress is -- would be unbelievable. It would be unbelievable, all we can do. And I know Chuck Grassley is working very hard on it, and Mitch is working very hard on it. But we can do is -- is incredible. What we can do just generally. We've done so much without it. We've rebuilt our military. We've cut regulations at a level that nobody thought possible. We'll always protect our Second Amendment. We all know that.   TRUMP: But I just want to tell you that it's an honor to be with you all. I want to apologize to my family for having them have to go through a phony, rotten deal by some very evil and sick people. And Ivanka is here, and my -- my sons and my whole family, and that includes Barron. Because I think he's -- Barron, he's up there as a young boy. Stand up, Honey. Ivanka, thank you, Honey. (APPLAUSE)   TRUMP: So I just want to thank my family for sticking through it. This was not part of the deal, and I was going to run for president, and if I won I was going to do a great job. I didn't know that I was going to run, and then when I got in I was going to have to run again, and again, and again. Every week, I had to run again. That wasn't the deal, but they stuck with me, and I'm so glad I did it, because we are making progress and doing things for our great people that everybody said couldn't be done. Our country is thriving. Our country is just respected again, and it's an honor to be with the people in this room. Thank you very much, everybody. (APPLAUSE)   TRUMP: Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. (CHEERS & APPLAUSE - TRUMP POINTS AT A FEW PEOPLE - CLAPS, SHAKES FIST)   (TRUMP & MELANIA EXIT) END"

164,CNN,"The rebuttal put a spotlight on Whitmer, whom the Democratic Party chose to elevate by giving the speech, as well as Michigan itself, a state that Democrats lost to Trump in the 2016 election and that had previously been part of the Democratic Party's so-called ""blue wall."" Michigan will be fought over as a battleground state in the 2020 election. Whitmer was elected governor in 2018 after campaigning on a promise to ""fix the damn roads,"" and her speech served as a way for Democrats to refocus the national political conversation on issues and policies they want to prioritize following the State of the Union and gave the party a chance to draw contrasts with the President. ""All across the country, Democratic leaders are rebuilding bridges, fixing roads, expanding broadband and cleaning up drinking water,"" Whitmer said in her speech, before taking a swipe at the President by saying, ""Bullying people on Twitter doesn't fix bridges -- it burns them. Our energy should be used to solve problems."" Whitmer also addressed the Senate impeachment trial, which is on track to culminate in a final vote on Wednesday. ""As we witness the impeachment process in Washington there are some things each of us, no matter our party, should demand,"" she said. ""The truth matters. Facts matter. And no one should be above the law. It's not what those senators say tomorrow, it's what they do that matters.""  ""Remember: Listen to what people say, but watch what they do,"" she said. ""It's time for action.""  The Michigan governor gave her speech from East Lansing High School in East Lansing, Michigan.  Whitmer wasn't the only Democrat to deliver a response to the President's address.  Democratic Rep. Veronica Escobar of Texas was tapped to deliver the Spanish-language response at a family health center in El Paso, Texas. Escobar similarly kept the focus on health care and the economy. According to a transcript of her speech as prepared for delivery and translated into English, Escobar said, ""Republicans across the nation are actively fighting to dismantle benefits that save lives, working in the courts to eliminate every last protection of the Affordable Care Act, including protections for the 130 million people with pre-existing conditions. Democrats are fighting back."" And she said, ""Democrats also know that too many families are struggling to get by in our economy. President Trump's economic policies have created inequality that is creating two Americas: one where the wealthiest 1% benefit and one that leaves too many farmers, businesses, and working families behind."" Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley also gave a rebuttal of her own on behalf of the progressive Working Families Party. Pressley, who has endorsed Sen. Elizabeth Warren in the Democratic primary, told CNN last week that she considered her speech ""a love letter to the activists and the foot soldiers who have made (progressive) victories possible and who will continue to make victories possible."" Pressley made the case for progressive touchstone policies like ""Medicare for All"" and the Green New Deal, while also directly addressing the President. ""Tonight I want to remind Donald J. Trump that I see right through him,"" Pressley said. ""The American people see right through him. Tonight we reject short sighted policies that work for the wealthy and powerful few but leave the worker and the immigrant behind."" Pressley acknowledged the impeachment trial, but argued that the President presents a threat to the fabric of the country that goes beyond the alleged high crimes and misdemeanors at the center of those proceedings.   ""Since he was sworn into office more than three years ago, Donald Trump and his administration have attacked our communities with racist, xenophobic, hateful rhetoric, and even more bigoted, destructive policy,"" Pressley said. ""For Donald J. Trump, the cruelty is the point."" Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, will be delivering a State of the Union rebuttal of his own from Manchester, New Hampshire, ahead of next week's primary in the state. This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday."

168,CNN,"The most egregious false claim: Obama and trade  Trump, who frequently seems to have his predecessor on his mind for no particular reason, is fond of claiming he has managed to do things President Barack Obama could not -- whether or not Obama actually failed to do these things. At CNN, we start with the facts. Visit CNN's home for Facts First. Last week, touting his trade discussions with the European Union, Trump said at the Davos press conference: ""They haven't wanted to negotiate with past Presidents, but they're going to negotiate with me."" He continued later: ""...Our country wanted to make a deal under President Obama. The EU refused to talk to him."" The European Union didn't only talk to Obama on trade -- it engaged in three years of extensive though unsuccessful negotiations with Obama's administration on a proposed free trade agreement, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. The most revealing false claim: Manufacturing jobs The economy has added 487,000 manufacturing jobs under Trump. Manufacturing job growth slowed significantly in 2019, with a total gain of just 29,000 jobs from January through December, but the President still has a pretty good true story to tell here. Instead, Trump often chooses to spout fiction. He said in a speech to mayors last week: ""We've created 700,000 manufacturing jobs.""  Trump has consistently exaggerated manufacturing job growth -- and as the actual number of jobs created has continued to grow, he has continually increased the inaccurate figure he uses. When the actual number was around 350,000, he said it was ""almost 500,000."" When it was just over 400,000, he said it was ""600,000.""  The most absurd false claim: Trump's lying Trump noted at the Davos press conference that he had opposed the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. He mused, though, that Clinton did ""a lot of bad things"" -- such as ""a lot of lying.""  Fair enough. But then Trump said the following with a straight face: ""Now, with me, there's no lying."" We...beg to differ.  Here's this week's full list of 44 false claims, starting with the ones we haven't previously included in one of these weekly roundups. Impeachment Trump's lying Trump said of his opposition to Clinton's impeachment: ""But in a certain way, I was sticking up for Clinton -- for Bill Clinton...I mean, what he did was nothing good. There was a lot of lying going on. There were a lot of things -- a lot of bad things. Now, with me, there's no lying. There's no nothing."" -- January 22 press conference in Davos, Switzerland   Facts First: Trump's claim that ""with me, there's no lying"" is itself clearly false. He has been so broadly dishonest about Ukraine and impeachment that we were able to compile a list of 65 different false claims he had made on the subject.   John Bolton and the Democrats  ""They didn't want John Bolton and others in the House. They were in too much of a rush. Now they want them all in the Senate. Not supposed to be that way!"" -- January 20 tweet  Facts First: Trump can criticize House Democrats for being in ""too much of a rush"" with their impeachment inquiry to subpoena Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser. But it's not true that ""they didn't want"" Bolton. Democrats asked Bolton on October 30 to testify voluntarily on November 7. He declined to appear -- because Trump's White House directed current and former administration officials not to participate in the inquiry. Democrats decided against issuing a subpoena because they were concerned about the possibility of a lengthy court battle. You can read a full fact check here.  What happened after Trump released the transcript ""When Schiff made up the phony story, and he repeated it to Congress and the world -- and it was a totally phony story -- then I released the transcript...When we released that conversation, all hell broke out with the Democrats, because they say, 'Wait a minute. This is much different than Shifty Schiff told us.'"" -- January 22 press conference in Davos, Switzerland  Facts First: As we have repeatedly noted, Trump released the rough transcript of his July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky before, not after, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff delivered an exaggerated rendition of the call at a committee meeting. When Trump released the transcript, therefore, Democrats did not say it was different than what Schiff had said. A Fox News poll on the impeachment trial ""Majority of people say 'the U.S. Senate already has enough information!' @FoxNews"" -- January 26 tweet  Facts First: The Fox News poll Trump appeared to be referencing found that 48% of people questioned said the Senate already has enough information to make its decision on Trump's articles of impeachment, versus 44% who said the Senate needs to hear more witness testimony.  Forty-eight to 44 is a plurality, not a majority.  Accomplishments Mark Zuckerberg's White House visit ""...and Mark Zuckerberg was in the White House two weeks ago and he said, 'You're number one on Facebook.'"" -- January 22 interview with Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo  Facts First: Zuckerberg, the chairman and chief executive officer of Facebook, has not been to the White House since a dinner with Trump there in October, about three months prior to this Trump claim, Facebook spokesman Dave Arnold told CNN. Arnold declined to comment on what Zuckerberg said to Trump, and Trump wasn't clear what he meant by ""number one.""  Trump has a long history of moving past events closer to the present, intentionally or unintentionally.  The individual mandate and Obamacare ""We've done well with health care anyway. We got rid of the individual mandate. And if you look at that, that was a big thing with Obamacare. That was the end of Obamacare."" -- January 22 interview with Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo Facts First: The individual mandate, which required Americans to obtain health insurance, was indeed a key part of Obamacare -- but it was not ""the end of Obamacare"" when Republicans repealed the mandate in their 2017 tax bill. Key components of Obamacare remain. The bill did not eliminate Obamacare's expansion of the Medicaid insurance program for low-income people, the federal and state marketplaces that allow people to shop for coverage, or the consumer subsidies that help many of them make the purchases. While Trump continued to take other steps to weaken Obamacare, much of it still exists. Obama, the European Union and trade  Trump said he was going to start negotiating a trade deal with the president of the European Commission, then added, ""They haven't wanted to negotiate with past Presidents, but they're going to negotiate with me."" He also said: ""...Our country wanted to make a deal under President Obama. The EU refused to talk to him."" -- January 22 press conference in Davos, Switzerland Facts First: It's not true that the European Union refused to talk to Obama about trade. In fact, the European Union engaged in three years of negotiations with the Obama administration on a possible US-EU free trade agreement, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. The negotiations faltered in 2016.   Michael Bloomberg and Hillary Clinton ""But he (Bloomberg) had a deal with Hillary Clinton that he was going to become Secretary of State. It was very simple. People know that. And it wasn't going to happen. It was going to go to Terry McAuliffe. I mean, so they were playing with Michael."" -- January 22 interview with CNBC's Joe Kernen  Facts First: There is no evidence Clinton had a deal to give the Secretary of State post to either Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor now running for the Democratic presidential nomination, or McAuliffe, the former governor of Virginia.  Trump may have been basing his claim on a hacked 2015 email exchange released by WikiLeaks in 2016. Clinton adviser Neera Tanden asked Bloomberg adviser Howard Wolfson about a media report about some Democrats having approached Bloomberg to run against Clinton in the 2016 election.  As the New York Post reported, Wolfson responded that the idea was ""laughable."" Tanden soon asked what role Bloomberg might want in a Clinton administration, saying, ""Is like Ambassador of China way too small."" Wolfson responded, ""Secty of state Which ain't gonna happen.""   Tanden then forwarded the exchange to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, but the emails do not show any kind of deal. Bloomberg's campaign did not respond this week to a request for comment; Tanden told CNN this week: ""There was absolutely no deal. Period. It was a random email from me to a good friend, who works for him."" Tanden said she has never even heard any discussions about McAuliffe as Secretary of State, ""like ever."" At CNN's request, Chris Bolling, executive director of McAuliffe political action committee Common Good VA, put Trump's claim to McAuliffe, then quickly called back laughing. He said McAuliffe had said, ""I would love to be Secretary of State, but I had no deal to be Secretary of Sate."" The length of drug trials Praising China for cracking down on illegal fentanyl, Trump said China's ""quick trials"" last merely ""one day."" He continued: ""Ours take 15 years; theirs take one day."" -- January 24 speech to mayors  Facts First: Trump might have been intending this as non-literal hyperbole, but nonetheless, US drug trials do not last 15 years. Even the trial of drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman took three months.  China's legal system, of course, affords few rights to accused people, almost all of whom are swiftly convicted. In the US, some cases last longer than others, and appeals can extend the process, but veteran lawyers said Trump was way off. Kenyen Brown, a former US attorney in Alabama who now has a private litigation practice, said Trump's comment was ""hyperbole to the point of being ridiculous."" ""The typical possession with intent to distribute or drug conspiracy federal drug trial concludes after two to three days tops. Of course there are outliers in a few more complicated cases but the President's comment is nonsensical,"" he said in an email. Trump was exaggerating even if he was describing the timeline for an entire case, not just the trial alone. ""President Trump's statement is a gross exaggeration and it is not true,"" said David Haas, a former federal prosecutor in Florida who is now a criminal defense lawyer and has represented people accused of drug trafficking. ""Most federal cases are resolved, either by plea or trial, within months of being filed. That length can vary but it would be unusual for any federal case to be pending longer than 12-18 months.""  Repeats Here are the repeat false claims we have previously fact checked in a weekly roundup: Impeachment The timing of Schiff's comments  ""Remember this: When Schiff made up the phony story, and he repeated it to Congress and the world -- and it was a totally phony story -- then I released the transcript."" And: ""We have people that are corrupt, like Adam Schiff, who misquotes -- I don't mean 'misquotes' -- makes up a statement. He had no idea that I was going to release the transcript. He never thought I'd do that. And for that, I thank the President of Ukraine, because we got their approval. He had no idea I was going to do that."" -- January 22 press conference in Davos, Switzerland ""It was so bad, where he goes before Congress, and he makes a statement that I made, and it was a total fraud. I never made it...That's why I released the conversation, because if I didn't release it, people would have said that I made the statement that he made."" -- January 22 interview with Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo  ""It's a fraud. I watched Schiff prior to this, he wouldn't say it now -- can't -- but he tried to make up a statement that I made. That's why I released the transcript."" -- January 24 interview with Fox News' Raymond Arroyo  Facts First: Trump can reasonably criticize Schiff for Schiff's comments at a House Intelligence Committee hearing in September; as we've written before, Schiff's mix of near-quotes from Trump's phone call with Zelensky, his own analysis, and supposed ""parody"" was at the very least confusing. But Schiff spoke the day after Trump released the rough transcript, not before Trump released the transcript.  Schiff's comments and the law ""Shifty is now exposed for illegally making up my phone call, & more!"" -- January 26 tweet  Facts First: Schiff's words were not illegal. As Trump previously acknowledged, the Constitution includes a specific provision that gives members of Congress immunity from legal jeopardy for comments during official meetings.  Marie Yovanovitch and Trump's portrait ""But I am not a fan of that ambassador, just so you understand. From what I understand, and I heard this a long time ago -- she wouldn't put my picture up."" -- January 24 interview with Fox News' Raymond Arroyo Facts First: There is no evidence that Yovanovitch refused to hang Trump's photo at the US embassy in Ukraine. It took the Trump administration more than nine months after his inauguration to distribute an official photo of Trump to government buildings such as embassies, CNBC reported in 2017. More than seven months into the term, the White House told The Washington Post that Trump had not yet sat for the photo. A State Department official who has recently served in Kiev said the former ambassador never sought to prevent Trump's photo from being put up at the embassy. The official said the photo did not arrive until late 2017. Yovanovitch's legal team did not respond to CNN's request for comment, but NBC received this response from a person ""connected to her legal team"": ""The Embassy in Kyiv hung the official photographs of the president, vice president, and secretary of state as soon as they arrived from Washington, D.C."" The timing of aid to Ukraine  ""Remember this, they got their money and they got it early."" -- January 22 interview with Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo ""So they got the money. In fact they got it very early."" -- January 22 interview with CNBC's Joe Kernen ""Now, here's the other thing: they got their money long before schedule. They got all their money."" -- January 22 press conference in Davos, Switzerland Facts First: The aid to Ukraine did not arrive ""early"" or ""before schedule."" While Trump did lift his freeze on the aid on September 11, more than two weeks before a September 30 legal deadline, the delay caused by Trump's freeze meant that $35 million of the $391 million in aid could not make it out the door in time to meet the deadline, according to impeachment testimony from Mark Sandy, deputy associate director for national security in the Office of Management and Budget. To deal with this problem, Congress had to pass an extension of the deadline. ""Had that provision not been included, then any unobligated funds as of September 30 would have expired,"" Sandy testified. The Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan watchdog agency that works for Congress, concluded that the aid freeze broke a law, the Impoundment Control Act. (The office's report was released the week after Trump made this comment. You can read a full story here.) The whistleblowers disappearing ""There was supposed to be a second whistleblower. What happened to him?...There was supposed to be an informer. What happened to the informer? All of these people disappeared. And when they saw this transcript, they said, 'We got problems.' But they went ahead because they were already there because they -- they had a phony, concocted story made up."" -- January 22 press conference in Davos, Switzerland ""...the second Whistleblower (who vanished after I released the Transcripts)..."" -- January 23 tweet Facts First: There is no evidence that either the second whistleblower or a source for the first whistleblower, whom Trump calls ""the informer,"" have ""disappeared,"" much less that they said ""we got problems"" when Trump released the rough transcript of the July call with Zelensky. The second whistleblower's lawyers had always said that this person -- who was revealed after Trump released the rough transcript -- never planned to file a separate whistleblower complaint, merely to offer corroborating information in private.  ""The whistleblowers have not vanished,"" Bradley Moss, a colleague of Mark Zaid, a lawyer for the two whistleblowers, said on Twitter in October, when Trump made another version of this claim. European aid to Ukraine ""What nobody says -- this is very important to me: Why isn't Germany paying? Why isn't UK paying? Why isn't France paying? Why aren't the European nations paying? Why is it always the sucker -- United States? That's one."" -- January 22 press conference in Davos, Switzerland  ""But I want to make sure, also, in addition to collusion, there's something else I'm always stressing. Why isn't Germany and France and UK and all these other countries in Europe that are much more affected than us -- why aren't they paying something?"" -- January 22 interview with Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo Facts First: European countries, including France and Germany, have provided hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of assistance to Ukraine since Russia's invasion in 2014. Zelensky acknowledged European ""help"" during his meeting with Trump at the United Nations in September, though he said the world's efforts had been inadequate so far: ""And, I'm sorry, but we don't need help; we need support. Real support. And we thank -- thank everybody, thank all of the European countries; they each help us. But we also want to have more -- more."" You can read a full fact check here. People talking about Trump's calls with Ukraine's President ""And I watched -- they don't talk about my conversation. They don't talk about my transcripts."" And: ""When we have the head of the World Trade Organization here, and he has to listen to this nonsense about a call that was perfect, that nobody talks about. I never see them talking about the transcription. I never see them talking about the call, because there's nothing to say."" -- January 22 press conference in Davos, Switzerland ""I had a first call which was perfect, and I had a second call which was perfect. You notice they don't mention the calls, though. They never mention the calls. They talk about everything but the calls."" -- January 22 interview with CNBC's Joe Kernen  Facts First: To the contrary, Trump's call with Ukraine's President was the subject of widespread discussion among members of Congress and in the media at the time; it was a central focus of Democrats' impeachment push. Rep. Al Green's comments ""As Congressman Green said -- Al Green. He's a beauty. As Congressman Green said, 'We got to beat him by impeachment because we can't beat him in the election.'"" -- January 22 press conference in Davos, Switzerland Facts First: Trump was at least slightly exaggerating Green's comments. In May, Green said this: ""I'm concerned that if we don't impeach this President, he will get reelected."" In September, when Trump previously claimed Green had said ""we can't"" beat Trump without impeachment, Green told CNN, ""I never said we can't beat the President."" Obama's aid to Ukraine ""President Obama gave them nothing. He gave them pillows and sheets and things like that, and I gave them tank busters."" -- January 22 interview with CNBC's Joe Kernen Facts First: Obama did refuse to provide lethal aid to Ukraine, but he didn't send mere pillows and sheets; he sent counter-mortar radars, drones, armored Humvees and night vision devices, among other things. You can read a full fact check here. What Ukrainian leaders said ""There was one call, which was perfect, and then there was a second call -- I guess, a couple of months later -- which was perfect. The President of Ukraine said it was perfect. The Foreign Minister of Ukraine said it was perfect. So if we have a transcription, we have the call, and we have the person on the other side of the call saying it was good."" -- January 22 press conference in Davos, Switzerland Facts First: Ukraine's President and foreign minister have made comments that bolster Trump's argument that he did not pressure Ukraine to investigate his opponents in order to receive US military aid -- but the President and foreign minister have never called the phone call ""perfect.""  The foreign minister, Vadym Prystaiko, has said, ""I have never seen a direct relationship between investigations and security assistance,"" according to Reuters, citing Russian news service Interfax. And Prystaiko has said Trump's July phone call with Zelensky was ""friendly"" and that ""I think there was no pressure."" Zelensky did say there had been ""no pressure"" from Trump and made other statements to that effect, but he has not gone so far as to say Trump did nothing wrong. In an interview published by Time magazine in early December, Zelensky did say, ""Look, I never talked to the President from the position of a quid pro quo. That's not my thing."" But Zelensky continued: ""I don't want us to look like beggars. But you have to understand. We're at war. If you're our strategic partner, then you can't go blocking anything for us. I think that's just about fairness. It's not about a quid pro quo. It just goes without saying."" The accuracy of the whistleblower In a January 23 tweet, Trump referred to the whistleblower who complained about his dealings with Ukraine as ""the fake whistleblower."" Facts First: The whistleblower's allegations have been proven highly accurate. In fact, the rough transcript released by Trump himself showed that the whistleblower's primary allegations about his call with Zelensky were correct. You can read a full fact check here. Immigration Mexican soldiers and the border ""Mexico has been terrific. Mexico has given us 27,000 soldiers at our southern border. "" -- January 24 speech to mayors Facts First: Mexico has deployed around 27,000 troops, but Trump exaggerated how many are being stationed near the US border in particular. CNN reported on November 2: ""Nearly 15,000 troops are deployed to Mexico's northern border, where they've set up 20 checkpoints, Mexican Defense Minister Luis Cresencio Sandoval said last week at a press briefing on the country's security strategy. At the southern border, 12,000 troops are deployed and have set up 21 checkpoints."" Acting US Customs and Border Protection commissioner Mark Morgan has offered similar numbers, telling reporters in September that 10,000 of approximately 25,000 troops were on Mexico's southern border. Economy and trade Manufacturing jobs ""I've created almost 700,000 manufacturing jobs."" -- January 22 interview with CNBC's Joe Kernen January 22 interview with CNBC's Joe Kernen ""And we've created 700,000 manufacturing jobs..."" -- January 24 speech to mayors Facts First: Trump was exaggerating. The economy added 487,000 manufacturing jobs between January 2017, when Trump took office, and December 2019, official data shows. The number is 514,000 jobs added if you go back to November 2016, the month of Trump's election, as Trump often likes to do. What Obama said about manufacturing jobs ""I've created almost 700,000 manufacturing jobs. The past administration said manufacturing is dead, which I said, 'Tell me about that. How do you -- you can't do that.'"" -- January 22 interview with CNBC's Joe Kernen ""A lot of that goes to farmers and manufacturers. And we've created 700,000 manufacturing jobs, which we were told by past administrations -- but one, in particular -- that you would never have manufacturing jobs. I would say, you have to be -- I mean, how can you not have manufacturing jobs? So we're at 700,000 manufacturing jobs."" -- January 24 speech to mayors Facts First: Trump's comments appeared to refer to a remark Obama made at a PBS town hall in 2016 -- but he was inaccurately describing what Obama said.  Obama scoffed at Trump's promises to bring back what Obama called ""jobs of the past"" without providing specifics on how he would do so. Contrary to Trump's claims, though, Obama didn't say manufacturing was dead or that new manufacturing jobs could not be created; Obama boasted of how many manufacturing jobs were being created during his presidency, saying, ""We actually make more stuff, have a bigger manufacturing base today than we've had in most of our history."" Why the European Union was formed ""But we find, I find, that the European Union is tougher to deal with than anybody. They've taken advantage of our country for many, many years. It was actually formed for the purpose of taking advantage of the United States, if you really think about it."" -- January 22 interview with Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo Facts First: Experts on the European Union say it was not formed to take advantage of the United States. ""The President's claims are preposterous. The European Communities (forerunner of the EU) were formed in the 1950s as part of a joint US-Western European plan to stabilize and secure Western Europe and promote prosperity, by means of trade liberalization and economic growth, throughout the shared transatlantic space,"" Desmond Dinan, a public policy professor at George Mason University who is an expert in the history of European integration, said in response to a previous version of this claim. US presidents have consistently supported European integration efforts. ""The EU was launched in 1993, on the shoulders of the European Communities, to promote peace and prosperity in the post-Cold War era, an era also of rapid globalization. American officials may have had their doubts about the feasibility of monetary union, and about the possibility of a Common (European) Security and Defense Policy, but the US Administration strongly supported further European integration in the 1990s,"" Dinan said. The trade deficit with the European Union Trump claimed three times that the US has long had a trade deficit with the European Union of $150 billion per year, or ""more."" Facts First: The trade deficit with the European Union was $114.6 billion in 2018, $101.2 billion in 2017, $92.5 billion in 2016. The deficit was $169.6 billion in 2018 if you only count trade in goods and ignore trade in services. But Trump, as usual, failed to specify that he was using this more limited measure. We'll ignore Trump's characterization of trade deficits as losses, which is sharply disputed by many economists. Median household income Trump claimed twice that median household income has increased by about $10,000 during his presidency. (He once said ""over $10,000 a family,"" once said ""almost a $10,000 increase."") Facts First: It's not true that household income gains under Trump have already hit $10,000 in less than three years. A firm called Sentier Research found pre-tax income gains of about $5,500 between January 2017 and October 2019. You can read a longer fact check here. China's economic performance  ""You know, they're having the worst year that they've had in 67 years, right?"" -- January 22 interview with Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo    Facts First: China's second-quarter GDP growth of 6.2% and third-quarter and fourth-quarter GDP growth of 6% each were its worst since 1992, 27 years ago. Trump has repeatedly made clear that he knows that 27 years is the reported figure, but he has added additional years for no apparent reason. China's agricultural spending  ""The fact is: We love our farmers, but they were doing -- the maximum they ever did was $16 billion in one year to China."" -- January 24 speech to mayors   Facts First: China spent $25.9 billion on American agricultural products in 2012, according to figures from the Department of Agriculture. Highway approval time Trump claimed that highways used to take ""21 years to get approved,"" but ""we have that down to two years now. And we think we'll have it down to one year."" -- January 24 speech to mayors Facts First: There is no apparent basis for Trump's claim that it now takes just two years to get environmental approvals for highways. According to the Federal Highway Administration's National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) page, the department's median environmental impact statement completion time was 47 months in 2018, up from 46 months in 2017 and 44 months in 2016.   At a Trump event earlier in January, Council on Environmental Quality chairwoman Mary Neumayr said, ""The Council on Environmental Quality has found that the average time for federal agencies to complete Environmental Impact Statements is four and half years. Further, for highway projects, it takes over seven years on average.""  Brad Karkkainen, a University of Minnesota law professor and expert on environmental and land use law, said in an email that he has ""never heard of a highway project taking 18 or 20 years, though it's certainly possible that when the median time was six or seven years, a few projects took twice as long, perhaps more."" He said some projects can ""sail through"" much faster than the median time, ""but to suggest as Trump does that the typical time has gone from 17+ years to two years is just nonsense."" The Electoral College margin in 2016 Trump claimed that his Electoral College margin of victory in 2016 was ""306 to 223."" -- January 22 interview with Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo    Facts First: Hillary Clinton earned 232 votes in the Electoral College, not 223. This was not a one-time slip; Trump has habitually said ""223."" Air quality ""We want to have the cleanest water on Earth. We want to have the cleanest air on Earth. Our numbers, as you saw -- we had record numbers come out very recently. Our numbers are very, very good -- our environmental numbers. Our water numbers, our -- our numbers on air are tremendous...But we are doing better right now than we've ever done, in terms of cleanliness, in terms of numbers."" -- January 22 press conference in Davos, Switzerland Facts First: By several measures, US air was cleaner under Obama than it has been under Trump. Three of the six types of pollutants identified by the Clean Air Act as toxic to human health were more prevalent in the air as of 2018 than they were before Trump took office, according to Environmental Protection Agency data. Additionally, there were more ""unhealthy air days"" for sensitive groups in 2018 than in 2016 -- 799 days across the 35 American cities surveyed by the EPA, up from 702. Though there were significantly more ""unhealthy air days"" in Obama's first term than there have been in Trump's, the lowest amount of unhealthy air days -- 598 -- occurred in 2014 under Obama. Military spending by NATO members ""Well, you look at what I did with NATO, $530 billion more. Not total. More."" -- January 22 interview with Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo Facts First: Trump's math was wrong. Stoltenberg explained during a meeting with Trump on December 3 that non-US NATO members have added a total of $130 billion to their defense budgets since 2016. By 2024, Stoltenberg said, ""This number will increase to $400 billion."" The $130 billion current increase cannot be added to the $400 billion increase expected by 2024; the $400 billion is a cumulative figure that includes the $130 billion. Judicial confirmations ""191 Federal Judges (a record)..."" -- January 26 tweet  Facts First: Trump had not set a record for total judges appointed as of this point in a first presidential term. According to data from Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks judicial appointments, Trump had appointed 187 judges as of the day after this tweet -- two Supreme Court justices, 50 appeals court judges and 135 district court judges. Wheeler said it's possible to get to a total of 191 judges by adding Trump's three appointments to the Court of Federal Claims and his designation of a sitting judge on that court as chief judge -- though he noted that claims court judges are ""generally not included in such counts.""  Regardless, Trump did not hold the record at the time: President Jimmy Carter had appointed 197 judges as of the same date in his presidency, Wheeler said. And as a percentage of the federal judiciary, Trump's 187 appointments represented 21% of all judgeships -- lower than the percentage for President Richard Nixon (32%), Carter (29%) and Clinton (22%).  Trump did have the record for the total number of appeals court judges appointed, Wheeler said. "

170,CNN,"In the process, it became clear how political partisanship and patronage play a big role in preventing resources from reaching communities that are desperately in need.     Along with other Minnesota legislators, I wrote to Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao in support of the project. But the state was shut out of the program and the grant application was ultimately denied.    Indeed, while the Trump administration awarded $900 million in BUILD grants in the 2019 fiscal year, Minnesota didn't receive a single dime of funding.    The city of Paducah, Kentucky, on the other hand, was awarded $10.4 million for riverfront improvements, including an ""excursion pier."" Perhaps the Department of Transportation made a legitimate judgment that this was a matter of greater importance than Minnesota's -- after all, I'm sure the Paducah tourism industry is glad that riverboats will be able to dock there overnight.     But perhaps there's something else going on here. Related: The mounting infrastructure crisis Washington isn't fixing fast enough Politico reports that, ""In her first 14 months as Transportation secretary, Secretary Chao met with officials from Kentucky, which her husband, Mitch McConnell, represents in the Senate, vastly more often than those from any other state."" Indeed, one out of every four meetings she took with local officials from any state between January 2017 and March 2018 was with her husband's constituents. I work very hard to deliver for Minnesota, but I draw the line at marrying the Secretary of Transportation.   Meanwhile, American Public Media reports that, in the lead-up to the 2018 midterm elections, Secretary Chao ""traveled to a vulnerable incumbent's state at least three times"" to trumpet the awarding of BUILD funding. Each of these incumbents was a Republican.  It's happening again in 2019. Quick, what do these states have in common: Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, and North Carolina? Each one is represented by a Republican Senator facing a competitive race in 2020.  And, lo and behold, each one received multiple BUILD grants in this round of funding. In all, more than one-quarter of BUILD funding -- a total of more than $239 million -- was funneled to these six states alone.   The use of taxpayer funding to -- as Cornell University professor Douglas Kriner put it to APM -- ""[r]eward your allies and punish your enemies"" isn't new. For example, before I came to the Senate, Republicans were accusing the Obama administration of doing the same thing.   But that doesn't make it right. No matter which party they belong to, Americans want and expect government leaders to act in the best interests of the American people, not in those leaders' own selfish partisan interests.    That's why over the last century and half, crucial reforms were enacted to prevent that kind of behavior. The Pendleton Act of 1883 ended the so-called ""spoils system"" where government positions were routinely awarded based on partisan loyalty instead of merit. The Hatch Act of 1939 prohibited executive branch employees from using their taxpayer-funded office to engage in partisan politics. And when Richard Nixon used the office of the presidency for personal political gain-- attempting to use the CIA to shut down the Watergate investigation -- it led to formal impeachment hearings before he resigned.   And, of course, that's why the House moved to impeach Donald Trump for attempting to use the power of his office to pressure  the president of Ukraine to launch investigations that would benefit him politically.   Minnesotans know it's wrong for a President of any party to put his own personal interests ahead of the public good. And now my constituents have reason to be concerned that the Trump administration's desire to return to the ""spoils system"" may be directly and unfairly affecting their economic security.   It's not just transportation. Agriculture Committee Ranking Member Debbie Stabenow recently released a report highlighting disconcerting irregularities in the Trump administration's distribution of taxpayer-funded farm aid.    The need for this assistance was created by the Trump administration's own erratic trade policies. And now, the administration's solution to this self-inflicted crisis appears to be designed to pick winners and losers. ""Payment rates,"" the report finds, ""have not been distributed equitably between regions, counties, and even next-door neighbors, and have failed to benefit the farmers who have been hit the hardest.""   The report details several concerning trends. ""Despite small, medium, and beginning farms being more vulnerable during tumultuous times, USDA has done nothing to target assistance to these farmers,"" the report reads. Meanwhile, according to an AP article mentioned in the report, the family-owned farms of the billionaire Republican governor of West Virginia received the maximum payment under the administration's assistance program.   But while there are many questionable examples, one broad trend sticks out: A vastly disproportionate share of the funding is going to red states. Of the dozens of states receiving funding, the five states receiving the highest per-acre payment rates were all in the South, with the highest being Georgia. ""Farmers in Georgia,"" the report finds, ""have already received over $50 per acre ... while farmers in 34 other states received $25 or less, including 14 states that received $10 or less.""   This makes no sense.  The collateral damage from the Trump administration's trade policy is largely concentrated in the North, Midwest, and West -- for example, as the Washington Post reported, the Trump trade wars have helped to nearly wipe out the dairy industry in Minnesota's Le Sueur County.    And yet, 95% of the counties selected to receive the top payment rate are in the South. I struggle to understand why an average-sized farm in Hancock County, Georgia, should be receiving $66,450 in payments under this program while a similar-sized farm in Sherman County, Oregon, is receiving less than $9,000. Perhaps it's a coincidence that Georgia is widely seen as a swing state in the 2020 presidential election, and that Georgia's two Republican senators will both be facing re-election next year. But three years into its spree of disregarding norms, precedents, and even laws governing the misuse of official power for political ends, the Trump administration has not earned the benefit of the doubt.   Even in the best-case scenario, this is a careless use of taxpayer dollars on a scale that dwarfs any scandal in recent memory. Most of us know the name Solyndra by heart, because Republicans spent months investigating the Obama administration's failed $535 million loan guarantee for the energy company that went bankrupt. When it comes to the aid package for farmers, however, we are talking about $25 billion in taxpayer money -- a sum that is more than 46 times bigger.   That's why I'm asking the Trump administration to produce documents and make officials involved with decisions regarding the allotment of transportation and agriculture funding available for questioning. Perhaps the administration and its Republican defenders truly believe that massive factory farms in the South are more deserving of taxpayer assistance than small family farms in Minnesota. After all, when questioned about the future of the dairy industry, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said, ""In America, the big get bigger and the small go out.""      But perhaps these irregularities in funding are an extension of what we're learning about the Trump administration's approach to foreign policy -- that this President and his Republican enablers believe the power of the presidency exists to reward the loyal, not the deserving. Congressional oversight needs to be expanded accordingly, because if this President is allowed to get away with this abuse of taxpayer dollars, it will set a precedent for future leaders of this country.   Minnesotans in Moorhead dealing with that dangerous rail crossing, small farmers waiting in vain for promised assistance in the wake of the Trump trade disaster, and all Americans concerned with the integrity of their government need answers. We know what happened on that phone call with the Ukrainian President because a whistleblower bravely lodged concerns, journalists reported on the complaint, the White House released the transcript, and the House used its oversight powers to get to the truth. Now it's time for the House to do the same with these funding discrepancies and get the facts.     I know that the Trump administration has demonstrated no appetite for cooperating with legitimate congressional oversight -- but they should know that I fully intend to use every mechanism at my disposal to get the answers Minnesotans deserve anyway.  The Trump administration may see no problem with shortchanging Minnesotans to reward its political allies, but I refuse to let that happen on my watch."
171,CNN,"Since Roberts and the 100 senators took their oaths for the trial, he has sat, wearing his customary black robe, at a large desk above the rows of senators' desks. As he has listened to the legal teams at the lectern make their cases, Roberts has leaned back, hands folded, occasionally putting a finger up to his temple. In front of him are a binder, loose sheets of paper and the little nub of a gavel he raps when it is time to declare a break. That silent posture represents a departure from his position at the Supreme Court, where, as he listens to a lawyer at the lectern, he regularly interjects with questions. But there, as distinct from his Senate role, he has a crucial vote and decides cases. RELATED: Why John Roberts admonished the impeachment legal teams at 1 a.m. Senate Republican and Democratic leaders will organize the questions to be asked from their members. The standard question form includes lines for the senator's name and to whom the question should be directed (House managers or President's counsel). Groups of senators may band together, as happened in 1999. In one instance, Rehnquist announced: ""This is a question from Sens. (Mike) DeWine, (Susan) Collins and (Frank) Murkowski to the House managers. With all of the conflicting testimony that exists on the record between Monica Lewinsky and Betty Currie, for example, how are we to resolve the questions of perjury and obstruction of justice without observing the demeanor of witnesses?"" Lewinsky was the former White House intern with whom Clinton had had a sexual liaison; Currie was his personal secretary. US Rep. Asa Hutchinson, one of the trial managers, responded at length about the importance of hearing directly from witnesses, beginning with, ""I don't think there is any way to resolve the conflicts in their testimony without calling the witnesses."" Whatever thoughts Rehnquist had, he kept to himself. But, as Roberts observed on Tuesday, Rehnquist, who died in 2005 and was his immediate predecessor as chief justice, had sought succinct questions and answers. Rehnquist told lawyers on both sides that he would ""operate on a rebuttable presumption that each question can be fully and fairly answered in five minutes or less."" Roberts noted that the 1999 transcript showed that the statement was met with ""laughter."" ""Nonetheless,"" Roberts concluded on Tuesday, ""managers and counsel generally limited their responses accordingly. I think the late chief's time limit was a good one and would ask both sides to abide by it."" Then, it gets really thorny When the two-day round of questions is finished, the senators -- and perhaps Roberts -- will confront more difficult issues related to witnesses. Senators have not resolved whether to call witnesses who may have knowledge of Trump's dealings with Ukraine, such as former national security adviser John Bolton. That dilemma has only become more fraught as The New York Times revealed this week that Bolton, according to the newspaper's sources, has recounted in a draft book manuscript that Trump told him he wanted to withhold military aid to Ukraine until the country investigated former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democratic rival of Trump.  Based on Senate trial precedent, as well as Roberts' cautious and reserved approach, he is unlikely to take any determinative role in disputes over witnesses or any matter that would seriously influence Trump's ultimate fate -- or jeopardize his own reputation as a jurist and chief justice of the United States. But Roberts could face entreaties to enlarge his role. Some senators and House managers, as well as political commentators, have been debating outside the chamber the extent of Roberts' duties and whether he might even break a tie if senators split 50-50 on witnesses. RELATED: Chief Justice John Roberts says Americans may 'take democracy for granted' The Senate rules give the chief justice specific duties as a presiding officer, adhering to the Constitution's dictate that the ""sole power"" to try a president rests with the Senate. In 1999, Rehnquist saw his role as limited, famously taking a page from Gilbert and Sullivan's ""Iolanthe"" and remarking that he ""did nothing in particular, and did it very well."" In the only other presidential impeachment trial, that of President Andrew Johnson in 1868, Chief Justice Salmon Chase broke tie votes twice, but those moves and his political stance throughout that trial remain controversial today. The voting power of the presiding officer has not been tested in modern times. But many scholars of impeachment believe Roberts would not be able to break a tie, and a recent Congressional Research Service report observed, ""The Chief Justice, when presiding over an impeachment trial, would not be expected to vote, even in the case of a tie. If a vote on a question results in a tie, the question is decided in the negative."" When the vice president presides over the Senate, he is able to break a tie vote. That power is delineated in the Constitution."

173,CNN,"The trial court, the attorneys said, was in a ""rush to move the case along"" and prevented the jurors from hearing evidence surrounding Roof's competency hearings in which five experts found him to be ""delusional.""  ""Roof's crime was tragic, but this Court can have no confidence in the jury's verdict,"" the attorneys wrote. Roof sentenced to death in January 2017 Roof, an avowed white supremacist, was convicted of federal murder and hate crimes charges, and he was sentenced to death in January 2017. He represented himself at the penalty phase of the trial, telling jurors that ""there's nothing wrong with me psychologically"" and to disregard his attorneys' previous arguments during the trial. ""Anything you heard from my lawyers in the last phase, I ask you to forget it,"" he said. Prosecutors presented evidence in court of chilling writings from a jailhouse journal he wrote after the attack. ""I would like to make it crystal clear. I do not regret what I did,"" Roof wrote in the journal. ""I am not sorry. I have not shed a tear for the innocent people I killed."" Roof's mental state was explored in detail in documents from Roof's competency hearings and videos of three prison visits by his family that were released in May 2017. According to one transcript, Roof told a psychologist working for his defense team that his death penalty wouldn't be carried out because he'd ""be rescued by white nationalists after they took over the government."" After his conviction on federal charges, Roof pleaded guilty in April 2017 to state murder and attempted murder charges in the killings. He was sentenced to nine consecutive life sentences and three consecutive 30-year sentences for those counts. The federal government has not executed a convict since 2003. Attorney General Bill Barr directed the Bureau of Prisons to reinstate the federal death penalty last July, but the Supreme Court agreed to put that plan on hold in December."

176,CNN,"But Sen. Jeff Merkley told CNN's Dana Bash Tuesday that Dershowitz's theory would in effect hand presidents the ability to interfere in elections and escape consequences. ""I really thought Dershowitz disgraced himself,"" the Oregon Democrat said. ""Because he said essentially even if a President commands the power of state to corrupt a future election, by seeking the intervention of a foreign power, that that's not something that impeachment would be appropriate for. It's exactly the type of foreign interference that the founders talked about."" Trump has repeatedly made unfounded and false claims to allege that the Bidens acted improperly in Ukraine. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe Biden or his son Hunter Biden, who was on the board of a Ukrainian energy firm. The Times report on Bolton complicated life for a handful of Republicans who are under pressure from Democrats to vote for fresh witnesses who did not testify to the House investigation following Trump's vow to avoid cooperating with the impeachment push. ""The reporting on John Bolton strengthens the case for witnesses and has prompted a number of conversations among my colleagues,"" Maine's Sen. Susan Collins said. Utah's Sen. Mitt Romney added: ""I think with the story that came out yesterday that it is increasingly apparent that it would be important to hear from John Bolton."" But despite the new focus on Bolton, there is no sign yet that four Republican votes will be forthcoming to piece together a 51-vote majority that would be needed to call new witnesses. Several Republicans seemed pleased by Dershowitz's presentation, according to CNN reporters in the chamber on Monday night. Tuesday will showcase brief closing arguments from Jay Sekulow and Pat Cipollone and will take around two hours, according to a person familiar with what we should expect.  Impeachment defense leaves Republican senators little choice The President and his most fervent fans must have been delighted as they heard arguments that had been rehearsed for months on Fox News opinion shows echo across the Senate floor. Any vote later this week to depose Bolton or other witnesses could prolong the trial and frustrate Trump's hopes for an acquittal by the time of the State of the Union address next week. It could also expose the minimum of four GOP senators who would be needed to advance such a step to the President's certain wrath. But most of Trump's lawyers essentially offered Republican senators no choice but to buy the President's case entirely -- despite its many glaring factual deficiencies. For red state senators or those who have concluded their fates lie in sticking closely to Trump, it's an easy political choice. ""The White House counsel has absolutely shredded, shredded, the case brought forward,"" said Iowa's Sen. Joni Ernst during a dinner break. Texas' GOP Sen. Ted Cruz added: ""I get that the press loves to obsess over the latest bombshell."" But, he added, ""the legal issue before this Senate is whether a President has the authority to investigate corruption."" The legal approach pursued by Trump's team leaves moderates such as Collins and Colorado's Sen. Cory Gardner exposed to Democratic claims that they will block a fair trial if they don't vote to hear witnesses such as Bolton. Trump is being tried in the Senate over two articles of impeachment, alleging abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, in connection with his pressure on Ukraine for an investigation into political opponents including Biden. In the evening session, Trump lawyer Robert Ray offered a strongly argued case warning about the gravity of removing a President between elections, saying it would not be in the best interests of the country. ""We have witnessed the endless procession of legal theories to sustain this partisan impeachment, from treason to quid pro quo to bribery to extortion to obstruction of justice to soliciting an illegal foreign campaign contribution to a violation of the Impoundment Control Act to who knows what all is next,"" Ray told senators. Defense turns into a searing political play But for much of the day, other members of Trump's team, such as former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, offered far more political advocacy. ""We would prefer not to be talking about this,"" Bondi said, before launching into a fearsome attack on Biden -- an ironic moment, since Trump was the one who had brought up unproven claims about his rival that caused the political drama that has held Washington in thrall for months. Trump's team even rolled out Bill Clinton nemesis Ken Starr to explode Democratic heads by bemoaning the political damage of an ""age of impeachment"" -- 20 years after the then-independent counsel had pushed for the 42nd President's ouster. Ernst seemed to let slip the partisan goal of the defense argument in a conversation with reporters. ""Iowa caucuses are next Monday evening. I am really interested to see how this discussion today informs and influences the Iowa caucus voters, those Democratic caucus voters, will they be supporting Vice President Biden at this point?"" she said. Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Biden's presidential campaign, hit back at Bondi. ""We didn't realize that Breitbart was expanding into Ted Talk knockoffs. Here on planet Earth, the conspiracy theory that Bondi repeated has been conclusively refuted,"" Bates said. ""Joe Biden was instrumental to a bipartisan and international anti-corruption victory. It's no surprise that such a thing is anathema to President Trump."" The President's team argued that he had been right to withhold aid to Ukraine because he feared corruption -- and put Biden and his son Hunter, who was on the board of a Ukrainian energy giant while his father oversaw policy toward Kiev, at the center of the storm. There is little evidence in the rough transcript of a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that Trump was interested in the wider issue of corruption. But he does repeatedly press for probes into Biden. There are appropriate questions about whether Hunter Biden presented an unacceptable conflict of interest with his employment choices. But despite Trump's false claims, in fact, Joe Biden's pressure for Ukraine to fire a prosecutor seen in Washington and Europe as corrupt would have made it more likely that Burisma, the company for which Hunter Biden was working, would be investigated. Still, the President's legal team has the luxury of knowing that its efforts are almost certain to be rewarded given the reality that not enough Republicans will vote to convict their own party's President. That gives them all sorts of leeway to please their boss -- and to advance his political goals."
177,CNN,"So, what was a loyal legal team, who may or may not have known about the content of the book before their opening argument, supposed to do? Jay Sekulow brushed it off as irrelevant -- arguing, ""We deal with transcript evidence ... We do not deal with speculation, allegations that are not based on evidentiary standards at all."" He did, however, show a video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi handing out pens during the signing of the impeachment documents -- as if that was somehow an action that should rise to the level of outrage of the President of the United States. Ken Starr, yes that Ken Starr -- the prosecutor whose report on Bill Clinton led to the President's impeachment -- had the chutzpah to take the moral high road decrying the overuse of impeachment, arguing the process ""is filled with acrimony and divides the country like nothing else."" Lovely, if not bizarre, given the lack of self-reflection it required for him to deliver that message. Still, his argument included no real defense of the President or his actions. Pam Bondi was clearly tasked with making the case for why Hunter Biden's role on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company, is more troubling than the President of the United States attempting to force a foreign power to bend to his personal will. Never mind that the theory that Hunter Biden used his role on the board of Burisma for nefarious means has been completely debunked -- not just by every reputable news organization -- but by President Trump's own former homeland security adviser Tom Bossert. While day two of White House counsel's arguments introduced some new arguments in defense of Trump, it likely did not change the interest from the public, and even some Republicans, to hear from witnesses like Bolton. Republican Sen. Mitt Romney, already on the list of possible votes in favor of witnesses, told reporters, ""John Bolton's relevance to our decision has become increasingly clear."" Though the President may not be on the path to conviction, the trial may bring the Senate one step closer to allowing witnesses. And day two of the defense did not change those odds."
178,CNN,"""Nothing new????"" How can Barrasso -- or, literally, anyone -- make this claim? What the Times report makes clear is this: Bolton is claiming direct evidence -- as in, a conversation with Trump -- of a quid pro quo orchestrated by the President of the United States. Trump, according to the Bolton transcript, said that he wanted the military aid for Ukraine, which had already been approved by Congress, withheld from Ukraine until that country made an announcement that it was investigating the Bidens. If Bolton testifies to that fact -- or even speaks publicly and confirms the basic elements of the Times report -- that is a massive development in this ongoing story. It would suggest that Trump -- and his administration -- have been lying all along about the ""why"" behind the money being withheld. (Trump has said repeatedly that there was never any connection between the withholding of the military aid and his desire that the Ukrainians investigate Joe and Hunter Biden.) Trump's attempts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden and Joe Biden, his potential political rival, are at the center of the President's impeachment trial. Trump has repeatedly made unfounded and false claims to allege that the Bidens acted improperly in Ukraine. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Now, you could say that even if that all is true -- that Trump did tell Bolton to withhold the aid until the Ukrainians moved on the Bidens -- it still doesn't rise to the level of impeachable conduct, particularly with an election less than a year away. In fact, that's the argument Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz made on the Senate floor Monday in defense of Trump. ""Nothing in the Bolton revelations, even if true, would rise to the level of an abuse of power or an impeachable offense, that is clear from the history,"" Dershowitz said. ""That is clear from the language of the Constitution."" What you cannot say is what Barrasso said. It's beyond laughable.  Nothing new? Nothing new except a top Trump administration official reportedly writing that he had a one-on-one conversation with Trump in which the President made clear that the hold-up in military aid for Ukraine was directly tied to the lack of an announcement of an investigation into his top Democratic political rival in 2020. The intellectual dishonesty to say something like what Barrasso said is staggering. And whether you are a Republican or a Democrat, a liberal, a conservative or none of the above, you have to understand how incredibly corrosive this sort of sticking-your-head-in-the-sand behavior is for the strength and health of our overall democracy. You just have to."
179,CNN,"The White House's defense will resume at 1 p.m. ET Tuesday for its final allotted day for opening arguments.  While Bolton was barely mentioned during the proceedings Monday, the allegations that Trump had told him US security aid to Ukraine was conditioned on that country investigating the President's political rivals dominated the conversation outside the chamber among the senators who will decide whether witnesses will testify in the impeachment trial. Two key moderate Republicans said the Bolton news strengthened the case for having witnesses at the trial -- and Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah predicted it was ""increasingly likely"" that other Republicans would now join him in calling for Bolton to testify.  But other GOP senators, including in Republican leadership, downplayed or dismissed the developments and stayed firm in opposition to witnesses. Democrats ramped up their push for witnesses in light of the Bolton news, and some Republican senators discussed whether there should be a trade if witnesses are called.  It's a conversation that has shifted far from where the President's lawyers and GOP senators thought they would be going this week, after Republicans had appeared confident when leaving Washington on Saturday that they had the votes to defeat a motion for additional witnesses and documents, leading to an acquittal vote by the end of the week. Now that's all in doubt. Jay Sekulow, the President's private counsel, alluded to the Bolton allegations during his opening remarks but suggested the issue would not be discussed by the team on Monday. ""We deal with transcript evidence, we deal with publicly available information. We do not deal with speculation, allegations that are not based on evidentiary standards at all,"" he said. Instead, the defense team focused its energy on the Bidens, using two presentations to attack Joe Biden and his son for Hunter Biden's taking a job on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company.  Both Romney and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said the Bolton news had strengthened the case for witnesses, and that they were likely to support it. Other key GOP moderates remained on the fence: Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said she was ""still curious"" about Bolton's testimony and Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee said he'd make a decision when the opportunity to vote on witnesses comes. Republicans mixed on Bolton allegation Underscoring how unsettled the Bolton revelations had left some in the Senate Republican conference, Sen. Pat Toomey proposed the idea of a ""one-for-one"" witness trade with Democrats during the party's closed-door lunch. The idea has been pinging around among Republicans for weeks, but the Pennsylvania Republican's decision to bring it up during the GOP lunch, which was first reported by The Washington Post, signaled the fluidity of the moment as senators attempted to grapple with the developments.  Senate GOP aides cautioned that the idea, at least at this point, is premature and Republican leaders urged the conference to hear out the remainder of the White House presentation before considering any deals or agreements. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, for his part, told his conference to ""take a deep breath,"" according to senators in the room, making clear that the trial rules allow for a witness vote later in the process, and decisions should be held off until then.  It remains the Kentucky Republican's strong preference, sources say, to defeat the witness vote altogether and he's continued to warn his members of the fallout of moving toward subpoenas for witnesses and documents, ranging from an elongated trial to creating new precedents on impeachment and executive privilege they may come to regret.  At this point, GOP sources say the four Republican votes necessary to move forward on witnesses haven't come to the forefront, though three are considered a near-certainty right now: Collins, Romney and Murkowski. The fourth, however, ""hasn't shown his or herself, so everyone's just trying to feel their way through this,"" one Republican senator told CNN. In the hours after The New York Times broke the Bolton story, Republican senators began reaching out to the White House to control the damage. Both Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and McConnell were in communication and there was an expressed view that the GOP-led Senate should have been kept in the loop. One message conveyed to the White House, according to a GOP senator with knowledge of the conversations, was that Republicans were on the front lines of the trial and for them to be left without all available information was ""malpractice."" Democrats seized on the new Bolton allegations, arguing that anyone seeking to learn the truth should want to hear from the President's former national security adviser in light of the revelations. ""It completely blasts another hole in the President's defense,"" said House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff. The California Democrat, the lead House impeachment manager, said the Bolton news ""makes it all the more clear why you can't have a meaningful trial without witnesses and you certainly can't have one without one without John Bolton."" Trump's defense continues The President denied Bolton's allegations on Twitter early Monday morning, and continued to attack the impeachment trial and the managers as the trial resumed. On the Senate floor, the President's legal team focused elsewhere. Sekulow argued that Democrats conducted ""a pattern and practice of attempts over a three year period to not only interfere with the President's ability to govern,"" which he called ""unsuccessful."" Early in the day, former independent counsel Kenneth Starr, who led the investigation leading to President Bill Clinton's impeachment, warned senators they were in what ""can aptly be described as the age of impeachment,"" as he argued that Trump's impeachment was setting a dangerous standard, failed to charge the President with a crime and moved forward despite lacking any Republican support. ""Like war, impeachment is hell, or, at least, presidential impeachment is hell,"" Starr said. ""Those of us who lived through the Clinton impeachment understand that in a deep and personal way."" Pam Bondi, the former Florida attorney general and a member of the President's defense team, used her 30-minute presentation on the Senate floor to outline Hunter Biden's involvement on the board of Burisma, the first direct reference to the Bidens during the defense team's presentations.  House managers, she said, ""repeatedly referenced"" Biden and Burisma more than ""400 times"" during their presentations last week. Citing multiple news reports and testimony from witnesses, Bondi cast the company as corrupt and Biden's involvement as a conflict of interest. She questioned his qualifications to serve on the board, an opportunity she called ""nepotistic at best, nefarious at worst."" Trump's attempts to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens are at the center of the President's impeachment trial. Trump has repeatedly made unfounded and false claims to allege that the Bidens acted improperly in Ukraine. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. And in her first remarks during the trial, Trump lawyer Jane Raskin offered a robust defense of Rudy Giuliani, saying that House managers did not provide ""any direct evidence"" incriminating the former New York City mayor and insisting he was not on a ""political errand"" for Trump, but rather defending his client. ""Yes, Mayor Giuliani was President Trump's personal attorney, but he was not on a political errand. As he stated repeatedly and publicly, he was doing what good defense attorneys do, he was following a lead from a well-known private investigator, and he was gathering evidence regarding Ukrainian election interference to defend his client against the false allegations being investigated by special counsel Mueller,"" Raskin said. She described Giuliani as a ""minor player -- that shiny object designed to distract you."" The mood in the Senate chamber was somber as the defense team presented their argument, with Republicans and some Democrats taking copious notes. Senators were present and, largely, attentive, with few absences and no signs of any fidget spinners.   What happens next After the defense team concludes its arguments, there will be 16 hours for senators to ask questions of both sides. The Senate's trial rules then call for a debate and vote on whether the Senate generally should seek more witnesses and documents. If that vote fails, the trial is likely to conclude with an acquittal vote this week. But if it succeeds, the trial will enter into an unpredictable phase where both senators and the legal teams could propose witnesses, which the Senate could vote on. In addition to the debate over Bolton's testimony, Schiff argued that the Senate must also seek his notes -- as House Democrats were stonewalled from receiving documents from the Trump administration during the impeachment inquiry, even from witnesses who testified before the House. ""We learned John Bolton took detailed notes and presumably these are contemporaneous. These notes took place while the events were happening, while they were fresh in his mind. Those in many respects are more important than the manuscript,"" Schiff said. ""We ought to not only have John Bolton testify but we ought to see what he wrote down in his notes at the time."" This story has been updated with additional developments Monday."
180,CNN,"""The witness vote was always going to be tough,"" said one source involved in the strategy. ""The story makes that clear again."" Democrats quickly highlighted the Times report to bolster their calls for Bolton to testify. Here's a look at the procedural process before any witness testifies publicly: Once the Senate is done hearing arguments from Trump's defense team, there will then be up to 16 hours of senator questions submitted in writing and then four hours of debate on whether to subpoena witnesses and documents. After the debate, the Senate will vote. If that motion gets 51 votes, then the Senate could move ahead with further votes to determine who to subpoena, including Bolton. If 51 senators then vote to subpoena Bolton, the Senate resolution says he first must be privately deposed. After that, the Senate would have to decide whether to make him testify in public. This means that the trial could be in limbo for sometime if the Senate decides to subpoena Bolton, especially given the legal battles that may ensue from any potential White House attempts to block the testimony. But if the Senate defeats the first motion to subpoena witnesses and documents, Trump may soon be acquitted. The purported revelations from Bolton come as the President's legal team begins to take control of the Senate floor to deliver their arguments, detailing the defense of Trump after three days of listening to arguments from the House impeachment managers. The defense counsel's presentation Saturday sought to poke holes in the Democratic case, arguing the House didn't provide the full context during their argument and using snippets of witness testimony from the House Intelligence Committee to argue there was no quid pro quo with Ukraine. ""We don't believe that they have come anywhere close to meeting their burden for what they're asking you to do,"" White House counsel Pat Cipollone said. ""In fact, we believe that when you hear the facts, and that's what we intend to cover today -- the facts -- you will find that the President did absolutely nothing wrong."" But where will Trump's defense team go in the week ahead? Well, Biden is expecting some attention.  ""Look, they've been going full bore at me all the time and all it's gone is gone up,"" Biden told CNN on Sunday in Des Moines, Iowa. ""Look, you guys know it's a bunch of malarkey."" Speaking briefly to reporters after an event with the International Association of Bridge, Structural and Ornamental Iron Workers, Biden said he does not feel he will need to respond to the defense team as it resumes its presentation this week. Biden said ""I'm expecting they will"" make him a focus, adding, ""That's why (Trump's) in trouble."" Witness watch Even before Sunday's New York Times story, Sen. Mitt Romney said that it's ""very likely"" that he'll be in favor of calling witnesses in the impeachment trial, but won't decide until after opening arguments. Remember: Democrats need four Republicans to vote with them in favor of subpoenas for witnesses or new evidence in order to extend the trial and gather new information. Realistically, there are only maybe four GOP senators who would vote in favor of calling witnesses who could testify against the President. That short list includes Romney, relative moderates Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and endangered senators up for reelection like Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado. Collins and Murkowski have also signaled that they're open to hearing from witnesses, should they feel it's needed after opening arguments. Nadler to miss parts of Senate trial  House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler on Sunday announced he will miss parts of the ongoing Senate impeachment trial to help take care of his wife as she undergoes cancer treatment. ""In December, following the House Judiciary Committee markup of the Articles of Impeachment against President Donald J. Trump, my wife was admitted to the hospital where she was diagnosed with Pancreatic Cancer. She has undergone surgery and is taking further steps to address the spread of the cancer,"" Nadler said in a statement on Sunday. ""On Monday, I will be in New York with her to meet with doctors, determine a path forward, and begin her treatment. I am sorry to miss some of the Senate Impeachment Trial, which is of critical importance to our democracy."" As a House impeachment manager, Nadler is part of a select group of lawmakers acting as prosecutors for House Democrats and arguing the case against Trump in the Ukraine scandal -- and he's already played a key part in the House managers' efforts to present a constitutional case for removing Trump from office. The latest House manager gets personal -- On the final day of the opening argument to remove Trump from office, the lead impeachment manager, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, first turned to the little known Rep. Jason Crow of Colorado. Crow, a freshman Congressman and military veteran, took on a key Republican argument: after a couple of months, the aid was released and Ukraine never announced the investigation into Biden sought by Trump. ""This defense would be laughable if this issue wasn't so serious,"" Crow countered. ""Real people, real lives are at stake. Every day, every hour matters. So no, the delay wasn't meaningless. Just ask the Ukrainians sitting in trenches right now."" Trump's attorney gets the SNL treatment -- Trump's attorney Alan Dershowitz, played by guest star Jon Lovitz, wound up in hell during the ""Saturday Night Live"" cold open. Lovitz's Dershowitz was meeting with Sens. Mitch McConnell (Beck Bennett) and Susan Collins (Cecily Strong) about the impeachment trial before he had a heart attack. House manager's hope -- House impeachment manager Zoe Lofgren said Sunday she hopes Republican senators who have disagreed with a quote during the House's opening arguments won't let it shape their decision on whether Trump committed high crimes or misdemeanors. Asked by CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" if it was a ""mistake"" for Schiff, the lead Democratic impeachment manager, to quote a CBS News report during the final day of his team's opening arguments, Lofgren, also a California Democrat, said she doesn't know if it was. ""But hopefully the senators are not going to be letting a -- quoting a CBS report which Adam himself said (he) didn't know if that was accurate in making a decision for the country in whether the President has committed high crimes and misdemeanors,"" she said. ""I can't believe the President's misbehavior would be ignored because of something like that."" Parnas recording puts GOP on defense The GOP is navigating the fallout of a nearly 90-minute recording released Saturday of Trump at a 2018 donor dinner that included indicted businessman Lev Parnas, the Soviet-born businessman the President has claimed he doesn't know.  The tape features Trump speaking animatedly about removing the US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch -- at one point stating, ""Get rid of her!"" On Sunday, CNN's Tapper pressed Republican Sen. James Lankford on the tape in an exchange that shows how far the GOP will go to defend the President. Tapper: ""...when asked about Parnas, President Trump said 'I don't know anything about him.' This proves that's not true.""  Lankford: ""Yeah, this was a fundraising dinner back in the spring of 2018, a year and a half ago, where the President literally takes a bunch of pictures, he walks in, sits down at a dinner. It's a dinner, 25 people or so. They have dinner and then he leaves. I don't see that as a relationship."" Tapper: ""It's a 90-minute recording."" Lankford: ""I understand that, but it's a dinner. It's 90 minutes over a dinner that he walks in and actually participates in this. It's hard to be able to say to the President who meets a thousand people a day. Okay, do you know this person that was at a dinner with you a year and a half ago and to say you have a relationship..."" Head here for a refresher on Trump's other interactions with Parnas.  Fact-checking Trump's legal team Trump's legal team kicked off their opening arguments in the Senate impeachment trial Saturday morning.  In defending the President, Deputy White House Counsel Mike Purpura asserted the case is based on a set of key facts ""that have not and will not change."" Here's a breakdown of these ""facts"" and other claims from CNN's Facts First team: Purpura said ""the transcript shows that the President did not condition either security assistance or a meeting on anything. The paused security assistance funds aren't even mentioned on the call."" Facts First: While no specific conditions for a quid pro quo were mentioned on the call, the exchange Trump had with Zelenksy raised eyebrows among some officials who listened to the phone conversation -- because the US was withholding military aid from Ukraine at the time. Aiming to make the case that Trump did not engage in a quid pro quo because the Ukrainians got what they wanted without ever announcing an investigation into the 2016 election or the Bidens, Purpura argued ""a presidential meeting took place on September 25 without the Ukrainian government announcing any investigations."" Facts First: This is misleading. While an announcement of investigations never took place, it was planned and discussed between representatives of both the US and Ukraine. The plan was only halted after the withheld aid was released. One key fact Purpura claimed was that ""not a single witness testified that the President himself said that there was any connection between any investigations and security assistance, a presidential meeting or anything else."" Facts First: It's true witnesses did not testify the President said anything about a quid pro quo, but other administration officials have testified to the existence of one. The scenes you won't see on TV Press access to the Senate chamber for the impeachment trial has been severely restricted, and the only television coverage is through cameras controlled by the Senate itself. But sketch artist Bill Hennessy has been at the impeachment trial this week, painting the scene on the Senate floor on day one, two, three, and four.  Here's some of what he saw Saturday:"
181,CNN,"If the Democratic managers can't convince Republican senators to change their votes, the least they can do is prevent them from getting away with it in the court of public opinion.  The President, who always has an eye for television and the media, wanted to make sure that Senate Republicans will have enough material to justify their actions when they vote to exonerate him.  Trump will inevitably use impeachment to fuel a narrative that will be central to his 2020 campaign. He will argue -- as he has many times before -- that the Democrats are engaged in an endless campaign to remove him from office and that his actions have been totally legitimate and in the interests of the country. Although we didn't hear much of it Saturday, it seems likely the defense team will accuse former Vice President Joe Biden and his son of corruption, even though there is no evidence of wrongdoing from either of them. If they go down that route, the President's lawyers would effectively use the impeachment process to drive home the exact message the President wanted Ukraine to help him with many months ago. Will this be effective in making certain that Senate Republicans stand firm when it comes time for the votes on witnesses and whether to convict Trump? Probably. Not because Trump's lawyers are making a good case, but because intense partisanship within the GOP has ensured that the so-called moderate Republicans would never buckle. This lowered the bar as to what Cipollone had to accomplish. The defense team just has to do enough to give Republicans sufficient cover to acquit the President.  "

183,CNN,"Trump keeps simultaneously promising to protect people with pre-existing conditions and attempting to reduce protections for people with pre-existing conditions. As we've repeatedly noted, Trump has supported unsuccessful Republican legislation that would weaken protections offered by Obamacare -- and he is currently backing a Republican lawsuit that has asked the courts to kill Obamacare in full.  Last week, he turned the empty pledge about the future into egregious nonsense about the past. Criticizing an ad from Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg, Trump tweeted, ""I was the person who saved Pre-Existing Conditions in your Healthcare, you have it now...""   At CNN, we start with the facts. Visit CNN's home for Facts First. That's absurd. People ""have it"" only because Trump's opponents have blocked his attempts to get rid of it.  The most revealing false claim: Vindman and the rough transcript Trump got at least a little bit of helpful testimony in November from Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the National Security Council expert on Ukraine who was critical of Trump's July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.  Vindman testified that there were some words missing from the rough transcript of the call, and that his requests to add these words to the document were unsuccessful. But Vindman also emphasized that the document was still ""substantively correct,"" that there was nothing ""nefarious"" about the words being left out, and that the omissions were not ""that big a deal.""  Instead of mentioning this truth, Trump falsely claimed last week that the omissions had been fixed at Vindman's request. ""The transcript was perfectly accurate. And now everybody agrees because it went through a lot and they said, 'Well, could you add one word here?' Our lieutenant colonel said, 'Well, I think they should add...' -- they added the word,"" he told reporters.  The most absurd false claim: Mexico and the wall One of Trump's most memorable 2016 rally shticks was a call-and-response segment.  Trump would ask his crowds who was going to pay for his wall on the Mexico border. The crowds would respond with Trump's implausible promise: ""Mexico!""  Mexico has not paid for the wall, though it has helped Trump thwart migrants in other ways. Needing billions more for the project than Congress has been willing to appropriate, Trump has been diverting taxpayer funds from the military.  So, naturally, Trump told a rally crowd last week: ""And by the way, they think they caught me -- they never catch us -- because, you know: Mexico's paying for the wall. You know that. You'll see that. It's all worked out. Mexico spent -- it's driving them crazy."" He then pivoted to a promise that ""Mexico will pay."" Then, reverting to his reality TV past, he vaguely promised a dramatic reveal at some future point: ""And here's the thing, here's the thing, you'll see that. It'll come out. We'll do it sometime during the debate or maybe before our debate, the real debate that people are going to watch."" We will await the big moment. Here is the full list of 49 false claims, starting with the ones we haven't previously included in one of these weekly roundups: Ukraine and impeachment Vindman and the rough transcript ""Fortunately, I released the transcript of the call. The transcript was perfectly accurate. And now everybody agrees because it went through a lot and they said, 'Well, could you add one word here?' Our lieutenant colonel said, 'Well, I think they should add...' -- they added the word. Everything -- everyone agrees the transcript is perfecto, done by total professionals, right?"" -- January 16 exchange with reporters after remarks on prayer in public schools  Facts First: In fact, Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the National Security Council's top Ukraine expert, testified in the House impeachment inquiry that two ""substantive"" changes he suggested to the rough transcript of Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky were not made. As we have noted before, the document Trump released explicitly says on its first page that it is ""not a verbatim transcript.""  Vindman testified that he had wanted to change the words ""the company"" to ""Burisma,"" the company name he said Zelensky had used on his call with Trump. And Vindman testified that he had wanted to add in Trump saying ""there are recordings"" related to former Vice President Joe Biden and a Ukrainian prosecutor Biden had pushed Ukrainian leaders to fire. (Trump was vague about what he meant; in public comments last fall, Trump brought up a video of Biden at a 2018 event telling the story of his effort to get the prosecutor ousted.)  Vindman testified that the transcript was ""substantively correct"" even without the changes he had proposed. ""When I first saw the transcript without the two substantive items that I had attempted to include, I didn't see that as nefarious. I just saw it as, OK, no big deal. You know, these might be meaningful, but it's not that big a deal,"" he told the House Intelligence Committee in November.  What Ukraine's foreign minister said Defending his July call with Zelensky, Trump said: ""The foreign minister said, 'They want to impeach, impeach the President of the United States over a perfect phone call.'"" -- January 14 campaign rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin  ""You have now the Ukrainian President and the Foreign Minister of Ukraine saying there was nothing done wrong. In fact, they said there was absolutely no pressure whatsoever. Everything was perfect."" -- January 16 exchange with reporters after remarks on prayer in public schools  Facts First: Ukraine's president and foreign minister have made comments that bolster Trump's argument that he did not pressure Ukraine to investigate his opponents in order to receive US military aid -- but the foreign minister has never called the phone call ""perfect"" or complained that Trump's opponents were trying to impeach him over a ""perfect"" call, and the president has not said that Trump did nothing wrong. The foreign minister, Vadym Prystaiko, has said ""I have never seen a direct relationship between investigations and security assistance,"" according to Reuters, citing Russian news service Interfax. And Prystaiko has said Trump's July phone call with Zelensky was ""friendly"" and that ""I think there was no pressure.""  Zelensky said had been ""no pressure"" from Trump and made other statements to that effect, but he has not gone so far as to say Trump did nothing wrong or that everything was perfect. In an interview published by Time magazine in early December, Zelensky did say, ""Look, I never talked to the President from the position of a quid pro quo. That's not my thing."" But Zelensky continued: ""I don't want us to look like beggars. But you have to understand. We're at war. If you're our strategic partner, then you can't go blocking anything for us. I think that's just about fairness. It's not about a quid pro quo. It just goes without saying."" Trump could tout these comments. Instead, he touted a comment they did not make. The public response to Trump's Ukraine calls ""Now, so you have these perfect calls, and everybody says it now. Before they knew they were so good -- because, fortunately, they were transcribed -- you had other people saying terrible things about the calls."" -- January 16 exchange with reporters after remarks on prayer in public schools  Facts First: This is an obvious exaggeration. It is clearly not true that ""everybody"" says Trump's phone calls with Zelensky were ""perfect"" or even good. Democratic members of the Congress continue to cite the July call as key evidence supporting Trump's impeachment. Media A Very Stable Genius ""Another Fake Book by two third rate Washington Post reporters, has already proven to be inaccurately reported, to their great embarrassment, all for the purpose of demeaning and belittling a President who is getting great things done for our Country, at a record clip."" -- January 18 tweet  Facts First: Trump was almost certainly referring to ""A Very Stable Genius,"" a new book by Washington Post journalists Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig. The book has not been ""proven to be inaccurately reported,"" nor has there been any sign that the authors are embarrassed about anything they included. The New York Times  Trump said The New York Times is ""a newspaper that was going broke until I came along."" -- January 18 tweet   Facts First: There was no sign The New York Times was ""going broke"" prior to Trump launching his presidential candidacy in mid-2015. (Trump didn't specify what he meant by ""until I came along,"" but that seems like the earliest reasonable starting point.) The New York Times Company was profitable in 2013 and 2014. While the company reported a $14 million loss in the first quarter of 2015, it reported a $16 million gain in the second quarter of 2015, more than two thirds of which occurred before Trump began his campaign in mid-June. Democrats Pelosi, Sanders and impeachment  ""They are rigging the election again against Bernie Sanders, just like last time, only even more obviously. They are bringing him out of so important Iowa in order that, as a Senator, he sit through the Impeachment Hoax Trial. Crazy Nancy thereby gives the strong edge to Sleepy Joe Biden, and Bernie is shut out again. Very unfair, but that's the way the Democrats play the game. Anyway, it's a lot of fun to watch!"" -- January 17 tweet  ""They are taking the Democrat Nomination away from Crazy Bernie, just like last time. Some things never change!"" -- January 18 tweet   Facts First: There is no evidence for either Trump's general claim that ""they"" are rigging the Democratic presidential primary to hurt the chances of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, nor for the specific claim that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi scheduled Trump's impeachment trial to damage Sanders' chances in Iowa.  Sanders responded to Trump's claim with his own tweet: ""Let's be clear about who is rigging what: it is Donald Trump's action to use the power of the federal government for his own political benefit that is the cause of the impeachment trial. Democrats are going to unite to sweep him out of the White House in November.""  The New York Times reported that Pelosi deputy chief of staff Drew Hammill said, ""Senator Sanders isn't the only senator running, so this doesn't make any sense.""  Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Michael Bennet of Colorado are also candidates.  Chuck Schumer and the China deal ""They asked one of our Democratic -- Cryin' Chuck Schumer -- 'What do you think of the deal?' -- two weeks ago. He had no idea what the deal was. Never saw the deal; it's totally guarded. 'I don't like it. I don't like the deal,' he said. 'Well, have you seen it?' ""Yeah, I think I know what...' 'Well, why don't you like it?' 'Well, they took the tariffs off.' Actually, we didn't. He didn't know anything about the deal. He just said exactly what probably you should say, as a politician. 'How do you like the deal?' 'I don't like the deal.' 'Do you know the deal?' 'Uh, uh, sort of.' He never saw the deal. He knew nothing about it."" -- January 15 speech on signing of ""phase one"" trade agreement with China  Facts First: There was no exchange in which Schumer, the Democrats' Senate leader, said, ""Uh, uh, sort of"" when asked if he knows the contents of Trump's China deal, or that he conceded he merely thinks he knows what's in it. Also, the deal does reduce, though not eliminate, some of the US tariffs on imported Chinese products. After Trump made this accusation on January 15, Schumer responded the same day: ""I know what's in the deal. I'm not sure the President does. If he knows what's in the deal -- he should throw it away and take China back to the negotiating table. I will cheer him on if he does.""  Foreign affairs Locating Baghdadi  Recounting the US military raid that resulted in the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Trump said, ""We found him about a month-and-a-half ago. Again, a person walks in from the CIA and says, 'Sir, we have him.' I said, 'You have who.' 'Al-Baghdadi.' I said, 'You got to be kidding.'"" -- January 17 fundraiser (audio obtained by CNN's Kevin Liptak)  Facts First: We don't know when Trump was informed that Baghdadi's location in Syria had been identified, but it was clearly more than ""a month-and-a-half ago."" He died on October 26, more than two-and-a-half months prior to this claim, so Trump would have been inaccurate even if he was talking about the raid itself. We might let this go if it was a one-time slip, but it wasn't. Intentionally or unintentionally, Trump has repeatedly moved the dates of his accomplishments closer to the present.  Soleimani and Hezbollah Trump spoke about the January 3 airstrike in Baghdad that killed Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani and associate Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, deputy leader of Iraq's Popular Mobilization Forces, an umbrella organization of Iraqi militant groups. He said, ""He [Soleimani] got off the plane and they said, 'Sir, and he met the head of Hezbollah, we get two for the price of one. He met the head of Hezbollah.'"" -- January 17 fundraiser (audio obtained by CNN's Kevin Liptak)  Facts First: Trump referred inaccurately to Muhandis -- a founder of Iraq-based militant group Kataib Hezbollah, which is separate from the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah. The head of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, was not with Soleimani and is still alive. It's possible that Trump was confused because Soleimani had met with Nasrallah in Beirut in the days before the airstrike, according to Nasrallah.  The difference between Hezbollah (which means Party of God) and Kataib Hezbollah (which means Brigades of the Party of God) is not trivial. Though both groups are backed by Iran, and though Kataib Hezbollah is known to have received support from Hezbollah, they are ""entirely independent entities,"" said journalist Hala Jaber, author of the 1997 book ""Hezbollah: Born With a Vengeance.""  The groups ""do have shared, common interests and ideologies, no question,"" and do support each other, but they are distinct organizations with their own country-specific reasons for existing, Jaber said. Trade The size of Trump's trade deals Trump called the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and the ""phase one"" trade deal with China ""the two biggest trade deals in the world ever done."" He specified that the China deal is ""the biggest deal ever done in the history of our country."" -- January 16 exchange with reporters after remarks on prayer in public schools ""We just made the two largest trade deals in history: one with China and the other one with Mexico, Canada."" -- January 17 speech at event for college football champion Louisiana State University  Facts First: ""Biggest"" can be defined in different ways, but trade experts say neither deal is among the two biggest trade deals in US history. ""Since 'biggest trade deal' has no standard meaning, it may be possible to justify his statements by constructing a measure that fits it and by limiting the number of trade agreements that one compares to. But by any sensible interpretation, he's wrong,"" said Alan Deardorff, a University of Michigan professor of international economics who focuses on trade. Deardorff said: ""Both deals, measured in terms of the volume of trade that they cover, are smaller than the Trans-Pacific Partnership that Obama negotiated, and much smaller than the Uruguay Round that created the World Trade Organization."" The USMCA includes the US, Canada and Mexico. The Trans-Pacific Partnership, from which Trump withdrew the US, included all three of those countries but also nine others. Also, the USMCA is a modification to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) rather than a deal created from scratch; many of its changes are small. Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said that George W. Bush granting China the status of permanent normal trade relations in 2001 was ""far bigger"" than Trump's preliminary deal with China, covering a far greater number of subjects (tariffs, non-tariff barriers, investment and others). Hufbauer also noted that it is not clear if the China deal's pledged increase in purchases of US exports -- $200 billion in additional purchases over two years -- will actually materialize. Washing machine tariffs Trump said that South Korean companies are building washing machine factories in the United States ""because they don't want to pay the 25% tariff."" -- January 14 campaign rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin Facts First: There is no Trump washing machine tariff of 25%. In the first year of his tariffs on washing machines, which took effect in 2018, the tariff was 20% on the first 1.2 million imports, then 50% on additional imports. In the second year, it is 18% on the first 1.2 million imports, then 45% on additional imports. In the third year, it is 16% on the first 1.2 million, then 40% on additional imports.  Trump might well have made an innocent slip rather than an intentional falsehood, but this was at least the sixth time he has cited an inaccurate percentage for these tariffs.  Trump's 2016 crowds in Texas ""I remember 2016 -- the election. And the fake news -- these people back here -- they were going -- they were saying, 'Trump: going to have a hard time winning Texas.' And we came. We made speeches...Remember? We'd have 25-, 30,000 people standing on line. Can't get in. And I said, 'Why am I going to have a hard time with Texas?'"" -- January 19 speech to the American Farm Bureau Federation  Facts First: There is no evidence to support this claim. Trump has repeatedly exaggerated the number of supporters stuck outside his events unable to get in.  After his rally in Dallas in 2015 during the Republican primary, the Dallas News reported that ""up to 20,000 people were expected, but the upper levels of the arena were largely empty...arena personnel estimated attendance at about 15,000."" The Texas Tribune reported that Trump's February 2016 rally in Fort Worth did not have a ""capacity crowd,"" either.  When Trump claimed that thousands of supporters were stuck outside a June 2016 rally at a Dallas entertainment venue with a capacity under 5,000, local radio station KERA News said it was really 100 to 200. NBC reported that ""several thousand"" were turned away from a June 2016 rally in The Woodlands, but there were no reports that the number was anywhere near 25,000; that venue had a capacity of about 5,000.  Mexico and the wall ""You know with the wall: we're building a wall. You know that, right?... And by the way, they think they caught me -- they never catch us -- because, you know: Mexico's paying for the wall. You know that. You'll see that. It's all worked out. Mexico spent -- it's driving them crazy. Now they say, 'OK, he's building the wall, but Mexico didn't pay.' Mexico will pay. And here's the thing, here's the thing, you'll see that. It'll come out. We'll do it sometime during the debate or maybe before our debate, the real debate that people are going to watch."" -- January 14 campaign rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin Facts First: Mexico is still not paying for Trump's border wall, which his administration is seeking to fund in part with taxpayer money appropriated by Congress and in part with taxpayer money taken from the military. Mexico is spending a significant amount of money to help the US on migration issues, deploying thousands of troops to both its Guatemala border and its US border to thwart would-be asylum seekers. It's possible to argue that this is like Mexico paying for a kind of human wall. But Trump's wall is an actual, physical project that Mexico is not funding. The Trump administration says that about 101 miles of wall had been built on the Mexican border as of January 10. Only one of these miles was built in places where no barriers had existed before; the other 100 miles replaced or reinforced previously existing barriers.   Chuck Grassley and James Comey Trump said of Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley: ""This guy is the toughest guy. He can say something in a nice manner and everybody is afraid. Right? He made Comey choke during the hearing. He said, 'Did you leak anything to the press?' 'What? What? What? What?' Comey choked like a dog, and he was being nice when he said it."" -- January 15 speech on signing of ""phase one"" trade agreement with China Facts First: James Comey did not say anything like ""What? What? What? What?"" when Grassley asked him at a May 2017 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing about whether he had any role in leaks to the media.  Grassley said, ""It is frustrating when the FBI refuses to answer this committee's questions, but leaks relevant information to the media. In other words, they don't talk to us, but somebody talks to the media. Director Comey, have you ever been an anonymous source in news reports about matters relating to the Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation?"" Comey responded, ""Never."" Grassley: ""Question two, relatively related: Have you ever authorized someone else at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports about the Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation?"" Comey: ""No."" Grassley: ""Has any classified information relating to President Trump or his association -- associates been declassified and shared with the media?"" Comey: ""Not to my knowledge."" Repeats Here are the repeat false claims we have previously fact checked in a weekly roundup: Ukraine and impeachment The accuracy of the whistleblower  ""You had a fake whistleblower that wrote a report that bore no relationship to what was said. Everything was false."" -- January 16 exchange with reporters after remarks on prayer in public schools Facts First: The whistleblower's account of Trump's July call with Zelensky has been proven highly accurate. In fact, the rough transcript released by Trump himself showed that the whistleblower's three primary allegations about the call were correct or very close to correct. You can read a full fact check here. The House impeachment proceedings ""Cryin' Chuck Schumer just said, 'The American people want a fair trial in the Senate.' True, but why didn't Nervous Nancy and Corrupt politician Adam 'Shifty' Schiff give us a fair trial in the House. It was the most lopsided & unfair basement hearing in the history of Congress!"" -- January 14 tweet  Facts First: The House did not hold a ""trial"" at all. Under the Constitution, it is the Senate that has the sole power to try impeachments. This is not merely a matter of semantics. During the House impeachment process, Republicans complained that Trump was being denied constitutional rights afforded to criminal defendants -- wrongly suggesting to the public that the House process was tantamount to a trial. The House proceedings did involve closed-door hearings in a secure room in a Capitol basement, but there were also, of course, subsequent public hearings.  Trump's approval with Republicans ""95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party, A Record. Thank You!"" - January 18 tweet  Facts First: Trump's approval rating among Republicans is very high, regularly in the 80s and sometimes creeping into the 90s, but it has not been 95% in any recent major poll we could find. Trump was at 89% approval with Republicans in a NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll conducted January 7-12, 93% in a Quinnipiac University poll conducted January 8-12, 88% in an Ipsos/Reuters poll conducted January 6-7, 89% in a Gallup poll conducted December 2-15. The Quinnipiac poll at which he was at 93% had an overall margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points, and a larger margin of error for the smaller sub-sample of Republican voters, so that poll found that it's possible Trump's true number is indeed 95% -- but it's not accurate to make leaps from the numbers the polls actually found without explaining that this is what you are doing.  Regardless, Trump's approval rating is not a record. Gallup's website features data on approval rating by party for every president since Harry Truman; George W. Bush hit 99% in Gallup polling after the 9/11 terrorist attacks of 2001. His father, George H.W. Bush, hit 97% at the end of the Gulf War in 1991. Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon, and Dwight Eisenhower all went higher than 90%. Trade China's agricultural spending, part 1  ""But then we started doing the big tariffs -- taking in literally tens of billions of dollars. And we started giving money back. I went to Sonny Perdue. I said, 'Sonny, what did China -- what was the number that China did last year?' He said, 'Sir, they bought $16 billion.' I said, 'Oh, that's good. What did they do the year before?' 'Sir, they bought $12 billion worth of product.' I said, 'Good.' So it's $12 billion. We gave you the $12 billion. Then, $16 billion.  We gave you the $16 billion so you weren't hurt."" -- January 19 speech to the American Farm Bureau Federation Facts First: Trump was significantly understating Chinese agricultural purchases. In 2017, the year before the trade war began, China spent $19.5 billion, according to Department of Agriculture figures. In 2016, it was $21.4 billion. Chinese purchases plummeted to $9.1 billion in 2018. China's agricultural spending, part 2  Trump said ""the most"" China has ever spent on US agricultural products is ""$20 billion."" -- January 19 speech to the American Farm Bureau Federation Facts First: China spent $25.9 billion on American agricultural products in 2012, according to figures from the Department of Agriculture. Economy Energy production Trump claimed three times that the US is ""now"" the world's ""number one"" energy producer. On two of these occasions, he claimed the US had not previously held this status. (On one of these two, he said, ""We weren't even close."") And he claimed the achievement had happened because he ""ended the war on American energy."" Facts First: The US has not just ""now"" become the world's top energy producer: it took the top spot in 2012, according to the US government's Energy Information Administration -- under the very Obama administration Trump is accusing of perpetrating a ""war"" on the industry. The US became the top producer of crude oil in particular during Trump's tenure. ""The United States has been the world's top producer of natural gas since 2009, when US natural gas production surpassed that of Russia, and it has been the world's top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013, when its production exceeded Saudi Arabia's,"" the Energy Information Administration says. Household income Trump claimed twice that real median household income has increased by $10,000 during his presidency. In addition to $5,000 in ""wage gains,"" he added $3,100 from ""regulatory cuts"" and $2,500 for ""energy savings."" Facts First: It's not true that household income gains under Trump have already hit $10,000 in less than three years. A firm called Sentier Research found pre-tax income gains of about $5,000 between January 2017 and November 2019. Savings from energy or from regulation would be included in the pre-tax gains, not added over top of them. You can read a longer fact check here. The estate tax  Trump twice claimed to have eliminated the estate tax, emphasizing that this would benefit small farmers. Facts First: Trump has not eliminated the federal estate tax. His 2017 tax law raised the threshold at which the tax must be paid, from $5.5 million to $11.2 million for an individual, but did not get rid of the tax entirely.  It's also misleading to suggest that the estate tax had been a particular burden on small farms and small businesses; very few of them were paying the tax even before Trump's changes came into effect. According to the Tax Policy Center, a mere 50 farms and closely held businesses were among the 5,190 estates to pay the estate tax in 2017, before Trump's tax law. The Center wrote on its website: ""The Tax Policy Center estimates that small farms and businesses will pay $20 million in estate tax in 2017, one-tenth of 1 percentage of the total estate tax revenue.""  The WOTUS rule and puddles ""So, this rule gave bureaucrats virtually unlimited authority to regulate stock tanks, drainage ditches, and isolated ponds as navigable waterways and navigable water. You believe that? Sometimes, you'd have a puddle -- a little puddle. And they'd consider that a lake."" -- January 19 speech to the American Farm Bureau Federation Facts First: Puddles were not covered by the Obama-era Waters of the United States environmental regulation; the rule explicitly said puddles do not qualify as one of the waters in question. A preamble to the rule explained: ""The final rule adds an exclusion for puddles. The proposed rule did not explicitly exclude puddles because the agencies have never considered puddles to meet the minimum standard for being a 'water of the United States,' and it is an inexact term...However, numerous commenters asked that the agencies expressly exclude them in a rule. The final rule does so."" Manufacturing jobs Trump claimed to have added ""600,000"" manufacturing jobs.  Facts First: Trump was exaggerating. The economy added 487,000 manufacturing jobs between January 2017, when Trump took office, and December 2019, official data shows. The number is 514,000 jobs added if you go back to November 2016, the month of Trump's election, as Trump often likes to do. What Obama said about manufacturing jobs ""And our manufacturing numbers are fantastic. You see that. Remember? Manufacturing. Phil, you remember? 'There's no more manufacturing.' And then we have almost 600,000 jobs. They said, the last administration, 'You'd need a magic wand to bring back manufacturing.' So I guess we found the magic wand. We found the magic wand."" -- January 19 speech to the American Farm Bureau Federation Facts First: Trump's ""magic wand"" comment was a reference to a remark President Barack Obama made at a PBS town hall in 2016 -- but he was inaccurately describing what Obama said. Obama never said, ""There's no more manufacturing."" Rather, Obama scoffed at Trump's promises to bring back what Obama called ""jobs of the past"" without providing specifics on how he would do so. Contrary to Trump's repeated claims, Obama didn't say manufacturing was dead or that new manufacturing jobs could not be created; Obama boasted of how many manufacturing jobs were being created during his presidency, saying, ""We actually make more stuff, have a bigger manufacturing base today than we've had in most of our history."" The unemployment rate ""The unemployment rate is now 3.5% -- the lowest in over 51 years, half a century."" -- January 19 speech to the American Farm Bureau Federation Facts First: Trump's ""over 51 years"" is one of his usual slight exaggerations of an already-impressive number. The 3.5% unemployment rate for December 2019 was the lowest since December 1969, exactly 50 years prior. (if you ignore the fact that it was the same 3.5% in November and September).  Immigration Deportations to Latin America Trump said that, prior to his presidency, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador refused to take back criminals the US wanted to deport, but now they do. Facts First: Trump was mixing up two separate issues. While the Trump administration does have new agreements with all three of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, those agreements are related to the handling of people who come to the US seeking asylum, not criminals the US is seeking to deport. In 2016, just prior to Trump's presidency, none of the three countries was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement considered ""recalcitrant"" (uncooperative) in accepting the return of their citizens from the US. Democrats and borders Trump claimed twice that Democrats support ""open borders."" Facts First: Even the Democratic presidential candidates who have advocated the decriminalization of the act of illegally entering the country, such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro (who dropped out of the race earlier this month), do not support completely unrestricted migration, as Trump suggests. A quote about illegal immigration Trump said this is what happened when he claimed that Democrats would give undocumented immigrants Rolls-Royce luxury cars: ""You know, I one time said, 'We're going to get everybody a Rolls-Royce,' and CNN or one of them said, 'They never said -- and they never promised -- a Rolls-Royce, Donald Trump lied tonight.' I said, 'Every illegal alien will have a Rolls-Royce.' They said, 'He lied tonight.'"" -- January 14 campaign rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin Facts First: That is not exactly what happened. Trump did make a joke at a 2018 campaign rally in Arizona about Democrats wanting to give undocumented immigrants a free Rolls-Royce -- but then, at a rally the next day in Nevada, he made a non-joking claim that Democrats want to ""give them cars."" He continued to joke about a Rolls-Royce in particular, but he was challenged on the assertion of fact. He said in Nevada: ""They want to open your borders, let people in, illegally. And then they want to pay for those people for health care, for education. They want to give them cars, they want to give them driver's licenses. I said last night, we did a great -- we did a great, great rally in Arizona last night, and I said -- I said last night, 'What kind of car will they supply them? Will it be a Rolls-Royce?'"" Military and foreign affairs Military spending ""It's rebuilt completely. We spent $2.5 trillion."" -- January 17 fundraiser (audio obtained by CNN's Kevin Liptak) Facts First: Trump was exaggerating. Defense spending for fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019 was $2.05 trillion, and that includes more than three-and-a-half months of Obama's tenure, since the 2017 fiscal year began in October 2016. Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said he thinks Trump must have been including military funding for the 2020 fiscal year to get to the ""$2.5 trillion"" figure -- but the 2020 fiscal year just started on October 1, and Harrison noted that the defense appropriation has not yet been approved by Congress. Ammunition ""And we have the best military in the world. When I came in it was totally depleted, it was gone. We had fighter jets that were 54 years old. And it was terrible...We didn't have ammunition, and now we have so much ammunition we don't know what the hell to do with it."" -- January 17 fundraiser (audio obtained by CNN's Kevin Liptak) Facts First: According to military leaders, there was a shortfall in certain kinds of munitions, particularly precision-guided bombs, late in the Obama presidency and early in the Trump presidency. But the claim that ""we didn't have ammunition"" is a significant exaggeration. Military leaders did not say that they had completely run out of any kind of bomb, let alone ammunition in general. You can read a full fact check of Trump's claims about munitions levels here. Veterans Choice ""Our military is rebuilt. Our -- if you see the VA, you know how well that's doing now. We have Veterans Choice. That was a big difference where you can go out, get a doctor if they can't take care of you immediately. So our vets are taken care of for the first time, really."" -- January 13 interview with WWL-TV in New Orleans  Facts First: The Veterans Choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by Sens. Bernie Sanders and the late John McCain, was signed into law by Obama in 2014. In 2018, Trump signed the VA Mission Act, which expanded and changed the program. Complaints about the VA ""You don't hear complaints about the VA anymore. Do you notice?"" -- January 15 speech on signing of ""phase one"" trade agreement with China Facts First: We can't be sure of what Trump himself has heard about conditions at the VA, but it's just not true that the rest of us no longer hear complaints. Merely since August 2019, there have been news stories about ""11 suspicious deaths at the Louis A. Johnson VA Medical Center,"" ""how Veterans Affairs failed to stop a pathologist who misdiagnosed 3,000 cases"" and wasn't fired until 2018, how ""a Veterans Affairs medical center in West Virginia is being investigated over allegations that one of its physicians sexually assaulted more than a dozen patients,"" and how a veteran at a VA facility in Georgia was allegedly bitten by ants 100 times before his death."" The Turkey-Syria border ""...We did something in Syria. We were guarding their border. At one point, we had thousands of people -- the Syrian border, between Turkey and Syria. It's been there for a thousand years."" -- January 14 campaign rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin Facts First: There is no basis for the claim that there has been fighting over the Turkey-Syria border for 1,000 years; modern-day Turkey and Syria were both part of the Ottoman Empire that was only dissolved after World War I, and the border between them is less than 100 years old. ""The border he refers to -- the Turkish-Syria border -- was established in 1923 with the Treaty of Lausanne and the founding of the Republic of Turkey. The exception to this is the province of Hatay, which passed from Syrian to Turkish control following a referendum,"" said Lisel Hintz, assistant professor of international relations and European studies at Johns Hopkins, who called a previous version of Trump's claim -- in which Trump said there had been fighting for ""2,000"" years -- ""patently and irresponsibly false."" Soldiers in Syria ""So they said, 'Trump stayed in Syria. Trump stayed.' So people said to me, 'Why are you staying in Syria?' Because I kept the oil. Which frankly, we should have done in Iraq, OK, a long time ago. You have no idea the things and the decisions I've seen. So they say, 'Trump stayed in Syria,' I didn't pull out. I did pull out. We have the oil really secure."" -- January 14 campaign rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin Facts First: Trump did not ""pull out"" of Syria; regardless of why he has kept some troops there, they are there. While he did withdraw US troops from the northeastern region in advance of a Turkish offensive in that region, he has kept hundreds of troops in the country. Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in November that there would be ""probably in the 500-ish frame. Maybe 600"" soldiers left in northeast Syria (he said the number would definitely be less than 1,000), in addition to the separate force of more than 100 soldiers stationed in southern Syria near Jordan. Military leaders have said that the US will not keep any revenue from the Syrian oil fields they are securing, but Trump has continued to suggest that the US is seizing the oil for itself. Democrats and Soleimani  ""The Democrats and the Fake News are trying to make terrorist Soleimani into a wonderful guy, only because I did what should have been done for 20 years."" -- January 13 tweet   Facts First: The Democrats were not trying to make the Iranian commander, whom Trump had killed in a US airstrike, sound ""wonderful."" Prominent Democrats, such as the party's presidential candidates and congressional leaders, criticized Trump's decision to order the killing of Soleimani, but they offered no defense of Soleimani's actions or personality. Pelosi, for example, called Soleimani a ""terrible person"" who ""did bad things,"" explicitly emphasizing that her opposition to killing him was not based in any sympathy for him or for Iran. You can read a longer fact check here. Money and the Iran deal  ""Obama gave them $150 billion, $1.8 billion in cash."" -- January 14 campaign rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin Facts First: The sum in question was Iranian money frozen in foreign financial institutions because of sanctions, not US government money -- and experts say the total was significantly lower than $150 billion. You can read a fuller fact check here. Pre-existing conditions ""I stand stronger than anyone in protecting your Healthcare with Pre-Existing Conditions."" -- January 13 tweet   ""Mini Mike Bloomberg is spending a lot of money on False Advertising. I was the person who saved Pre-Existing Conditions in your Healthcare, you have it now, while at the same time winning the fight to rid you of the expensive, unfair and very unpopular Individual Mandate... -- January 13 tweet  ""We will protect patients with pre-existing conditions like nobody else..."" -- January 14 campaign rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin Facts First: Trump is not the person who ""saved"" protections for people with pre-existing conditions. The opposite is true: The Trump administration and congressional Republicans have repeatedly put forward bills and filed lawsuits that would weaken Obamacare's protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Trump is currently supporting a Republican lawsuit that is seeking to declare all of Obamacare void. He has not issued a plan to reinstate the law's protections for people with pre-existing conditions if the suit succeeds. People crying ""I terminated one of the most ridiculous regulations of all: the last administration's disastrous Waters of the United States rule. Thank you. It's gone. That was a rule that basically took your property away from you. I'll never forget: At the White House signing, I had probably 30, 35 people behind me -- farmers and homebuilders and others -- people that haven't cried in many years. People that weren't -- some of them were so tough, they never cried. They didn't cry when they were babies. And they were crying. No, we gave them their life back."" -- January 19 speech to the American Farm Bureau Federation Facts First: We checked the video of this 2017 event, and nobody in the vicinity of Trump was crying. (Trump had previously claimed that ""half"" of the people standing behind him were crying, then made it ""almost all"" of the people.)"
184,CNN,"In a recent conversation, Bryant and I parsed a few of the book's themes. The transcript that follows has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Why did you decide to write a collection of essays about cultural and political dissidence largely through the prism of sports? I'd always had it in mind to write essays about what's happening in sports. That's because I got really frustrated with the notion over the past several years -- especially following the shooting of Trayvon Martin (in 2012) and the unrest in Ferguson (in 2014) -- that sports are politically neutral. I understand the cliché that sports are an escape. But politically neutral? Not only did that idea annoy me -- it's completely false.  Sports fans are in many ways actually hostile when you think about their reactions to Colin Kaepernick or Muhammad Ali or Tommie Smith or John Carlos or anybody who took on any form of political protest in sports. It wasn't neutral. It was hostile. And this relationship gets at the question: If these black athletes are so powerful, why are they risking losing everything? Maybe they don't have that much power after all. Maybe we're equating money with power when they're not the same thing. Having power would mean that you can speak your mind and not be blackballed. I wanted to explore that dynamic because when you look at the NFL and beyond, the sanctions you receive for your blackness or for taking on a black position are becoming harsher and harsher. So what does that really say about the position of the black athlete? Let's continue with Kaepernick. The first essay in your book zooms in on the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback and what he's taught us about how America views blackness. Why's Kaepernick such an apt vehicle for this conversation? We tend to think that athletes are taking the lead on issues: that they're in charge, that they're showing us the way. But I don't think that that's always true. If you look at a story from a chronological standpoint, the athletes often didn't lead it. They followed the people. They followed the protests after the death of Trayvon Martin. They followed the protests after the death of Freddie Gray. They followed the protests after Ferguson. They got involved because the country was getting involved. In this light, the players really weren't that powerful. But one guy who's stood out is Kaepernick. Everyone in sports, especially in the NFL, is reacting to him. I began to notice this after observing how some parts of the culture responded to the fact that Nike tried to rehabilitate him and his name just a little bit by giving him a job: People -- including the police and retailers -- were actually willing to take on Nike because the company was working with Kaepernick. That told me: OK, this culture is trying to destroy this person. There was something bigger taking place than simply: Oh, well, we don't like him because of what he did. He's not even in the game now, and people still want to boycott Nike. On the flip side, you have an essay on the former figure skater Tonya Harding, as portrayed in the 2017 film ""I, Tonya."" You turn the movie's lens on itself to reflect on what it reveals about the racial politics of redemption: ""Harding's rehabilitation, her chance to look into America's face without remorse, regret, or admission and say, 'You did this to me,' was inevitable. ... The film was an ugly counter to all those blacks and browns for whom surviving poverty carries only fault and blame and shame and the ridicule of requiring government assistance, the dreaded 'handout.' "" As I watched ""I, Tonya,"" I was thinking more than anything else: Who has the lens? Whoever has the camera, whoever has the pen, whoever has the opportunity to tell stories, that person gets to decide who gets rehabilitated and who doesn't. That person gets to decide who gets the sympathetic treatment and who doesn't. Harding has been humanized and legitimized as a complex person. She's been allowed to be complex. When I saw that movie, it was around the same time as the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. And you could see a similar rehabilitation of lower-class whites, the same people who somehow take front and center as the only working-class people in America during political campaigns. I imagined that they saw themselves in Harding: Nobody handed me anything. Nobody gives me anything. I'm a fighter. All these different tropes. But when you think about someone like Kaepernick, nobody has ever humanized him. When you watch him in the media, he's usually a business consideration: Oh, well, if you sign him, the fans are going to revolt. If you sign him, he's going to be a distraction. No one talks about him in the same way as Harding or Luke Heimlich. With the black athlete, it's just: Can you help me or can you not help me? The rest isn't important. You also look at superstardom beyond sports, arguing that celebrity, broadly, can be at odds with the American Dream -- the gauzy idea that, with a bit of hard work, you can write your own destiny. Could you elaborate on that? I think that the old notion of the American Dream is slipping away from us. Wealth inequality is so great right now that it can make you wonder: Do we even have a say in our lives? It's like we're expecting LeBron James to save students, or Beyoncé and Jay-Z to put our kids through college. And in our media, we routinely see these heartwarming human stories that I find sort of sad: the 12-year-old selling lemonade for a mom's kidney transplant. I'm thinking: I'm not quite sure that this is what we want to be.  It's sad because even if you want to have a real conversation about, say, mass incarceration or history, nobody's really going to listen to you unless you happen to be a celebrity billionaire. The hero game, as I describe it in the book, is where someone like Kevin Durant helps low-income students with college and that's supposed to replace policy and be acceptable. Well, I don't believe that it is. And I wanted to discuss all of that at a time when we're talking about ""Medicare for All"" and debt forgiveness and free college and the rest of these things. I also write about the related idea of ""falling in love with the gesture."" You can be a completely reprehensible human being, but all you have to do is one visible thing and the public takes that. For instance, there's nothing Trump has done for black Americans that would make him anything remotely heroic. But yet he arguably saw in his 2018 pardon of Jack Johnson, the first black heavyweight boxing champion, who was convicted under a racist law and has been dead since 1946, an opportunity to show that he cares about black people. It's a phenomenon you see all the time in celebrity culture -- using opportunities to rehabilitate yourself. What do you want people to take away from your book? Personally, I'm moved by its blunt honesty -- that making meaningful progress requires confronting a hard truth, which is that this country hasn't come as far as some think that it has. Someone asked me during an interview: Are you depressed that your book seems to resonate? I don't think that writers want their books not to resonate. What I want is for people to really take a look at our culture.  It's not a book about sports only or race only. It's about all of it. I went into this book with the thought that I'm not trying to change your mind. This book isn't a survival guide. It's not about how to be a better person. It's simply how I see the world right now. But I think that it's liberating to acknowledge that we're in hostile territory. And it's not just black people who are in hostile territory. It's you, if you care about our supposed democratic principles -- we're in the middle of an impeachment trial right now. It's you, if you care about wealth inequality and having a chance at this American Dream we say that we believe in. So the book isn't an invitation to check out. It's an invitation to say: Look, I see what the problems are. Let's find ways to make an impact."
185,CNN,"As for the second point, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has stated publicly he felt ""no pressure."" But of course he said that -- he had to. What was he going to do? Publicly announce he feared Trump, potentially alienating the leader of the world's most powerful country as Ukraine struggles to establish democracy and fend off Russia? I've prosecuted more extortion cases than I can remember and, in my experience, victims almost never say they felt pressure -- precisely because they fear the consequences of standing up to the extorter.  Zelensky later hinted at this, stating, ""But you have to understand. We're at war. If you're our strategic partner, then you can't go blocking anything for us."" Indeed, the withheld aid comprised nearly 10% of Ukraine's entire military budget, while that nation was at war with a neighboring power, Russia. It is misleading and disingenuous of Trump's attorneys to cling to this patently ridiculous defense.  Argument 2. Trump is an intrepid, dedicated, international corruption-buster. This one relies on sleight of hand. As President, the argument goes, Trump had the right to take steps to prevent corruption in Ukraine, a recipient of foreign aid.  Fine -- he would have been within his right to fight corruption. But that's simply not what happened.   In fact, Trump pushed Zelensky for two, and only two, investigations -- one on former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, and another into a discredited theory that Ukraine, not Russia interfered in the 2016 election. And the evidence makes clear that Trump seemed to care less about the actual investigations than the public announcement of investigations -- which would serve his own political goals, and not actually combat corruption.  Tellingly, Trump has a dismal record on fighting corruption, and has repeatedly tried to cut spending on anti-corruption programs in Ukraine and other countries. When asked in October 2019 to name any corruption case he had ever pushed for beyond those involving his political opponents, Trump responded: ""We'd have to look."" Over three months later, he's still looking.   Argument 3. Evidence of the corrupt exchange (or 'quid pro quo') was largely speculative and based on presumption.   This argument has some merit. Indeed, much of the evidence introduced in the House was based on the presumptions -- usually reasonable and well-founded and based on experience, but presumptions nonetheless -- from witnesses including former US Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor, Alexander Vindman, a top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, and US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland.  But, first, that argument ignores firsthand evidence including, most importantly, the damning rough transcript of the July 25 call  between Trump and Zelensky in which Trump stated, ""I would like you to do us a favor though...""  Second, the ""no direct evidence"" claim underscores the need to hear from witnesses who would have firsthand knowledge of Trump's intent, including former national security adviser John Bolton and Mick Mulvaney, who heads the Office of Management and Budget and serves as Trump's chief of staff.    Trump's defense team made other arguments, too. Here's the lightning round: --They're trying to overturn the election: No, the Constitution provides for both elections and impeachment to remove corrupt officials from office --Schiff ran an unfair, secret process: No, the process afforded Trump ample due process --Trump was unfairly investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller and was cleared:  To the extent Mueller is even relevant at all here, he found that the Trump campaign welcomed, encouraged and ""expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts"" --What about the whistleblower? Irrelevant, and in any event, the whistleblower described Trump's July 25 call with Zelensky with remarkable accuracy.  Notably absent from Saturday's presentation were some of the more inflammatory, dramatic arguments that seem likely to spark the most controversy. We haven't seen appearances from constitutional lawyer Alan Dershowitz or former independent counsel Ken Starr yet. No laughable, disproven arguments that impeachment must be based on a statutory crime (though that likely will come when Dershowitz takes the podium) have been introduced so far. There haven't been any assaults on the Bidens (for now). Those fireworks may be coming on Monday and Tuesday, but for now the defense has kept its powder dry. For now.  "
186,CNN,"""For all their talk about election interference, they're here to perpetrate the most massive interference in an election in American history -- and we can't allow that to happen,"" said White House counsel Pat Cipollone, who is leading Trump's team. 2. There is no direct evidence of wrongdoing ""They think you can read minds, I look at the words,"" he said, after pointing out that neither Trump nor Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said there was pressure, despite Trump's request in the White House call transcript. Need for White House evidence Speaking after the arguments, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the defense arguments were proof the Senate trial should feature witnesses and subpoenas for documents. ""So the President's counsel is criticizing the case against the President for lack of sources close to the President while at the same time blocking testimony from witnesses close to the President,"" he said. ""It makes no sense.""  LISTEN: I went in-depth on Trump's defense and also the highlights from the end of Democrats' opening arguments on the Daily DC Impeachment Watch podcast. Will any senators actually flip on Trump impeachment? The current question is not whether Trump will be removed from office -- he won't. It's whether senators vote to hear from witnesses and see new evidence. I spent much of Friday going over which senators might flip -- from both parties. Democrats seem completely united. There is a small universe of Republicans to watch. And even they are complaining about this process. It could be a stretch for even four Republicans to support more information at this trial. See everyone here. Smart for Trump's team to go quickly The arguments lasted just about two hours. Cipollone, literally at the stroke of noon, said he was done for the day. The fact of their brevity was a theme Trump's lawyers continually mentioned. ""I am not going to continue to go over and over and over again the evidence that they did not put before you. Because we would be here for a lot longer than 24 hours,"" said Jay Sekulow, one of Trump's lead attorneys. 'If you're winning, shut up' Some supporters of impeachment praised the move, in part because Saturday morning is, as Trump has said, the Death Valley of ratings, but also as a sign of respect to senators itching to get out the door and smart, given the defense team's strategic position. ""If you take less time and make your point more crisply, that's probably better,"" said Preet Bharara, former US attorney for the Southern District of New York ""If you're winning, shut up,"" added lawyer Jeffrey Toobin on CNN. ""I think that's the guiding principal of what they're doing.""  Some flaws in the Trump defense There were some flaws in their arguments. For instance, deputy White House counsel Michael Purpura played several moments from impeachment hearings in which witnesses -- former US Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor, former special envoy for Ukraine Kurt Volker and former National Security Council staffer Tim Morrison -- said the first time they knew the Ukrainians expressed concern about security funding being frozen was in August. And all that testimony did occur. Purpura did not include the testimony of Laura Cooper, the Pentagon official who mentioned emails her office received from Ukrainians about the aid on the same day as Trump's phone call with the Ukrainian President. Nor did he mention documents that show Ukrainians concerned about the holdup in early August, reported on by The New York Times. Schiff turned into anti-Trump villain After days in which Rep. Adam Schiff, the House's lead impeachment manager and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, became a viral hero to supporters of impeachment, with his methodical arguments and passionate, urgent pleas to hold Trump accountable, he was given a new role by the President's defense team. His satirical paraphrasing of Trump's call with Zelensky, for which Trump and his defenders have routinely criticized Schiff, was played and the California Democrat was accused of being a liar. ""That's fake, that's not the real call,"" Purpua said after playing the moment. ""That's not the evidence here, that's not the transcript."" Purpura showed the clip from the acting DNI hearing, Schiff, the lead impeachment manager, looked at him and was watching along without expression, according to CNN's Manu Raju.  Read a fact check of that argument against Schiff here. Schiff tried to head that claim off during his arguments Friday. ""I discovered something very significant by mocking the President and that is for a man who loves to mock others, he does not like to be mocked. As it turns out, he's got a pretty thin skin. Who would have thought it?"" Schiff said, anticipating the line of questioning against him. ""Never mind that I said I wasn't using his words before I said, and I wasn't using his words after I said it, and I said I was making a parody of his words -- 'It's an outrage! He mocked the President, that Schiff! Terrible!'"" Trump's defense played multiple video clips of Schiff, not just from that hearing, but also from a cable news interview in which he said there was evidence of the Trump campaign colluding with Russia. The Trump defense disputed this point and said it was part of a pattern by Schiff, misrepresenting things. More Here's the audio of Trump telling Lev Parnas to get rid of US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. Pompeo fires back, on official letterhead, at a reporter who talked about his expletive-laced outburst at her when she asked Pompeo why he hasn't done more to defend Yovanovitch. When asked by CNN about the newly revealed ABC recording of Trump, Sen. Lindsey Graham downplayed its impact. ""No, I think the President had lost faith in her for reasons that are known to him, and I just don't think there's a problem,"" said the South Carolina Republican and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. And the Pentagon's vow to protect Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman against retaliation is being tested after Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee this week repeatedly attacked the decorated veteran. Point of order: Conviction does not automatically disqualify Trump in 2020 When Cipollone alleged that Democrats are asking Americans to ""remove President Trump from the ballot"" in the 2020, it wasn't technically correct. As CNN's Jamie Ehrlich pointed out to me earlier this week, Article 1 Section 3 of the Constitution holds that ""Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States."" It does not specify, however, whether those votes -- removal and disqualification -- should be held concurrently.  In our case, removal and disqualification are listed together in the articles of impeachment, which House Speaker Nancy Pelosi handed over to the Senate to vote on. The precedent shows, however, that the Senate has separated removal and disqualification when they have voted on federal judges and officials. In the past, removal has required a supermajority (67 votes) and disqualification only required a simple majority (51 votes).  For example, in 1913, US Circuit Judge Robert Archbald was removed from office by a super majority and then disqualified by a simple majority. In 1989, US District Judge Alcee L. Hastings was convicted by the Senate by a super majority but a vote on disqualification never happened, and eventually he won a seat in the US House of Representatives, where he currently serves and represents Florida. This opens the door to Trump being removed from office, yet he is able to run for reelection in the fall. It also opens up the possibility that the Senate bars him from running for office, but allows him to remain President.   This is just a point of order, however, since there are not currently anywhere near the 67 votes needed to convict Trump."
187,CNN,"In the memo of the call, Trump discusses US aid to Ukraine and how the relationship between the two countries was ""not reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine."" He then says he would like Zelensky ""to do us a favor though."" Trump goes on to discusses a conspiracy theory related to the 2016 election and later, a potential Ukrainian investigation into the Bidens.  At CNN, we start with the facts. Visit CNN's home for Facts First. The Trump administration has argued that the military aid was entirely separate and being held because of concerns about corruption in Ukraine. Purpura's point holds, as the transcript does not specifically outline an exchange of one for another, but Democrats argue a quid pro quo was implicit given Ukraine's dependence on the US.  Zelensky and Ukrainian officials say there was no pressure Purpura said ""President Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials have repeatedly said there was no quid pro quo or no pressure on them to review anything."" Facts First: Ukraine's president and foreign minister have made comments that bolster Trump's argument that he did not pressure Ukraine to investigate his opponents in order to receive US military aid. President Zelensky in particular has said, on several occasions, that he felt no pressure from Trump to investigate the Bidens or the 2016 election. In a joint press conference with Trump in late September, after the memo of the phone call was released by the White House,  Zelensky first said ""nobody pushed me"" while Trump was also saying ""there was no pressure.""  During an interview with Time magazine, Zelensky was asked to ""clarify this issue of quid pro quo."" ""Look, I never talked to the President from the position of a quid pro quo. That's not my thing,"" Zelensky said. Ukraine's foreign minister, Vadym Prystaiko, has also said Trump's July phone call with Zelensky was ""friendly"" and that ""I think there was no pressure."" Republicans have used these comments to support their argument that the President didn't pressure Zelensky into doing anything he didn't want to do. However, Democrats have claimed Zelensky's assertions may indicate the opposite.  House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerry Nadler described Zelensky's situation as ""he has a gun to his head. The gun is the fact that the President of the United States, upon whom he depends for military aid, for help in many different ways, has shown himself willing to withhold that aid based on what he says, based on what he's willing to play along with the President for his own personal political goals.""   Zelensky and his team also discussed the pressure they were already feeling to publicly launch investigations that would benefit Trump, according to a source familiar with discussions at the meeting which occurred two weeks after Zelensky and Trump spoke for the first time in April. Ukraine did not know about the hold on military aid Purpura claimed Ukraine did not know military aid was being withheld at the time of the phone call, so there could effectively be no quid pro quo between the parties. ""President Zelensky and high-ranking Ukrainian officials did not even know,"" Purpura argued, ""the security assistance was paused until the end of August, over a month after the July 25 call."" Facts First: It's unclear when exactly top Ukrainian government officials knew that nearly $400 million in military and security aid was being withheld. But there is evidence that some of them suspected there was an issue with the funding as early as July 25, the same day as President Trump's phone call with Zelensky. According to testimony from Laura Cooper, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, some members of her staff told her that they had received queries about the aid from Ukrainian officials on July 25. Cooper did not, however, know if the Ukrainian officials were aware of a hold on the aid or were just checking in. The New York Times reported that, according to Olena Zerkal, an ex-top official in Kiev, members of the Ukrainian government knew the aid was being held up at some point in late July, but Zerkal could not recall the exact date. As Purpura noted, the withholding of military aid was not brought up in meetings between Ukraine and US officials. It wasn't until Politico reported in late August that Trump was withholding military aid to Ukraine that top Zelensky adviser, Andrey Yermak, texted Kurt Volker, Trump's special envoy for Ukraine, with a link to the article and a message ""we need to talk.""  This could be due to the unusual process of how the aid was withheld. The Office of Management and Budget has declined to turn over documents to investigators related to the withholding of the aid. No witness testified the President acknowledged  The fourth key fact Purpura claimed was that ""not a single witness testified that the President himself said that there was any connection between any investigations and security assistance, a presidential meeting or anything else.""  Facts First: It's true witnesses did not testify the President said anything about a quid pro quo, but other administration officials have testified to the existence of one.  Gordon Sondland, the Trump-appointed US Ambassador to the European Union, made things even more explicit during his public testimony in November before the House Intelligence Committee. ""I know that members of this committee frequently frame these complicated issues in the form of a simple question,"" Sondland said. ""Was there a quid pro quo? As I testified previously, with regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting, the answer is yes."" Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney confirmed the existence of a quid pro quo but hours later denied he had admitted such a thing.  Ukraine never announced an investigation into Biden or the 2016 election  Aiming to make the case that Trump did not engage in a quid pro quo because the Ukrainians got what they wanted without ever announcing an investigation into the 2016 election or the Bidens, Purpura argued ""a presidential meeting took place on September 25 without the Ukrainian government announcing any investigations.""  Facts First: This is misleading. While an announcement of investigations never took place, it was planned and discussed between representatives of both the US and Ukraine. The plan was only halted after the withheld aid was released.  In November, the New York Times reported that Ukrainian President Zelensky had planned to announce an investigation into Trump's political rivals during a September interview on CNN. The Ukrainians canceled the interview and announcement once Trump released the promised security aid on September 12. During the July 25 call, Trump also suggested his personal attorney, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, be a point of contact, given that Giuliani had previously lobbied Ukraine to investigate Biden's call in 2016 to remove the country's top prosecutor.   During the conversation, Zelensky appeared to agree with the President's request. Zelensky said, ""The issue of the investigation of the case is actually the issue of making sure to restore the honesty so we will take care of that and will work on the investigation of the case."" Trump's track record on support for Ukraine Purpura argued that Trump has ""been a better friend and stronger supporter of Ukraine then his predecessor"" while Trump's lawyer Jay Sekulow noted that Trump, not Obama, took the ""concrete step"" of ""actually providing Ukraine with lethal weapons, including javelin missiles."" Facts First: This is true, the Trump administration did provide lethal aide to Ukraine while the Obama administration did not. President Barack Obama was criticized for his refusal to provide lethal assistance to Ukraine -- though it did provide more than $100 million in security assistance, as well as defense and military equipment. By March 2015, the US had committed more than $120 million in security assistance for Ukraine and had pledged an additional $75 million worth of equipment including UAVs, counter-mortar radars, night vision devices and medical supplies and armored Humvees according to the Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency. While it never provided lethal aid, some of the items that the Obama administration did provide were seen as critical to Ukraine's military. Part of the $250 million assistance package that the Trump administration announced (then froze and later unfroze) included many of the same items that were provided under Obama, including medical equipment, night vision gear and counter-artillery radar. The Trump administration, however, did approve the provision of arms to Ukraine, including sniper rifles, rocket launchers and Javelin anti-tank missiles, something long sought by Kiev. Legal team's defense of Trump raised factual questions  Did Trump really care about corruption in Ukraine? A centerpiece of President Trump's defense is that he was doing his job by asking Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden -- because he was actually pressing Ukraine to crack down on corruption. Purpura said Saturday, ""When it comes to sending US taxpayer money overseas, the President is focused on burden-sharing and corruption."" Facts First: Purpura is accurately describing the corruption situation in Ukraine, as described by many witnesses. But his other claims — that Trump sincerely cared about corruption and was acting in good faith to root it out — don't hold up. Full fact check here. Were European countries not contributing anything to Ukraine? The President has repeatedly claimed one of the reasons he withheld security assistance to Ukraine was to get other countries to contribute. In defense of the President, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone repeated false claims Trump has made about contributions from European countries to Ukraine, claiming that German Chancellor Angela Merkel ""talks Ukraine but she doesn't do anything. A lot of European countries are the same way.""  Facts First: Germany and France have both sent millions of euros to Ukraine, along with other European nations. Full fact check here. Was Trump locked out from participating in House impeachment proceedings? In his attempt to discredit the impeachment process run by House Democrats, Cipollone again falsely suggested that the President's team wasn't allowed to participate. ""If you were really confident in your position on the facts, why would you lock everybody out of it from the President's side? Why would you do that?"" Cipollone said. Facts first: This is false. House Democrats made a formal offer to the White House to have a lawyer present during their proceedings, but the offer was rejected in a politically-tinged letter from Cipollone himself. And Republicans were permitted to participate in closed-door deposition of witnesses during the investigation phase. Republican lawyers were also allowed to question witnesses during the House hearings.  Full fact check here. Did Schiff make up the contents of Trump's call with Zelensky? Moments into Trump's defense team's opening arguments, Purpura played a clip of Rep. Adam Schiff talking about the transcript of the July 25 call between President Trump and Ukraine's president.  After playing a clip of Schiff's comments, Purpura said, ""That's fake. That's not the real call. That's not the evidence here.  Facts First: It's true that Schiff gave a dramatized presentation of Trump's call with Zelensky. But Schiff clearly said beforehand that he was giving a dramatic reading, and never claimed that his version was the truth version of the call. Nonetheless, Trump has used this debacle to hammer away at Schiff and accuse him of ""fraud."" Full fact check here.  If the Senate votes to convict Trump, does it automatically disqualify him from holding public office? Cipollone alleged that Democrats are asking Americans to ""remove President Trump from the ballot"" in the 2020 election and ""tear up all of the ballots."" Facts First: If the Senate does vote to convict Trump, it does not automatically disqualify him from holding future public office. It would take an additional vote on that specific question to bar him from ever holding public office. Democrats however have said that Trump's actions do warrant disqualification.  Full fact check here. Was the whistleblower biased? President Trump's lawyer Patrick Philbin cherry-picked accusations of political bias against the Ukraine whistleblower today during the impeachment trial. ""The whistleblower, we know, from a letter that the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community sent, that he thought that the whistleblower had political bias,"" Philbin said Saturday morning on the Senate floor. Facts First: That's not the full story. Philbin picked the part that helps the President but ignored other relevant facts.  Full fact check here. Does Trump have a strong record on confronting Russia? Addressing Trump's relationship with Russia, Cipollone said ""President Trump has a strong record on confronting Russia.""

But these actions have been repeatedly undercut or undermined by President Trump's public comments, or other actions he's personally taken. Full fact check here."
188,CNN,"The novel, already being adapted into a movie, has become the latest flashpoint in a growing debate about representation, cultural appropriation and whether artists can -- or should -- tell stories about identities they don't know firsthand. It's an argument that's raged in response to music and movies, too -- remember when Jennifer Lopez sang Motown and Emma Stone played a character of Chinese and Hawaiian descent?  And now the debate has detonated yet again, thanks to a 392-page book with barbed wire criss-crossing its cover. A book party with barbed wire decorations Oprah's Book Club picks have a reputation for their hefty influence in the publishing industry. Winning the billionaire's blessing can send a book to the top of the bestseller list as adoring fans and avid readers scramble to get a copy.   It's been called ""the Oprah Effect."" Toni Morrison's books, for example, reportedly got more of a sales boost from Oprah's endorsements than from the author's Nobel Prize. That could happen for ""American Dirt,"" too. Amazon is already listing the book among its most popular titles.  Debate over ""American Dirt"" had already bubbled up before Oprah's announcement Tuesday. The book had garnered some rave reviews and praise from authors like Stephen King, Don Winslow and Sandra Cisneros, but also fierce criticism in some corners from reviewers who'd read it and some authors who vowed they never would.  But when Oprah blessed the book, the conversation kicked into overdrive. Critics accuse Cummins -- who reportedly got a seven-figure book deal for ""American Dirt"" after a bidding war between publishing houses -- of relying on stereotypes to paint an inauthentic picture of Mexican migrants, and exploiting trauma and pain for profit.  And their outrage grew this week as tweets surfaced showing the author celebrating the book at a dinner featuring floral centerpieces wrapped with barbed wire and sporting a manicure featuring the barbed wire design that's on her book cover. The author wrote that she 'wished someone slightly browner' would tell the story In an author's note included in the book, Cummins acknowledges she grappled with whether she should be the one to write it. ""I worried that my privilege would make me blind to certain truths, that I'd get things wrong, as I may well have. I worried that, as a nonmigrant and non-Mexican, I had no business writing a book set almost entirely in Mexico, set entirely among migrants. I wished someone slightly browner than me would write it,"" she says.  ""But then, I thought, If you're a person who has the capacity to be a bridge, why not be a bridge? So I began."" Cummins, who has described herself as white, also says in the note that her Puerto Rican grandmother's experience coming to the United States inspired her. She describes her research for ""American Dirt"" as ""careful and deliberate."" ""I traveled extensively on both sides of the border and learned as much as I could about Mexico and migrants, about people living throughout the borderlands,"" she writes. A mounting chorus of criticism on Twitter argues that the book's portrayals are inaccurate -- and that plenty of writers of color have told compelling stories about Mexico, migration and the border, but didn't win such a huge book deal or such acclaim from the publishing industry, which is dominated by whites. For its part, Flatiron Books says it's proud to be the publisher of ""American Dirt"" -- and listening to the debate. ""The concerns that have been raised including the question of who gets to tell which stories are valid ones in relation to literature and we welcome that conversation,"" the publisher said in a statement posted on Twitter Thursday. The book, according to the publisher, ""gives us empathy with our fellow human beings"" as it answers the question, ""How far will a mother go to protect her son?"" ""This is the lens through which we have viewed 'American Dirt' as the publisher, and the way in which we hope it can be appreciated by readers,"" Flatiron says. Cummins addressed the controversy at an event in Baltimore this week, again describing how she'd wrestled with whether to write ""American Dirt"" and ultimately decided it would be ""cowardice"" not to. The book, she said, ""needs to stand on its own merits.""  ""I think this is an important conversation. I feel like it is a question that needs to be directed more firmly toward publishers than at individual writers. I was never going to turn down money that someone offered me for something that took me seven years to write,"" she said, according to a transcript of her remarks. ""I acknowledge that there is tremendous inequity in the industry, about who gets attention for writing what books . . . I'm aware that in the court of public opinion on my ethnicity at this point I am the white lady. I am also Puerto Rican. I am a Latinx woman. And I'm not a migrant,"" she continued.  ""But I feel like putting that so central to the conversation makes me—I'm in such an uncomfortable position about how to identify myself and how to account for things that are beyond my reckoning."" The questions 'American Dirt' is raising go way beyond this book While there's no doubt that ""American Dirt"" itself has touched off a fierce debate that's showing no signs of slowing, it's also part of a much bigger conversation. Ana-Christina Ramón says she sees a clear connection with her own work. As the director of research and civic engagement for UCLA's social sciences division and the co-author of an annual report on diversity in Hollywood, she closely tracks what stories are being told on TV and the big screen -- and who's telling them. The debate over ""American Dirt,"" she says, has a familiar ring. ""Especially for the Latino community, in film and TV we don't really get enough of a chance to show our authentic lives,"" says Ramón, who has not read ""American Dirt"" but says she read numerous reviews and analyses of the book by people she trusts. ""Then, to see that in literature it's kind of the same, it's frustrating."" And the consequences, she says, can be devastating. ""When a privileged few get to tell stories and distribute them widely, they shape the narrative for themselves and for others,"" she wrote on Twitter.  It's something Lori Flores encounters every time she starts a new semester. The associate professor of history at Stony Brook University says she begins every course she teaches about the US-Mexico border or immigration by asking students what words come to mind when they think of those things. And the answers can be discouraging. ""Every time I do that, it's words like 'drugs,' 'violence,' 'danger,' 'economic threats.' It's both illuminating and frustrating that every term, I start all over again, to get people to realize that migration happens for many reasons and migrants look all sorts of ways,"" she says. ""Unfortunately, this book, what it's illuminating for people, we keep on getting the same trope of a victim migrant fleeing a drug- and corruption-ridden Mexico. ... It erases all of the other rich, complicated, diverse stories of Latin Americans, migrants of all kinds. ... It erases all the work that those of us trying to educate the public are trying to do. I think that's what hitting a big nerve for people. They're frustrated and they're tired of the struggle having to repeat itself every day."" Flores said she wouldn't buy the book based on what she's read about it, but she isn't ruling out checking out a copy from the library and using it as a teaching tool. ""It certainly can be,"" she says, ""because it makes us think about what's problematic in the story, and what's problematic in the publishing industry."" A teacher says authors should 'write the other' but do it well Nisi Shawl says the takeaway from the ""American Dirt"" debate shouldn't be that authors can't write about experiences they haven't lived. In fact, Shawl, who's cowritten a book called ""Writing the Other"" and also teaches classes on that topic, says it's something every author needs to be able to do.  ""In any kind of fiction, you're building a world. If you're trying to do that realistically, then you are not just representing people who are actually demographically like yourself. You need to be able to do that,"" they say. ""It is a skill that writers need. ""It's just that you can do it well, or you can do it poorly,"" they say. ""And by all accounts, (in 'American Dirt') this has been done poorly.""  There are common missteps that writers make, Shawl says, and relying on stereotypes and clichés is one of them. ""They're going not by what they've experienced, but they're filtering it through a TV show or a book or a cartoon, or something else,"" says Shawl, who learned about ""American Dirt"" from a student and hasn't read it yet. But it's possible to learn from mistakes -- something Shawl hopes the book's author will do. ""I think that you do have to expect that you will get it wrong at least part of the time,"" Shawl says. ""But you can learn how to get it better."""
189,CNN,"Democrats have said they believe the Senate should call witnesses in the trial. Republicans have said that they are willing to hear from people who didn't testify in the House proceedings last fall -- like former national security adviser John Bolton -- if they can hear from former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, whose position on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company is at the heart of GOP conspiracy theories concerning Ukraine. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden. (Revisit that history here.) Rather than gloss over the fact that Trump was pushing Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, Democrats went on offense Thursday, repeatedly mentioning Hunter Biden's position on the Burisma board. Impeachment managers argued that Biden went after the Ukrainian prosecutor for ignoring corruption, the opposite of the storyline Trump and his allies have pushed. But Trump attorney Jay Sekulow said the focus on Biden ""opened the door"" for the President's defense team to discuss Joe Biden and Burisma: ""For the last five hours, it's been a lot about Joe Biden and Burisma, they kind of opened the door for that response so we'll determine as a defense team the appropriate way to do it."" We'll see when the defense opens on Saturday how this plays out. They are using Trump's allies against him In another methodical day of arguments, the Democratic House impeachment managers laid out the constitutional argument that abuse of power -- the first of the two articles faced by President Donald Trump -- is an impeachable offense. They cited Alexander Hamilton but they also brought in some guest footage -- of Trump's most ardent defenders. Democrats played 21-year-old video of South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham arguing during the impeachment trial of Bill Clinton, back when he felt impeachment can move ahead even if there hasn't been a criminal offense. ""Acting in a way that hurts people, you've committed a high crime,"" Graham said then. He had just left the Senate chamber when that clip was played on Thursday. Democrats, who are in the role of prosecutors, played similar video of lawyer Alan Dershowitz, who is a member of Trump's legal team today. Later, making the case that Trump pushed Russian propaganda that Ukraine opposed him in 2016, they played devastating video of a former top security aide, Tom Bossert, appearing on ABC News and of FBI director Christopher Wray making a similar point.  They portrayed 'America's Mayor' Rudy Giuliani as 'the President's political bag man' During multiple presentations, Democrats, including Florida Rep. Val Demings and New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, made a villain of Giuliani. They flashed emails they obtained from the US ambassador to the European Union showing Giuliani's impact on US policy. They dove into phone records -- obtained despite White House efforts to keep documents from the impeachment inquiry -- that showed his interactions with the White House at key moments. Giuliani himself featured prominently during the day, as video of his media appearances pushing the Biden conspiracy theory played against the backdrop of Trump's efforts to insert his personal lawyer into US foreign policy -- with the goal of obtaining the political investigations he sought from Ukraine. Jeffries at one point called Giuliani, who is still Trump's attorney -- although not on his impeachment defense team -- as Trump's ""bag man."" Giuliani, for his part, said on Twitter he'll be launching a new podcast Friday to push information he has on Ukraine. He also lashed out at his former associate Lev Parnas, the indicted Soviet-born businessman who gave documents to House investigators implicating Giuliani. A helpful read from last September, by CNN's Mike Warren: How Giuliani wound up here.  They brought up evidence that came out after the House vote -- and made fresh allegations As we pointed out last week, Americans have learned a lot of things since the December 18 House impeachment vote. Demings and California Rep. Zoe Lofgren brought up some of it Thursday in their arguments.  Lofgren pointed to evidence provided after the House voted to impeach Trump that suggested that former US Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch was recalled from Ukraine in part in exchange for evidence of payments from Burisma to Hunter Biden. Lofgren called this a ""new quid pro quo."" (Reminder: Allies of Trump wanted to surveil Yovanovitch.)     Later, Demings made clear that Democrats have learned that a mysterious ""-1"" phone number that contacted Giuliani originated at the White House. Much of this is designed to whet the public's appetite for evidence the White House has been successful in blocking from investigators. They accused Trump of working for himself, not the country Democrats worked hard to draw a distinction between the national interest and Trump's, and they repeatedly came back to the idea that Trump abused power because he and Giuliani were working for him and not for the public. ""The only person who stood to benefit from the abuse of office and solicitation of these investigations was Donald Trump. The 45th President of the United States. A violation of public trust. A failure to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. But when it came down to choosing between the national interest of the country and his own personal interests, his reelection, President Trump chose himself,"" said Demings.  Republicans are finding new reasons to oppose trial witnesses While Trump tweeted to the public about the idea of a witness trade -- a Democratic witness, say, for a Republican one, like Hunter Biden -- it is his threat to block testimony by John Bolton that has some Republicans leaning against witnesses. Threat of court battle as a reason to oppose subpoenas CNN's Manu Raju and Jeremy Herb report GOP senators are moving in the opposite direction. They're privately and publicly raising concerns that issuing subpoenas -- to top officials like acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser Bolton and for documents blocked by the White House -- will only serve to drag out the proceedings. Plus, many say there's little appetite for such a time-consuming fight, given that legal battles may ultimately not be successful and could force the courts to rule on hugely consequential constitutional issues about the separation of powers between the branches of government. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska moderate in the caucus, questioned the House Democrats' decision to skip the courts because they wanted to avoid a drawn-out legal battle. ""The House made a decision that they didn't want to slow things down by having to go through the courts,"" Murkowski told CNN. ""And yet now they're basically saying you guys gotta go through the courts. We didn't, but we need you to."" Flawed logic Chief CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin called out this line of thinking, saying it was absurd and outrageous. ""In other words, the Republican position is you can't investigate the President for obstruction of justice because he is still obstructing justice. The whole point of the second article of impeachment is that he is using his powers to stop an investigation. And what they are saying, well, he is still doing it so I guess we better throw in the towel.""  John Bolton and executive privilege Meanwhile, there is an open question about Bolton, who has offered to testify if subpoenaed. If Trump tries to exert privilege over Bolton, will he rescind the offer? Bolton is writing a book, by the way, so he's prepared to publish what he knows. Shouldn't he be able to tell Congress? Trump could test that idea. The Democratic view is that Bolton is now a private citizen. ""Executive privilege cannot be used to prevent a witness who is willing to testify from appearing, and certainly not one who no longer works in government. It's not a gag order. And witnesses testify on national security all the time. Bolton has a right to testify if he wants to,"" Lofgren said on Twitter. And Republicans are holding the line  ""It's not really changing our opinion,"" Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst said after the party lunch Thursday, referring to how Republicans feel about the House managers' case so far. Ernst also added, ""I think we're still waiting to see the overwhelming evidence and once we see that maybe it will convince us that more information is needed, or not. We don't know, because I haven't had that presented yet.""  One Republican questioned Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman's patriotism Vindman is the NSC official who raised concerns at the White House about pressure on the Ukrainians in real time as it was happening. He testified on Capitol Hill while wearing his military uniform. Here's his story.  But Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn questioned his credibility and patriotism after video of his testimony was played in the Senate chamber Thursday. ""Adam Schiff is hailing Alexander Vindman as an American patriot. How patriotic is it to badmouth and ridicule our great nation in front of Russia, America's greatest enemy?"" she said on Twitter of the Purple Heart winner and Iraq war veteran. ""That a member of the Senate -- at a moment when the Senate is undertaking its most solemn responsibility -- would choose to take to Twitter to spread slander about a member of the military is a testament to cowardice,"" said Vindman's lawyer, Amb. David Pressman, in a tweet of his own. ""While Senator Blackburn fires off defamatory tweets, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman will continue to do what he has always done: serve our country dutifully and with honor."" We're all in something of a Catch-22  The issue of new witnesses and evidence has become circular and maddening. Democrats argue there must be new subpoenas for new evidence the White House has withheld and witnesses that have been blocked in order for the trial to be fair. They dismiss the idea that this would lead to a protracted legal fight since, with John Roberts in the chamber and able to offer guidance, they would sail through the courts. Republicans say the Senate shouldn't have to be dealing with this issue. The House didn't deal with it either. They just impeached Trump. Regardless of whether they had the goods to impeach when they did -- clearly Democrats felt they had a solid case -- it is beyond dispute that there is unknown information that could be gotten by subpoena. Republicans, however, have no interest in getting it. Steve Scalise, the House minority whip, summed it up pretty well on Twitter: ""So let's get this straight... First Dems claimed they proved their case beyond any doubt in the House. Then Dems wrote in their impeachment brief that they have 'overwhelming' evidence. But now they say they need more witnesses to make their case?? America isn't buying this."" How exactly America feels will be known next November, when voters weigh in on Democrats, who said they had no choice but to impeach a President that Republicans were always going to be able to acquit. Trump broke his own Twitter record Chris Cillizza noted that Trump tweeted more Wednesday than he's ever tweeted in a single day -- and came to this conclusion: ""It's difficult to see the volume of Trump's tweets and retweets -- on the day that the House impeachment managers lay out the case against him -- and not conclude that he is worried. ""Now, maybe he isn't worried about being removed from office. (There is little evidence that there are 67 senators willing to vote to do so.) But Trump's Twitter frenzy does suggest that he is concerned about the the narrative of the impeachment trial turning against him -- and what it might mean for his reelection chances.""

190,CNN,"The Trump tapes not only break up hours of dense legal arguments. They also put the President at the center of the action, portraying him as the ringleader of the scheme to pressure Ukraine for political favors, and not an outsider player. They also confront the Republican senators, serving as jurors, with the direct evidence of what Democrats say is outlandish, impeachable behavior in a way that may not change their minds but is deeply uncomfortable. Driving home the case for new witnesses, currently being thwarted by GOP senators in multiple votes, Schiff turned to a clip of Trump on December 3. ""When it's fair, and it will be fair in the Senate, I would love to have Mike Pompeo, I'd love to have Mick (Mulvaney), I'd love to have Rick Perry and many other people testify,"" the President said at the time, taking a position at odds with the current arguments of his legal team and Republican Senate leaders. On Wednesday, Democrats wanted to establish a pattern of behavior on Trump's part of soliciting foreign interference in US elections, as he is alleged to have done in a quid pro quo in Ukraine, as they seek to prove corrupt intent. So Schiff dug out the famous clip from the 2016 election when Trump called on Russia, ""if you are listening,"" to find Hillary Clinton's 30,000 ""missing"" emails. Last year's call by the President for China to ""start an investigation into the Bidens"" also came up, as did Trump's comment to George Stephanopoulos on ABC News that if a foreign power had election dirt: ""I think I'd want to hear it."" As that last clip echoed through the chamber, impeachment manager Rep. Sylvia Garcia, D-Texas, bemoaned the ""shocking video"" to underline the point. Every time Trump's unmistakable tones started reverberating through the chamber, the heads of senators snapped toward the screens showing the clips. The President's lawyers argue that he did nothing wrong in Ukraine, that he acted within his powers and that the Democratic case that he abused his power is ""ridiculous"" and unconstitutional. Trump contradicts his own case The flurry of video underscored how Trump's torrent of verbiage often contains comments that hurt his own interests, come back to haunt him or even appear to openly reveal malfeasant behavior. After all, this is the President who fired FBI Director James Comey in 2017 and then went on NBC News and said his shock move had been motivated by the Russia investigation. The clips of Trump's remarks also help shed light on how he manages to so often skip free after behaving in a way that might have downed his predecessors: He does it all in public.  Had Trump's comments on getting election dirt emerged on a secret tape, Richard Nixon-style, they would seem so much more damaging. As House impeachment manager Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York, said Wednesday when dealing with a rough transcript that shows the President putting pressure on his Ukrainian counterpart: ""The evidence of wrongdoing by President Trump is hiding in plain sight."" In the internal drama playing out in the Senate, Trump's greatest hits are being used by Democrats to suggest that his alleged abuse of power -- seeking political dirt from Ukraine on his potential 2020 opponent Joe Biden -- is not an isolated act but conduct in keeping with his character. The videos also add credibility to a case that Republican senators, almost all of whom are expected to vote to acquit the President, are being faced to hear in relentless, repetitive and incriminating detail. Some of it may even be new to them or may contradict their GOP talking points. And Democratic opponents in November know it will be much harder for them to plead ignorance of what the President was up to. ""I think it's painful for them to keep hearing how the President shook down the President of another country ... but you know what, this is forcing them to face it. If they turn off their ears, I am really sad for our country,"" Hawaii's Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono said on CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" There are few signs, however, that the hours of testimony, also punctuated by clips of other witnesses who took part in House impeachment hearings and are highly critical of the President, are changing the minds of Republicans, who have insurmountable political incentives to acquit Trump. North Dakota's Sen. Kevin Cramer appeared to be laughing during two clips played by Garcia, including one featuring Trump. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a friend and political ally of the President's, wore a big smile when Schiff played the clip of Trump urging Russia to find the missing emails. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas was asked by CNN's Ted Barrett whether he was concerned by anything that the President was depicted as saying. ""That's really not the question,"" Cornyn replied. ""The question is whether this is treason, bribery or another high crime and misdemeanor. I mean, this is the nuclear option under our Constitution to remove a duly elected president by the vote of the House and the Senate,"" he said. ""This is something we should not do unless that constitutional standard is met, and I'm struggling to see how that is even close."" Conservative commentator Scott Jennings said on CNN that even if some GOP senators were upset by the evidence of Trump's behavior they were forced to watch, they had little realistic choice about what to do. Such senators were asking, ""Are we really going to throw a president out of office for the first time in American history over this?"" Jennings told Burnett. Back to pushing for witnesses  On the first day of the trial, Democrats made repeated attempts to get Republicans on the record as opposing the admission of witnesses such as former national security adviser John Bolton and White House acting chief of staff Mulvaney as they seek to show the GOP is thwarting a fair trial. If the public comes to believe their narrative, it will be harder for the President to claim vindication following his likely acquittal. But on the Rumsfeldian principle that you go to the war with the witnesses you have rather than those you wished you had, they featured clips from multiple current and former diplomatic officials testifying in the House impeachment inquiry. By repeatedly turning to footage of former White House senior Russia adviser Fiona Hill, who described how Trump's men carried out political errands in Ukraine, Democrats hinted at a broader point about the need for more witnesses in the trial -- a showdown that will take place after both sides have presented their cases. Hill gave the most graphic testimony in the House inquiry about how Bolton had called Rudy Giuliani's off-the-books diplomatic initiative in Ukraine a ""drug deal"" and the President's personal lawyer a ""hand grenade."" That begs the question of Republican senators: Shouldn't they hear what Bolton has to say for himself? Democrats also showed footage of ousted US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch admitting that she was intimidated by Trump's tweets attacking her. While the President was all over the trial, his legal team apparently has no desire to see the commander in chief in person at their table in the well of the Senate. ""His counsel might recommend against that. That's not the way it works,"" Trump attorney Jay Sekulow told reporters. ""Presidents don't do that."""

192,CNN,"OK, so a few thoughts here. Trump's articulation of his admiration for Tesla founder (and space enthusiast) Elon Musk goes like this: ""I spoke to him very recently, and he's also doing the rockets. He likes rockets. And-- he does good at rockets too, by the way."" So, he ""does good at the rockets,"" you say? Musk's company -- SpaceX -- has set a goal of building a ""self-sustaining"" civilization on Mars or, put another way, ""he likes rockets."" Then there's Trump's insistence that Musk is ""one of our great geniuses"" and, as such, must be protected. Just like we protect Thomas Edison. Who died in 1931. But who, in case you had forgotten ""came up with originally the light bulb."" (Yup, that checks out.)  So far, so good! Then, there is this coup de grace from Trump: Not only do we need to protect geniuses like Musk (alive!) and Edison (not alive!), we also need to protect the person who invented the wheel. The wheel was invented by the ancient Mesopotamians about 5,500 years ago. So, that one wasn't an American invention. But we still need to protect it/them! The point here is that, well, Trump appears to have no idea what he is talking about. Whether that's because he is simply inarticulate or he really believes a) Thomas Edison still currently needs to be protected and b) America invented the wheel, we may never know."
193,CNN,"Trump said at the press conference that he released the rough transcript of his July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky after House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, the Democrats' lead impeachment manager, gave an erroneous account of the call at a committee meeting: ""He had no idea that I was going to release the transcript. He never thought I'd do that.""  At CNN, we start with the facts. Visit CNN's home for Facts First. Facts First: Trump released the rough transcript before Schiff gave his exaggerated rendition of the call, not after. Trump's initial complaint was that Schiff had ignored the available transcript; he then began reversing the timeline of events.  The Democrats, Schiff and the transcript  Trump said at the press conference: ""But they never thought we were going to release it. When we released that conversation, all hell broke out with the Democrats, because they say, 'Wait a minute. This is much different than Shifty Schiff told us.'""  Facts First: No Schiff-related dissension broke out among Democrats when Trump released the rough transcript. Again, Trump disclosed the document before Schiff made his comments. The second whistleblower Trump said at the press conference: ""There was supposed to be a second whistleblower. What happened to him? ...There was supposed to be an informer. What happened to the informer? All of these people disappeared. And when they saw this transcript, they said, 'We got problems.'""  Facts First: There is no evidence anyone has ""disappeared"" or said ""we got problems"" upon seeing the rough transcript -- which overwhelmingly corroborated the allegations of the first whistleblower. According to the second whistleblower's lawyer, that person never planned to file a separate complaint, only to provide corroborating information to support the first complaint. Whistleblowers have no obligation to speak publicly, and them not doing so doesn't mean they ""disappeared."" The call with Zelensky Trump said at the press conference that ""nobody talks about"" his call with Zelensky because it was so perfect. ""I never see them talking about the transcription. I never see them talking about the call, because there's nothing to say,"" he said. Similarly, he told CNBC, ""You notice they don't mention the calls, though. They never mention the calls. They talk about everything but the calls.""  Facts First: Democrats are still talking about the controversial July call, during Trump's impeachment trial and in other public forums. They did so extensively at the trial on Wednesday day. The timing of US aid to Ukraine At the press conference, Trump said that aid to Ukraine was delivered even sooner than it was scheduled to be: ""Now, here's the other thing: They got their money long before schedule. They got all their money."" He said on CNBC: ""So they got the money. In fact, they got it very early.""  Facts First: The money did not come early or ahead of schedule. Trump's freeze on the aid meant that $35 million could not get out the door before a legal deadline of the end of September, forcing Congress to pass a deadline extension.  Obama's aid to Ukraine Trump said on CNBC of Obama-era aid to Ukraine: ""President Obama gave them nothing. He gave them pillows and sheets and things like that, and I gave them tank busters.""  Facts First: While Obama, unlike Trump, did refuse to provide lethal assistance to Ukraine, Obama sent Ukraine much more than pillows and sheets; his military aid included drones, armored Humvees, counter-mortar radars, night vision devices and medical supplies. You can read a full fact check of this claim here.  European aid to Ukraine At the press conference, Trump repeated his claim that the US is the only country providing aid to Ukraine: ""Why isn't Germany paying? Why isn't UK paying? Why isn't France paying? Why aren't the European nations paying? Why is it always the sucker -- United States?""  He said nearly the same thing on Fox Business: ""Why isn't Germany and France and UK and all these other countries in Europe that are much more affected than us, why aren't they paying something?""  Facts First: European countries, including France and Germany, have provided at least hundreds of millions of dollars worth of assistance to Ukraine since Russia's invasion in 2014. You can read a full fact check here. Funding for NATO Trump said on Fox Business: ""You look at what I did with NATO: $530 billion more.""  Facts First: Trump's math was off. NATO has announced that it expects non-US member countries to add $400 billion to their defense budgets, over 2016 levels, by 2024. Regardless of how much credit Trump deserves for the increase, he was inaccurately adding an initial $130 billion increase that is part of, not in addition to, the expected $400 billion.  Rep. Al Green's comments Trump said at the press conference that Democratic Rep. Al Green has said, ""We got to beat him by impeachment because we can't beat him in the election."" He said on Fox Business: ""I saw this guy, Green, he said, 'We have to impeach him because we can't beat him.' He said, 'We can't beat him, we have to impeach him.'""  Facts First: Trump was at least slightly exaggerating Green's comments. In May, Green said this: ""I'm concerned that if we don't impeach this President, he will get reelected."" In September, when Trump previously claimed Green had said ""we can't"" beat Trump without impeachment, Green told CNN, ""I never said we can't beat the President."""
194,CNN,"Facts First: This is false. As Schiff noted in his response to Cipollone, the 48 Republican members of the three committees holding the closed-door hearings -- Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight -- were allowed into the SCIF, and they were given equal time to question witnesses. At CNN, we start with the facts. Visit CNN's home for Facts First. Cipollone might have been referring to an October stunt in which Republicans who were not members of any of the three committees, along with some Republicans who were members, stormed the room to make a political point; the non-members were not allowed to be there, and they eventually left after causing a delay. But the Republicans who were members were allowed to be full participants in the proceedings. Schiff said he would not suggest ""Mr. Cipollone would deliberately make a false statement,"" but he said, ""I will tell you this: He's mistaken. He's mistaken."" He added that Republicans were not only allowed in but ""more than that: they got the same time we did."" The articles of impeachment Cipollone claimed that Democrats withheld the articles of impeachment for more than a month. ""They held these articles for 33 days,"" he said. Trump lawyers Patrick Philbin and Jay Sekulow used the same ""33 days"" figure -- Sekulow repeatedly. ""Thirty-three days -- 33 days, they held onto those impeachment articles -- 33 days. It was such a rush of national security that -- impeach this president before Christmas that they then held them for 33 days,"" Sekulow said. Facts First: While House Democrats did wait before they transmitted the articles of impeachment, they took 28 days, not 33. The House voted to impeach Trump on December 18, Democrats sent over the articles on January 15. The House Judiciary Committee  Sekulow alleged that Trump's constitutional rights were violated by the House Judiciary Committee. ""During the proceedings that took place before the Judiciary Committee, the President was denied the right to cross-examine witnesses, the President was denied the right to access evidence, and the President was denied the right to have counsel present at hearings,"" he said. Facts First: This is false. The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Jerry Nadler, formally invited Trump to have a lawyer participate in the proceedings in that committee -- but Cipollone declined the offer, saying in a letter to Nadler that ""an invitation to an academic discussion with law professors does not begin to provide the President with any semblance of a fair process.""  Regardless, Sekulow was wrong when he continued that not having the President's lawyer question witnesses in a House impeachment hearing ""violates the Constitution of the United States.""  Sekulow might perhaps have made an inadvertent error when he named the Judiciary Committee. Trump was indeed denied the right to have his own counsel participate in the preceding House Intelligence Committee hearings, during which the fact witnesses testified. (A lawyer for House Republicans, Steve Castor, was permitted to question witnesses at the House Intelligence Committee.) The constitutional rights of criminal defendants, such as the right to have the assistance of counsel and to call and confront witnesses, do not apply to the subjects of House proceedings. The Sixth Amendment, which grants these rights to criminal defendants, begins, ""In all criminal prosecutions...""  The timing of the military aid to Ukraine  Cipollone said that the military aid to Ukraine was still delivered ""on time"": ""Only in Washington would someone say that it's wrong when you don't spend taxpayer dollars fast enough, even if you spend them on time."" Facts First: It's not true that the entire aid package to Ukraine was ""on time."" While Trump did lift his freeze on the aid on September 11, more than two weeks before a September 30 legal deadline, the delay caused by Trump's freeze meant that $35 million of the aid could not make it out the door fast enough to meet the deadline, according to impeachment testimony from Mark Sandy, deputy associate director for national security in the Office of Management and Budget.  To deal with this problem, Congress had to pass an extension of the deadline. ""Had that provision not been included, then any unobligated funds as of September 30th would have expired,"" Sandy testified. The Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan watchdog agency that works for Congress, concluded that the aid freeze broke a law, the Impoundment Control Act.   The Zelensky call and the aid Michael Purpura, deputy White House counsel, said of Trump's July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky: ""There was no quid pro quo for anything. Security assistance funds aren't even mentioned on the call."" Facts First: This is misleading. The rough transcript shows that while Zelensky did not bring up the security assistance funds in particular, he did raise Ukraine's desire to buy more Javelin anti-tank missiles -- which were not part of the delayed security assistance package on which the impeachment proceedings have been centered, but were clearly important to Ukraine.  Trump immediately responded, ""I would like you to do us a favor though,"" then asked Zelensky to look into a debunked conspiracy theory about Democratic computer servers. Later in the call, Trump asked Zelensky to look into the Bidens. In October, Trump's State Department announced that it had approved the possible sale of 150 Javelins, worth $39 million, to Ukraine.  Mueller and obstruction Sekulow said: ""And then we had the invocation of the ghost of the Mueller Report, I know something about that report -- it came up empty on the issue of collusion with Russia. There was no obstruction, in fact, the Mueller Report, to the contrary of what these managers say today -- came to the exact opposite conclusions of what they say."" Facts First: Sekulow's wording was too vague for us to declare his claim false, but special counsel Robert Mueller's report on the Trump campaign's relationship with Russia did not come to a conclusion of ""no obstruction,"" nor did it say ""the opposite"" of Democrats' claims that Trump did commit obstruction. Mueller laid out multiple instances in which Trump may have committed obstruction, but he explained that he would abide by a Justice Department policy that holds that a sitting president cannot be indicted.  The report said: ""...If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that judgment. Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him."" Attorney General William Barr then determined that the evidence laid out by Mueller was ""not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense."" "
195,CNN,"None of this is by accident, of course. California's Speaker Nancy Pelosi named Schiff the chairman of the committee in 2015 -- a decision reflective of their close and long-standing relationship. (Pelosi herself once served as the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee.) That relationship goes back at least two decades; Pelosi was involved in raising money for Schiff's 2000 race, in which he defeated Republican Rep. Jim Rogan, who, wait for it, had been a House impeachment manager in the Senate trial of Bill Clinton. ""Speaker Pelosi has tremendous respect for him and trust in him,"" fellow Californian Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna told the San Francisco Chronicle of Schiff last fall. ""She respects his intellect, she respects how he presents himself on television, she respects his judgment. ... They have a very close bond."" That relationship stands in stark contrast to Pelosi's behind-the-scenes clashes with Nadler over impeachment. Pelosi was not so secretly unhappy with the aggressiveness of Nadler's Judiciary Committee in terms of seeking Trump's impeachment. As Politico wrote last fall: ""Both Pelosi and Nadler, who have served in the House together for more than 25 years, insist their relationship remains strong. But their rift over impeachment is getting harder and harder to paper over amid Democrats' flailing messaging on the topic and a growing divide in the caucus."" As the impeachment drama unfolded in the House, it became clear that Nadler was being sidelined in favor of Schiff -- at least somewhat. And Pelosi's decision to name Schiff as the lead impeachment manager -- the tip of the spear, as it were -- is also indicative of who she trusts to best handle this hugely delicate matter. In the main, Schiff has rewarded Pelosi's trust. His one misstep was in his somewhat dramatic reading of the White House transcript of a July 25, 2019, phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.  Trump immediately seized on Schiff's description of the call. ""Rep. Adam Schiff illegally made up a FAKE & terrible statement, pretended it to be mine as the most important part of my call to the Ukrainian President, and read it aloud to Congress and the American people,"" tweeted Trump in September. ""It bore NO relationship to what I said on the call. Arrest for Treason?"" (Worth noting: As I wrote at the time, this controversy is a tempest in a teapot. Before paraphrasing Trump's call, Schiff says this: ""In not so many words, this is the essence of what the President communicates"" -- making clear he is not directly reciting from the transcript.) Schiff has emerged as one of Trump's favorite figures for ridicule. According to the invaluable Trump Twitter Archive, the President has tweeted (or retweeted) about Schiff more than 300 times since 2017. ""Why did Nervous Nancy allow corrupt politician Shifty Schiff to lie before Congress?"" Trump tweeted earlier this month. ""He must be a Witness, and so should she!"" In spite of Trump's attacks -- or maybe, at least in part, because of them -- Schiff has been given more and more responsibility to carry the case against the President to not only the Senate but the country as well.  And if the opening hours of the Senate trial are any indication, we are going to be seeing a lot more of Schiff in the days and weeks(?) to come."

197,CNN,"""The McConnell rules seem to be designed by President Trump for President Trump. It asks the Senate to rush through as fast as possible and makes getting evidence as hard as possible,"" Schumer said on the Senate floor Tuesday. ""The McConnell resolution will result in a rushed trial with little evidence in the dark of night."" The debate over the trial rules played out after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell decided to alter the trial resolution shortly before it gaveled in Tuesday, amid concerns from key Senate Republicans and an uproar from Democrats. The new resolution will give the House impeachment managers and the President's team three days each to make their 24 hours of trial arguments, instead of two as McConnell had initially proposed. There were also changes to the section of the resolution that would not have admitted the House's evidence without a vote — now, evidence will be admitted automatically unless there is a motion from the President's team to throw out evidence. But the changes did little to satisfy Democrats in either chamber, who have accused McConnell and Senate Republicans of working with the President to rush through the impeachment trial. Democrats erupted when McConnell's four-page organizing resolution was released Monday night, dividing 24 hours over two days for opening arguments, delaying the question of witnesses until after the arguments were completed and requiring a vote for the House evidence to be submitted. Despite the changes, Democrats on Tuesday pushed for the Senate to obtain documents and witness testimony at the outset. ""If the Senate votes to deprive itself of witnesses and documents, the opening statements will be the end of the trial,"" House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, the lead impeachment manager and a California Democrat, said during the trial debate Tuesday, ""So to say, 'Let's just have the opening statements and then we'll see,' means let's have the trial, and maybe we can just sweep this all under the rug."" Two GOP aides said the changes McConnell made were the result of concerns from moderate Republicans. The alterations were hand-written into the resolution — a sign they were hastily put together before the trial began early Tuesday afternoon. Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and other colleagues ""raised concerns about the 24 hours of opening statements in two days and the admission of the House transcript is the record,"" Annie Clark, a Collins spokeswoman, told CNN. ""Her position has been that the trial should follow the Clinton model as much as possible. She thinks these changes are a significant improvement."" Collins did break with Republicans on one amendment vote, joining with Democrats on the 10th amendment to allow the sides 24 hours to respond to the trial motions that are due Wednesday morning. It failed 52-48. The move is a sign of how closely McConnell, who cannot afford to lose more than four GOP senators to keep control of the trial, is keeping the pulse of the moderates in his conference. Schumer's amendments sought subpoenas for a host of documents related to Ukraine, including those tied to the President's calls with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, discussion of investigations related to the Bidens and Burisma, and the freezing of US security assistance to Ukraine. The amendments included calls to subpoena the White House, National Security Council, State Department and OMB for documents.  But McConnell said on the Senate floor before the trial began that he has the votes from Republicans to move forward. McConnell said his proposal tracked closely with President Bill Clinton's 1999 impeachment trial that was ""fair, even-handed and tracks closely with past precedents."" Impeachment guide: Voting on the trial rules  ""Here in the Senate, the President's lawyers will finally receive a level playing field with the House Democrats, and will finally be able to present the President's case,"" McConnell said. Cipollone, who is leading the President's defense, said the President's team backed the resolution. ""We believe that once you hear those initial presentations, the only conclusion will be that the President has done absolutely nothing wrong,"" Cipollone said. ""And that these articles of impeachment do not begin to approach the standard required by the Constitution."" Trump is in Davos, Switzerland, for the Davos World Economic Forum, but he still weighed in on Twitter when the trial started. ""READ THE TRANSCRIPTS!"" he wrote. In an interview with CNBC while in Davos, Trump said he watched ""some"" of the impeachment trial and thought his team's performance during the first day of the trial was ""really good."" He again defended himself, saying his conversation with Zelensky was ""perfect."" House managers, President's team clash Tuesday's session was the first substantive day in the Senate trial after the House impeached Trump last month for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. House Democrats charge that the President abused his office by withholding US security aid and a White House meeting while pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, and then covered it up by obstructing the impeachment inquiry. The House impeachment managers and the President's legal team included a summary of their case against the President — including playing television clips of the President's comments and snippets of the witness testimony from the House impeachment inquiry — as they detailed their case for pursuing documents and subpoenas to witnesses. ""The misconduct set out in those articles is the most serious ever charged against a president,"" Schiff said. ""When the founders wrote the impeachment clause, they had precisely this type of conduct in mind, conduct that abuses the power of office for a personal benefit, that undermines our national security, and that invites foreign interference in the democratic process of an election."" The President's lawyers pushed back against the House, charging that the House's impeachment inquiry failed to give the President due process and the House failed to actually follow through on its subpoenas in court after the White House challenged them. The President's legal team largely focused on the process issues in the debate for more witnesses and documents. ""If I showed up in any court in this country and I said, 'Judge, my case is overwhelming, but I'm not ready to go yet. I need more evidence' ... I would get thrown out in two seconds,"" Cipollone said. ""And that's exactly what should happen here."" The managers and the President's team each received an hour to debate each amendment, with several speaking at the lectern in the well of the Senate. Schiff and Cipollone used the time to push back on charges the other side was making, jumping in before or after the designated speaker who gave the bulk of the argument. As the hours of debate dragged into the evening Tuesday, senators settled into their role in the trial as silent jurors, prohibited from speaking during the debates on amendments they would vote on. Some senators took notes and listened attentively, while others slunk back in their chairs as the House managers and President's team took turns arguing the trial rules. Side conversations appeared to grow from fleeting whispers to quiet conversations, some even leading to laughs — despite the rules threatening senators with ""pain of imprisonment"" for speaking. Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, absent-mindedly clicked his retractable pen for about a minute, before GOP Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa turned to look at him and he stopped. Sens. Tim Scott of South Carolina and Ben Sasse of Nebraska dug into Sasse's stash of jaw breakers, while whispering to each other and trading notes. At one point, Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana stopped in his note taking to pass a note to Sasse, who added something to it and passed it on to Scott. Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, said it was up to Schumer how many amendments would be offered — and how late into the night Tuesday's debate would go. But he argued it was necessary because it could be Democrats' only chance to force votes on witnesses and documents. ""We need to put Republicans on record,"" Murphy said. ""We may not have another chance to offer amendments to get witnesses and documents before the Senate."" From 1999 to now Since the House passed the two articles of impeachment last month, McConnell has said he would follow the precedent of Clinton's 1999 impeachment trial. McConnell has pointed to the fact that the Senate put off the question of witnesses until later in the trial, after opening arguments and the senators' period for asking questions had concluded. At that point, three witnesses were deposed, and portions of those depositions were played in the Senate chamber. McConnell's resolution similarly puts the question of witnesses until after each side has 24 hours for their opening arguments — split over three days now, instead of two — and 16 hours of Senate questions. At that point, the Senate will vote generally on whether it should seek witnesses and documents, and then it will consider individual witnesses. But Democrats say there are key differences. The Senate's Clinton witnesses had already testified before the grand jury, while the witnesses Democrats are now seeking — Mulvaney, Bolton, White House budget official Michael Duffey and White House aide Rob Blair — refused to testify during the House's impeachment inquiry. Democrats have also pointed to other divergences from Clinton as a sign McConnell is trying to rush the trial. The Clinton trial still provided four days per side for opening arguments, though splitting it up over three days means it's unlikely the sessions will stretch beyond midnight as initially expected. Schiff on Tuesday cited the documents Democrats are seeking from the Trump administration as the most important pieces of evidence to still obtain. ""If we're truly interested in fair trial, the first step ought to be the production of the documents,"" Schiff said. ""Those will reveal precisely who the most important witnesses are."" This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday."

199,CNN,"""On something as important as impeachment, Senator McConnell's resolution is nothing short of a national disgrace. ... Senator McConnell's resolution stipulates that key facts be delivered in the wee hours of the night simply because he doesn't want the American people to hear them."" Schumer vowed to challenge the Kentucky Republican's plan with amendments on Tuesday at the start of the trial. Democrats are expected to try to force an early vote on the issue of calling new witnesses, a step that is provided for in McConnell's resolution at the end of the grueling process of prosecution and defense presentations. The fact that McConnell's resolution includes language on potential votes over witnesses appears to be an attempt to navigate between Trump's demands for a swift acquittal and the desire of vulnerable swing-state Republican senators to avoid offering the impression that the trial is not fair. Trump is facing two articles of impeachment, alleging abuse of power in Ukraine and obstruction of Congress, after he intervened to stop key officials from testifying to the House investigation before he was formally impeached in December. The President was thousands of miles away from his trial Tuesday in Davos in the Swiss Alps, where he gave a speech touting America's success and his own new trade deals at the World Economic Forum. But he was still fuming about impeachment. ""It's just a hoax,"" he said when asked about the situation. ""It's a witch hunt that's been going on for years, and frankly, it's disgraceful."" The trial is an emblem of wider political divides The disputes over process at the start of only the third impeachment trial of a president reflect America's internal political estrangement, which has been exacerbated by a presidency built on exploiting societal fault lines. Because everybody accepts that the President is almost certain to be acquitted, each smaller battle in the trial takes on extra political importance.  Democrats want to call new witnesses including former national security adviser John Bolton, who branded Trump's unofficial envoy to Ukraine, Rudy Giuliani, as a ""hand grenade,"" and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who essentially confirmed a quid pro quo in Ukraine in public. Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland called for a process that allows testimony from key witnesses under oath. ""How can you have a fair trial if you don't hear from witnesses who have direct knowledge to the key facts?"" Cardin said on CNN's ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer."" But Republicans are threatening to match such demands with subpoenas for former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter -- despite the lack of any evidence that either was involved in corruption in Ukraine. A new CNN/SSRS poll published Monday highlights the pressure on Republican senators -- such as Colorado's Cory Gardner, Maine's Susan Collins and Arizona's Martha McSally -- who face tough reelection races. Sixty-nine percent of respondents said the trial should feature testimony from new witnesses who did not appear in the House impeachment hearings. The poll also explains the wider political dynamics around the trial. About half of Americans -- 51% -- say Trump should be removed from office. But his approval rating remains at a steady 43%. The fact that only 8% of Republicans think Trump should be kicked out of the Oval Office helps explain why there is no two-thirds Senate majority to eject him. There are already suspicions that McConnell's conditions for the prosecution and defense cases each to be presented in two 12-hour blocks are an attempt to hide the most damning allegations against Trump in late-night sittings.  Cardin suggested the plan may be designed to ""saturate the hours so people don't pay attention and try to get this over quickly rather than allowing a fair trial to take place."" The dispute over witnesses who Democrats say are needed to ensure the trial offers a ""fair"" examination of Trump's alleged offenses is merely a symptom of the unbridgeable chasms between Republicans and Democrats. In a sign that McConnell's rules will likely prevail, one moderate Republican, Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, said he would support them and pointed out that they did guarantee a vote on witnesses. ""Just because the House proceedings were a circus that doesn't mean the Senate's trial needs to be,"" Alexander said in a statement. ""We have a constitutional duty to hear the case. That means to me, No. 1, hear the arguments on both sides, and not dismiss the case out of hand. No. 2, ask our questions, consider the answers and study the record. No. 3, be guaranteed a right to vote on whether we need additional evidence. Evidence could be documents; it could be witnesses; or there could be no need for additional evidence,"" he said. But there's no agreement even on basic facts: The rough transcript of a call that appears to show Trump leaning on Ukraine's President for dirt on Biden, Trump's potential 2020 rival, is touted by the President and his supporters as ""perfect."" There's not even a common understanding of the meaning of impeachment itself. Trump's defense will be anchored on an argument that Congress' ultimate sanction against a president requires the commission of a crime. But many scholars believe historical evidence shows the founders meant for the ""high crimes and Misdemeanors"" phrase in the Constitution to encompass abuses of the public trust by presidents using their power for personal gain. In keeping with the tone of the Trump presidency, the White House defense brief released on Monday does not fully engage with the mountains of evidence suggesting troubling presidential conduct unearthed by the House impeachment inquiry. It instead uses sloganeering and insults to blast the impeachment as a ""charade"" and claims that it is a ""dangerous perversion"" of the Constitution. The clashes at the start of the trial also exemplify another dominant political theme of the era, of how a Senate Republican caucus that is ruthlessly competent in wielding power is in lockstep with a President who harbors an expansive vision of his own largely unrestrained authority. At its root, the trial will raise a profound question about a core principle of American democracy -- whether the checks and balances that prevent one branch of government becoming too powerful are now unfit for that purpose. Democrats reject Trump's defense In a new pretrial brief filed on Monday, House Democratic impeachment managers pushed back on Trump's response to the Senate summons, in which his lawyers argued that he had acted within his rights in Ukraine. ""President Trump maintains that the Senate cannot remove him even if the House proves every claim in the Articles of impeachment. That is a chilling assertion,"" the nine-page brief said. ""The Framers deliberately drafted a Constitution that allows the Senate to remove Presidents who, like President Trump, abuse their power to cheat in elections, betray our national security, and ignore checks and balances,"" the House managers wrote. ""That President Trump believes otherwise, and insists he is free to engage in such conduct again, only highlights the continuing threat he poses to the Nation if allowed to remain in office."" Trump's legal team laid out the most detailed summary of its defense on Monday. ""The Senate should speedily reject these deficient articles of impeachment and acquit the president,"" the brief said. ""The Articles themselves -- and the rigged process that brought them here -- are a brazenly political act by House Democrats that must be rejected,"" the 110-page brief argues. The President's lawyers also construct a new argument that he was well within his powers to ask Ukraine to investigate Biden. ""House Democrats' accusations rest on the false and dangerous premise that Vice President Biden somehow immunized his conduct (and his son's) from any scrutiny by declaring his run for the presidency,"" the lawyers write. ""There is no such rule of law. It certainly was not a rule applied when President Trump was a candidate. His political opponents called for investigations against him and his children almost daily."" Such arguments are why many Democrats are wary of any step that could lead Hunter Biden to testify, as it could satisfy Trump's hope of dirtying the former vice president's image ahead of a possible November election duel. Trump's claim that the impeachment is invalid because it does not charge a criminal offense is also a controversial position. It is expected to be laid out by veteran Harvard Professor Emeritus Alan Dershowitz. Impeachment attorney and CNN legal analyst Ross Garber faulted the constitutional grounds for Dershowitz's argument. ""I'm not sure of anybody who defended more impeachments than I have. And even I think Dershowitz is wrong on this. I don't think you need a technical criminal violation for there to be an impeachable offense,"" Garber said.

(Vindman testified that two ""substantive"" changes he suggested were not made, though he also testified that the document remained ""substantively correct."")   3. Trump did not ask Zelensky for anything on the call. (Trump asked Zelensky to look into former Vice President Joe Biden, look into a debunked conspiracy theory about Democratic computer servers, and speak with his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr.) 4.

Zelensky affirmed in December that ""President Trump did nothing wrong."" (Zelensky has said Trump applied ""no pressure,"" but he did not say Trump did nothing wrong. Zelensky did say, ""Look, I never talked to the President from the position of a quid pro quo. That's not my thing."" But he continued: ""I don't want us to look like beggars. But you have to understand. We're at war. If you're our strategic partner, then you can't go blocking anything for us. I think that's just about fairness. It's not about a quid pro quo.

(While the whistleblower did get information about the call from other people, the whistleblower also had ""direct knowledge of certain alleged conduct,"" noted Michael Atkinson, the Trump-appointed inspector general for the intelligence community.) 15. The whistleblower ""said 'quid pro quo' eight times."" (The whistleblower did not even use the words ""quid pro quo"" in the complaint, much less specify a number of times Trump allegedly said those words. Trump may have been referring to a Wall Street Journal article that had asserted that Trump urged Zelensky ""about eight times to work with Rudy Giuliani"" on a probe that could hurt Biden; the article did not say this claim came from the whistleblower.) 16. The whistleblower ""works now for Biden."" (There is no evidence for this. The whistleblower's lawyers said their client has never worked for or advised a candidate, campaign or party; the lawyers said the whistleblower has come into contact with presidential candidates for both parties while working as a civil servant in the executive branch.) 17. Someone ""changed the long standing whistleblower rules"" just before this whistleblower submitted their complaint. (Contrary to a report on a right-wing website, the whistleblower rules were not changed.) House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff 18. Schiff committed ""a criminal act"" by delivering an exaggerated interpretation of Trump's July 25 call at a committee hearing. (The Constitution gives members of Congress immunity for comments they make at committee.) 19. Schiff did have immunity for his comments at the committee, but not when he tweeted a video of those comments. (Experts say members of Congress also have immunity for videos of their comments at committee.) 20. Schiff might have committed ""treason."" (Treason has a specific constitutional definition that Schiff's actions do not come close to meeting.) 21. Schiff made his comments before Trump released the rough transcript of the call, not expecting Trump to release it. (Schiff spoke the day after Trump released the document.) 22. Schiff ""didn't use one word that I said"" in his rendition of the call. (Schiff did add words Trump had never said, but he didn't make up the whole thing; some of his remarks hewed closely to what Trump said.) 23. Schiff might have been the whistleblower's source. (This is nonsense. The whistleblower said in the complaint that information about the call came from ""multiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call."") 24. ""A lot of people think that Schiff basically is, essentially, the whistleblower. He already told the whistleblower what to do."" (Schiff is not the whistleblower, ""essentially"" or otherwise. The whistleblower sought guidance from Schiff's committee before filing their complaint, but there is no evidence Schiff dictated the content of the complaint.) 25. Schiff might have picked the whistleblower. (There is no evidence for this, either.) 26. Schiff ""will only release doctored transcripts."" (Schiff has already released multiple transcripts of testimony from closed-door impeachment inquiry hearings, and there was no sign that any of them had been ""doctored."" Witnesses and their lawyers were given the opportunity to verify the accuracy of the transcripts prior to release, and Republicans who attended the testimony did not allege that any transcripts had been improperly altered.) The impeachment process 27. Republicans were not allowed into the closed-door impeachment inquiry hearings. (Republican members of the three committees holding the hearings were allowed into the room and to ask questions of witnesses. Only Republicans who were not on the committees were barred from the room.) 28. Republicans were not allowed to ask questions in the closed-door hearings. (Republicans were allowed to ask questions. Democrats and Republicans alternated questioning.) 29. Republicans were not allowed to ask questions in the public hearing held by the House Intelligence Committee on November 15. (Republicans were allowed to ask questions. Schiff would not grant a request from the committee's top Republican, Rep. Devin Nunes, to hand some of Nunes' questioning time to Rep. Elise Stefanik, because only Nunes was allowed to speak at that point in the hearing, but Stefanik got to ask questions later in the day.)  30. Republicans were not allowed to have lawyers participate in the public hearings chaired by Schiff. (They were. Lawyer Steve Castor questioned witnesses on behalf of the Republicans on the committee. It was Trump himself who was not allowed to have a lawyer participate.) 31. Nobody else has ever faced closed-door impeachment hearings. (Both the Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton impeachment processes involved some closed-door hearings.) 32. Trump's opponents have committed ""illegal acts"" related to impeachment. (Trump wasn't clear about who he was talking about, but there is no evidence of illegality by either the whistleblower or Democrats.) 33. The people who have testified in the impeachment inquiry have had ""no firsthand knowledge."" (Various witnesses have had firsthand knowledge of various components of the story.) 34. Gordon Sondland, ambassador to the European Union, maintained there was ""no quid pro quo."" (Sondland revised his original testimony. While he continued to say that Trump told him there was no quid pro quo, he said his own belief was that there was a quid pro quo.) 35. Unlike Democrats, former House Speaker Paul Ryan ""would never issue a subpoena."" (Numerous Republican subpoenas were issued to the Obama administration during Ryan's tenure as speaker.) 36. ""Many"" of the people who had testified as of October 21 ""were put there during Obama, during Clinton, during the Never Trump or Bush era."" (FactCheck.org noted that just two of the nine people who had testified at that point had been appointed under Obama. The other seven were appointed by Trump or his appointees.) 37. Pelosi gave Trump ""the most unfair trial in the history of the U.S. Congress."" (The House did not hold a trial at all. Under the Constitution, it is the Senate that has the sole power to try impeachments.)  38. Trump was ""deprived of basic Constitutional Due Process"" during the House impeachment process, ""including the right to present evidence, to have my own counsel present, to confront accusers, and to call and cross-examine witnesses."" (The rights of criminal defendants do not apply to public officials in a House of Representatives impeachment process.) 39. ""More due process was afforded to those accused in the Salem Witch Trials."" (This is absurd. Nineteen innocent people were hanged after they were accused of witchcraft in the trials of the late 1600s. The courts accepted ""spectral evidence"" from dreams. Some of the accused were tortured into confessions.)  40. Trump ""won 196 to nothing"" in the House. (Trump did not win any vote related to impeachment. He lost an October vote to set the rules of the impeachment inquiry, 232-196, then the December votes on the two articles of impeachment, 230-197 and 229-198. He appeared to mean that there were no Republican defections from his side, but he didn't explain here.) 41. Democrats are ""not doing anything"" on gun violence because ""all they do is the impeachment nonsense."" (The Democratic-controlled House passed a bill in February to require background checks on all gun sales. The Republican-controlled Senate has refused to hold a vote on the bill.)  The Bidens 42. Joe Biden, along with his son Hunter Biden, has ""ripped off at least two countries for millions of dollars."" (There is no evidence Joe Biden has profited from his son's business dealings abroad.) 43. Joe Biden was ""possibly"" paid millions of dollars by foreign countries ""for doing NOTHING."" (Again, there is no evidence of this.)  44. A video of Joe Biden speaking in 2018 about his past dealings with Ukraine is evidence of ""corruption."" (The tape does not show corruption. It shows Biden talking about his effort, in accordance with the policy of the US and its allies, to pressure Ukraine into firing a prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was widely considered unwilling to fight corruption.) 45. There is a photo of Joe Biden playing golf with ""the company boss"" of Burisma, the Ukrainian company for which Hunter Biden sat on the board. (Neither Burisma's owner nor chief executive is in the photo. The person Trump had identified as a ""Ukraine gas exec"" was Devon Archer, another American board member at Burisma and a longtime business associate of Hunter Biden.) 46. That golf photo contradicts Joe Biden's claim to have ""never met the gentleman."" (Joe Biden had not claimed to have never met Devon Archer.) 47. Hunter Biden was under investigation by Shokin. (There is no public evidence that Hunter Biden was ever himself under investigation. The prosecutor's former deputy, Vitaliy Kasko, has said that the actual investigation, into the owner of Burisma, was dormant at the time of Joe Biden's pressure.) 48. Shokin was ""prosecuting"" Burisma. (There was no prosecution, only the investigation that Kasko has said was dormant.) 49. Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to take Shokin ""off the case."" (There is no evidence that Biden ever tried to get Shokin taken off the Burisma case. Rather, Biden, like the US government more broadly, tried to get Shokin fired.) 50. Biden admitted in an NPR interview that this effort to get Shokin fired ""looked bad."" (Biden's ""looked bad"" comment was not about Shokin. Rather, Biden said ""the appearance"" of Hunter Biden's presence on the board ""looked bad and it gave folks like Rudy Giuliani an excuse to come up with a Trumpian kind of defense."")  51. Before Joe Biden denied that he had spoken to Hunter Biden about Hunter's overseas business activities, Joe Biden had said he did speak to Hunter about those business activities. (Joe Biden had not said he did speak to Hunter Biden about those business activities. Hunter Biden said they had one brief conversation in which Joe Biden asked him if he knew what he was doing.) 52. Hunter Biden's acts were ""illegal."" (Hunter Biden has acknowledged using ""poor judgment"" in accepting the seat on the Burisma board, but there is no evidence of illegality.) 53. Before Hunter Biden got business opportunities during Joe Biden's vice-presidency, he had ""never made 10 cents in his life."" (Hunter Biden, a lawyer, had worked prior to Joe Biden's vice-presidency as a bank executive, at the Department of Commerce and as a lobbyist. He had also served on the board of Amtrak.)  Dealings with Ukraine 54. Trump ""didn't delay"" the military aid to Ukraine. (His administration did delay the aid.) 55. The aid ""got there two or three weeks ahead of schedule -- long before it was supposed to be there."" (Because of Trump's freeze, $35 million of the aid could not get out the door before the legal deadline of the end of September, forcing Congress to pass a deadline extension.) 56. Democratic senators sent a letter to Ukraine that threatened to deny US aid if the Ukrainians did not comply with their demands. (The letter did not make any threat to Ukraine. The senators expressed concern about a New York Times report that Ukraine had, to avoid Trump's wrath, stopped cooperating with the Mueller investigation and frozen investigations into former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. The letter urged Ukraine to reverse course if the report was true.) 57. President Barack Obama sent mere ""pillows and sheets"" in aid to Ukraine. (Trump was correct that Obama refused to provide lethal military assistance, but Obama sent other military assistance: drones, armored Humvees, counter-mortar radars, night vision devices and medical supplies.) 58. The US is the ""only"" country providing assistance to Ukraine, and ""nobody else is there."" (European countries have provided billions in grants and loans to Ukraine since Russia's 2014 invasion.) 59. Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike is primarily owned by someone from Ukraine. (CrowdStrike is a publicly traded, US-based company co-founded by Dmitri Alperovitch, an American citizen who was born in Russia.)   Polls 60. Impeachment has caused Trump's poll numbers to go ""way up"" to ""higher than they've ever been, ever."" (There has been no sign of a significant increase in Trump's poll numbers. His approval rating has fallen slightly since the Ukraine scandal began, according to FiveThirtyEight's poll aggregate.) 61. It was ""announced"" that a Fox News poll showing majority support for impeaching and removing Trump from office was ""incorrect."" (Fox News says it stands by the poll.) 62. Support for impeachment dropped ""down into the 20's in some polls"" in November. (CNN could find no scientific public polls at the time with support for impeachment as low as the 20s.)  63. November polling on impeachment showed that, ""Everybody said, 'That's really bullshit.'...Everybody."" (Not even close to ""everybody."" Polls had consistently shown support for impeachment at or above 40%.)  Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch 64. ""Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad. She started off in Somalia, how did that go?"" (There is no basis for Trump's suggestion that Somalia ""turned bad"" because Yovanovitch served there as a new foreign service officer in the mid-to-late 1980s; Somalia had severe economic and social problems before she arrived. And since Trump said ""everywhere,"" it's worth noting she also served at the US embassy in Canada.)  65. Yovanovitch refused to hang Trump's picture at the US embassy in Ukraine for ""like a year and a half, or two years."" (There is no evidence for this claim. The Trump administration itself caused a delay: it took the administration more than nine months after Trump's inauguration to distribute his official photo to government buildings, CNBC reported in 2017.) "
202,CNN,"""The UK is my home and a place that I love. That will never change. ""I have grown up feeling support from so many of you, and I watched as you welcomed Meghan with open arms as you saw me find the love and happiness that I had hoped for all my life. Finally, the second son of Diana got hitched, hurray! ""I also know you've come to know me well enough over all these years to trust that the woman I chose as my wife upholds the same values as I do. And she does, and she's the same woman I fell in love with. ""We both do everything we can to fly the flag and carry out our roles for this country with pride. Once Meghan and I were married, we were excited, we were hopeful, and we were here to serve. ""For those reasons, it brings me great sadness that it has come to this. ""The decision that I have made for my wife and I to step back, is not one I made lightly. It was so many months of talks after so many years of challenges. And I know I haven't always gotten it right, but as far as this goes, there really was no other option. ""What I want to make clear is we're not walking away, and we certainly aren't walking away from you. Our hope was to continue serving the Queen, the Commonwealth, and my military associations, but without public funding. Unfortunately, that wasn't possible. ""I've accepted this, knowing that it doesn't change who I am or how committed I am. But I hope that helps you understand what it had to come to, that I would step my family back from all I have ever known, to take a step forward into what I hope can be a more peaceful life. ""I was born into this life, and it is a great honor to serve my country and the Queen. ""When I lost my mum 23 years ago, you took me under your wing. ""You've looked out for me for so long, but the media is a powerful force, and my hope is one day our collective support for each other can be more powerful because this is so much bigger than just us. ""It has been our privilege to serve you, and we will continue to lead a life of service.

""First, may I echo Johnny's words earlier and thank in particular Patricia and Richard, and all the teams involved in making tonight so very special and such a success... at least so far... ""Thank you also for turning up! ""I'm sure Lewis was the draw factor, but I know you will all be leaving tonight with a better understanding about what we're trying to achieve at Sentebale, and that's what really matters to us.

""Struck by the hardship and challenges so many children faced, and with the support of local partners, we set up Sentebale two years later. The word Sentebale means ""forget me not"" in Sesotho and also serves as a memory of both Prince Seeiso's mother as well as my own. ""Since the beginning, we've developed a series of programs and created the purpose built Mamahato centre to help a generation of children break through the stigma that is allowing the HIV epidemic to thrive. Half of those children had lost either one or both of their parents to the virus. ""But today through our networks of clubs, camps and programs across both Lesotho and Botswana, we help children and young adults to learn that they can go on to live happy and productive lives, despite being HIV positive. ""We teach them that this human immunodeficiency virus doesn't have to be a death sentence for anyone anymore, that the real enemy we are fighting is stigma, and the antiquated attitudes that work against young people coming forward when wanting to take an HIV test. ""This is relevant in every part of the world today, including here in the UK, where there are an estimated 110,000 people living with HIV. ""Here, I can't not mention my dear friend Gareth Thomas -- who in my mind -- has quite literally changed the way people think about HIV -- so thank you bud.

203,CNN,"Speaking to reporters on Sunday in New Hampshire, Sanders dug in on the charges. ""I think anyone who looks at the vice president's record understands that time after time after time, Joe has talked about the need to cut Social Security,"" Sanders said. ""That's in the congressional record. He has said that many, many times. I don't think that's disputable.""  Sanders specifically cited Biden's role in ""the so-called 'Balanced Budget' effort,"" a mid-1990s push to require by law that government spending does not exceed revenue in a given fiscal year, before highlighting his opposition: ""I put together a -- we called it a 'defending Social Security caucus,' (and) played a very active role in saying, 'No, you can't cut Social Security when for millions of elderly people, this is what they live on.' You can't cut it."" ""He's said it many, many times,"" Sanders added, ""that he believes it appropriate to cut social security or freeze (cost-of-living adjustments) or to raise the retirement age. That's just the record. I don't think anyone can debate that."" The questions over Biden's speech, though, muddled the campaign's attempt to bring the fundamental issue to the foreground.  Sanders campaign speechwriter David Sirota previously cited Biden's Brookings speech in a newsletter to supporters, writing that Biden ""lauded Paul Ryan for proposing cuts to Social Security and Medicare."" PolitiFact rated that description as ""false,"" writing that Sirota had misrepresented Biden's ""sarcastic"" comment about Ryan.  Social Security is one of the most popular government programs across party lines, along with Medicare, and many high-ranking Democrats in the 1980s and 1990s -- like Biden -- sought to signal their seriousness about the deficit by expressing a willingness to negotiate with the GOP over plans to slow its growth or raise the retirement age. Despite having gone on the record in the past decades saying he would be willing to buck his party to strike a bipartisan deal on Social Security, Biden drew a clear line on one of the most aggressive GOP proposals: The George W. Bush administration quickly abandoned a 2005 move to privatize it.  Biden spokesman Andrew Bates on Sunday pushed back against the full force of the Sanders campaign and its supporters, who have flooded social media with an assortment of old news clips showing Biden talking about potential changes to the program, citing Sanders' own words. ""As Bernie Sanders himself said in 2015: 'Joe Biden is a man who has devoted his entire life to public service and to the wellbeing of working families and the middle class,'"" Bates said in a statement. As Biden's claim about the video began to circulate on Saturday evening, Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir fired back, saying in a statement that Biden ""should be honest with voters and stop trying to doctor his own public record of consistently and repeatedly trying to cut Social Security.""  ""The facts are very clear: Biden not only pushed to cut Social Security -- he is on tape proudly bragging about it on multiple occasions,"" Shakir said. Biden during his time in the Senate publicly expressed an openness to either freezing year-over-year cost-of-living increases, as part of a bipartisan plan to slow federal spending, or raising the retirement age in order to preserve the program while managing the federal budget.  Sanders has been a consistent and fierce supporter of growing the New Deal-era program and, during the Obama years, emerged as a leading opposition voice when it was reported that cuts were being considered by a bipartisan presidential deficit commission. Last year, the Vermont senator reintroduced legislation that would add more than 50 years of sustainability to the program, which on its current track would no longer be able to pay out full benefits by 2034, by subjecting all income above $250,000 to the existing 12.4% Social Security payroll tax, which is split between workers and employers. Sanders would also levy a new 6.2% tax on investment income above $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for couples. The revenue boosts proposed by Sanders, in the legislation and by his campaign, would increase benefits for all Social Security recipients and make the annual cost of living adjustment more generous. In an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper earlier this month, Sanders skewered Biden on everything from his support for NAFTA, the unpopular and soon-to-be-replaced trade deal, to his vote to authorize the Iraq War.  ""Joe Biden has been on the floor of the Senate talking about the need to cut Social Security or Medicare or Medicaid,"" Sanders added, as part of a riff suggesting that his Democratic primary rival would make for a poor candidate in November's general election. A Biden campaign aide pointed to the former Delaware senator's ""100% lifetime record on Social Security votes"" from the Alliance for Retired Americans as evidence of his fidelity to the program and accused the Sanders campaign of pushing a ""video and transcript that were intentionally, deceptively edited to make it seem like Vice President Biden was praising and agreeing with Paul Ryan, when it is clear he was doing the exact opposite."" The aide argued that the clip met the threshold for being labeled as ""doctored."" Despite the questions over how they had initially presented their case against Biden, the Sanders campaign seemed to delight in Biden stirring the pot on an issue they believe Biden's record -- when cast against Sanders' -- could damage him with Democratic primary voters with the first round of voting, in Iowa, a little more than two weeks away.  ""Biden is desperately trying to muddy the waters by dishonestly manufacturing a fake nonsensical controversy over one single video -- because he knows there are multiple videos out there of public speeches he made proudly congratulating himself for working to cut Social Security,"" Sirota told CNN. ""In trying to cut Social Security, Joe Biden is telling us exactly who he is -- and we should believe him."""
204,CNN,"Although police arrested Hadden in 2012 after a patient complained he assaulted her, the arrest was voided and he was released as the DA's office investigated. Yang told CNN Hadden abused her after this point.   ""It's like getting slapped in the face and punched in the gut,"" she said. ""The DA's office is meant to protect us, is meant to serve justice, and there was no justice here."" Several former patients in civil lawsuits allege that Hadden manipulated them by making inappropriate sexual remarks ""in an effort to lower their boundaries and break-down their defenses,"" then abused them by ""ogling, groping, verbally assaulting, and physically abusing, violating, sexually abusing, and penetrating"" them during the performance of medically unnecessary examinations. Cyrus R. Vance Jr., Manhattan's district attorney, has defended his office's prosecution of Hadden on the grounds that trials do not guarantee convictions and the plea agreement reached with Hadden ensured a felony conviction and the end of his medical career.  Yet documents obtained from Vance's office by one of Hadden's accusers through a public records request and shared with CNN show that prosecutors were initially prepared to accept an even more lenient agreement with Hadden. In a 2018 email, a prosecutor in Vance's office reacted to a news article about the case and stated that the initial plea deal worked out between Hadden's attorney and the DA's office involved only a misdemeanor. When Hadden's attorney ""met with me to complain about the misdemeanor I upped it to a felony,"" she wrote. Anthony DiPietro, an attorney who represents more than 30 former patients now suing Hadden and Columbia University and its affiliates, argues the district attorney's office essentially allowed Hadden to get away with sexual assault.  ""He received what seems to be the equivalent of an early paid retirement,"" DiPietro said. ""There was a well-coordinated effort between the district attorney ... and Columbia University to basically give him the most favorable plea deal possible."" Hadden has denied the assault allegations in court documents, aside from the two counts -- criminal sexual act in the third degree and forcible touching -- to which he pleaded guilty. Neither Hadden nor his civil defense attorney provided comment for this story.  DiPietro questions whether Hadden's defense attorney, Isabelle Kirshner, had disproportionate influence on prosecutors. Kirshner previously worked in the Manhattan DA's office, served as a member of Vance's transition committee and has donated about $6,000 since 2010 to Vance's campaigns for district attorney.  During a phone call in 2018, Vance told one of Hadden's accusers, Marissa Hoechstetter, that he doesn't believe he ever talked about the case with Kirshner. Vance had reached out to Hoechstetter after she repeatedly contacted the DA's office to discuss her experience as one of Hadden's patients. ""The decisions on the resolution of the case were made with my chief assistant after talking with the sex crimes bureau. That's not an expression of disinterest. I'm accountable for all decisions,"" Vance told Hoechstetter, according to a rough transcript of the June 28, 2018 call Hoechstetter obtained through a records request.  While Vance refuted the notion that any outside relationships affected decisions regarding Hadden, he told Hoechstetter that he has since made a commitment not to accept political contributions from lawyers who have had business with the DA's office in the preceding six months.  Kirshner says she has not seen any evidence that her political donations had any influence on the case. She told CNN she attributed the terms of the deal to ""good lawyering."" ""The initial offer was four years, but we raised enough factual questions with the case, and given victims' reluctance to talk in these cases, we were able to negotiate a settlement everyone could agree on,"" Kirshner said.  Hoechstetter was not one of the victims described in Hadden's indictment but says in a civil suit that Hadden abused her when she was his patient between 2009 and 2012. She told CNN she sees a pattern in the Manhattan DA's handling of the cases of Hadden, Jeffrey Epstein, Harvey Weinstein and others involving wealthy, influential white men accused or convicted of sexual assault.  Asked if she wants an apology, Hoechstetter said: ""I don't want an apology. I want action. I want them to make change. I want them to take responsibility and show me that people will be treated differently in the future."" In the case of Epstein, the DA's office sided with the multi-millionaire's defense team in 2011 and asked that Epstein be labeled a Level 1 sex offender. A judge rejected the request and termed Epstein a Level 3 sex offender, meaning his designation would not expire and his name would appear in a public sex offender registry. The DA's office has said its argument in that request was a mistake based on a legal misunderstanding, and that the office later agreed with the judge's determination.  And the DA's office initially did not prosecute movie mogul Weinstein after allegations of sexual abuse emerged in 2015 though he is now being tried on charges of rape and sexual assault. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty. In response to CNN's specific questions about its handling of the Hadden case, a spokesperson for the Manhattan DA's office initially said, ""our office does not comment on investigations or investigative steps taken."" After CNN notified the office of Evelyn Yang's public allegations on Thursday, Vance said, ""While we stand by our legal analysis and resulting disposition of this difficult case, we regret that this resolution has caused survivors pain."" Court documents filed in the civil suits brought by Yang, Hoechstetter and others allege that the red flags regarding Hadden accumulated over the course of decades. One lawsuit details a nurse telling her supervisor in the early 90s that she observed the gynecologist sexually abuse a patient. She was told to ""keep quiet"" and ""don't let him get himself in trouble,"" according to the suit.  Documents filed by prosecutors in the criminal case allege that Hadden gave one woman who was his patient between 2006 and 2011 ""breast exams during every prenatal visit, even though her pregnancies were normal and she had no breast-related complaints or concerns.""  Another patient told investigators Hadden would ""routinely examine her without a nurse present"" and that he ""repeatedly squeezed her nipples"" and on one occasion ""lightly slapped her buttocks,"" according to those documents.   A nurse said that when she knocked on the door during one of these examinations, ""Hadden jumped back and away from the patient... he made no mention of what he had been doing moments before, and acted is if nothing had happened,"" the documents state.   Arrested, released and continued seeing patients In June 2012, New York police were called to Hadden's clinic after a woman complained that he licked her vagina during a checkup, according to a police report. Officers arrested Hadden. Despite the severity of the allegation, Hadden's arrest was voided and he was let go because the ""case required significant investigation and time,"" according to statements by a prosecutor at Hadden's 2014 arraignment. ""The arrest was voided and the case was pursued as a sex crimes investigation,"" the prosecutor added. ""Since that time we have been speaking to dozens of other women, nurses and potential witnesses."" After his release, Hadden continued seeing patients. Evelyn Yang says Hadden abused her during this time.  ""That's what's very painful is knowing that what happened to me could have been prevented,"" Yang told CNN. ""Can you imagine the audacity of man who... continues to do this after being arrested? It's like he knew that he wouldn't face any repercussions, that he was protected.""  Columbia University did not respond to CNN's questions on exactly when and on what terms Hadden's employment ended. In a statement, the university called the allegations ""abhorrent"" and said, ""we deeply apologize to those whose trust was violated.""   Hadden's attorney, Kirshner, says he continued to work for Columbia after his arrest but was let go in the midst of an internal investigation in the weeks that followed.   In 2014, a grand jury indicted Hadden on five counts of a criminal sexual act, two counts of forcible touching and two counts of sexual abuse. During his June 2014 arraignment, the district attorney's office said the case involved ""numerous victims over the course of years"" and recommended Hadden receive four years in prison.  But in 2016, Hadden reached an agreement with prosecutors that allowed him to avoid prison time by pleading guilty to one felony of criminal sexual act in the third degree and one misdemeanor of forcible touching, surrendering his medical license and registering as a level one sex offender.  Hoechstetter has become an advocate for victims, and speaks out about her experience. She has also fought to remove Hadden's name from her twin daughters' birth certificates. She pushed New York City lawmakers to pass a law that went into effect this month letting parents remove the name of a doctor from their children's birth certificates, if that individual's license was suspended or revoked for misconduct. Reflecting on the outcome of the case, Hoechstetter says Hadden's case illustrates how individuals who wield influence within powerful institutions can thwart accountability despite exhibiting patterns of abusive behavior. ""There's clear evidence of a pattern of bad behavior by the doctor, a lack of institutional courage by his employer Columbia University, and a lack of willingness to take the case seriously by the Manhattan district attorney,"" Hoechstetter told CNN. ""The combination of all three together to me is enough for me to know that everyone did the best they could to make it go away."""

206,CNN,"A House Foreign Affairs Committee aide confirmed to CNN Thursday the State Department told staff that it would open an investigation. ""Ukraine's position is not to interfere in the domestic affairs of the United States of America. However, the published records contain the fact of possible violation of the legislation of Ukraine and the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which protects the rights of a diplomat in the territory of another country,"" a ministry statement said. ""Ukraine cannot ignore such illegal activities on its territory. After analyzing these materials, the National Police of Ukraine upon their publication started criminal proceedings,"" the statement said. Thursday's announcement comes two days after the former ambassador called for an investigation into the ""disturbing"" notion that she was under surveillance from Parnas and Hyde.  ""Needless to say, the notion that American citizens and others were monitoring Ambassador Yovanovitch's movements for unknown purposes is disturbing,"" said Lawrence S. Robbins, Yovanovitch's attorney, in a statement. ""We trust that the appropriate authorities will conduct an investigation to determine what happened.""  Yovanovitch, who was recalled from her post in Kiev in May 2019 after a smear campaign led by Trump's allies, has been repeatedly maligned by Trump. He told his Ukrainian counterpart in July 2019 that she was ""going to go through some things,"" according to a rough White House transcript of the presidents' conversation -- a message Yovanovitch said she found threatening. In her public testimony last year as part of the impeachment probe, Yovanovitch called on State Department leadership to do more in the face of the attacks on her and her fellow foreign service officers. This story has been updated with additional information."

208,CNN,"Although the people who spoke with CNN noted that surveillance is a common problem for diplomats abroad, they expressed shock and horror Tuesday at the idea that the longtime diplomat was being surveilled by an American. ""It's horrifying, it's just unbelievable,"" retired ambassador Jim Melville said in a phone conversation with CNN. ""The very idea that there were elements, possibly of the US government or connected to the US government, who were trying to do an end run around everything that we've established to keep our mission safe is just outrageous."" Retired ambassador Nancy McEldowney echoed that sentiment.  ""I find this really shocking and alarming and the idea that American citizens would be surveilling an American ambassador with the endorsement of the President's personal attorney, it's just so troubling to me,"" McEldowney told CNN. Another retired ambassador said they had ""never heard of anything like it."" ""It's common that terrorists and former communists do this to us. It's appalling and incomprehensible that somebody who is working for the President's personal lawyer would have been doing this to our ambassador,"" they told CNN. That ambassador explained that surveillance is a ""real problem"" that's ""unfortunately pretty common"" for diplomats. Embassies have ""surveillance detection teams"" -- normally locally hired staff -- ""who actually are out there looking to see if anyone is showing unwarranted interest"" in embassy operations, they said.  ""There are lots of different possible motives"" for surveilling diplomats, the official said, explaining that it is normally used for terrorism or intelligence gathering  -- sometimes to find embarrassing information on a person. That official said Yovanovitch may have known she was being surveilled, noting that in a country like Ukraine that would not be unusual.  However, Melville said her awareness could have been dependent on ""how attentive the host security services -- the Ukrainians in this case -- and our own law enforcement personnel and our diplomatic security personnel were being. It wouldn't be something that she would be expected to notice."" ""It would be something that you would trust that the mission and the structure would be aware of and keep her safe from,"" he said. ""When you're looking for threats, you're looking in certain directions. You're not necessarily checking behind on your own people, and you have to trust that they have your back, not that they're working behind your back."" Embassy personnel assume they are monitored Three sources familiar with the matter told CNN that personnel at the embassy always assume they are being monitored, including through conversations on their cell phones. They were aware that local Ukraine security was always tracking them, the sources said, and did not discount the possibility that someone from a local cell phone company could be paid off to track a certain cell phone, although the sources did not have evidence of that.  It is not hard to know where the US ambassador is, the sources said, as they have high visibility in Kiev and someone can easily be tipped off to keep an eye on the ambassador's movement around the embassy.  Sources say there are apartment buildings close to the facility where someone could easily have eyes on the embassy and staff are keenly aware that the office is visible in broad daylight from the outside. The sources familiar told CNN that Ambassador Bill Taylor -- who took over as charge d'affaires after Yovanovitch's removal -- and other diplomats who recently worked at the US Embassy in Kiev had never met or heard of Hyde until the documents were released Tuesday night.  Yovanovitch, who was recalled from her post in Kiev in May 2019 after a smear campaign led by Trump's allies, has been repeatedly maligned by the US President. He told his Ukrainian counterpart in July 2019 that she was ""going to go through some things,"" according to a rough White House transcript of the presidents' conversation -- a message Yovanovitch said she found threatening.  In her public testimony in November 2019, Yovanovitch called on State Department leadership to do more in the face of the attacks on her and her fellow foreign service officers. Asked whether they believed it would be helpful for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to come out in Yovanovitch's defense in light of the latest developments, both Melville and McEldowney slammed the top US diplomat. ""He hasn't stood up for anybody in the foreign service. All he's looking out for is his own back and the President,"" Melville said. ""He has no interest in the good of the service and its people and he's made that abundantly clear repeatedly."" McEldowney told CNN she believes Pompeo is ""derelict in his duty for refusing to speak out about diplomats who are loyally and faithfully and professionally carrying out their responsibilities and who are being slandered by political attacks."" The State Department did not reply to a request for comment about the criticism. "

But that has done little to dispel the public outcry: For weeks, violent mass protests have erupted across the country, leaving at least 22 people dead. ""The good news, at least as I see it, is it's a messy democracy and people are debating it,"" Nadella said Monday. ""It's not something that is hidden. It's something that is being debated actively, but I'm definitely clear on what we stand for and what I stand for.""

""If I had to sort of mirror what happened to me in the US, I hope that's what happens in India,"" he said. Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request from CNN Business for comment. But the company issued statement on Twitter from Nadella, who doubled down on his support for creating equal opportunities for immigrants.

211,CNN,"Male death row inmates in Arizona are currently split between the Florence and Eyman facilities, according to the Arizona Department of Corrections.  Inmates who are currently incarcerated at Florence Prison will be relocated to a combination of county corrections facilities and third-party operators, according to the release. Florence Prison was built by inmates in 1908 as a replacement for the old Territorial Prison at Yuma, the department of corrections website said. The original prison included a death chamber with a trap door where the bodies of those hanged would fall into a room below, according to the website. It is not clear where executions will take place after Florence Prison is closed. The last execution that took place in Arizona was in 2014, when it took 15 lethal injection doses over the course of two hours before Joseph Wood was pronounced dead.  Wood was convicted of murder and assault in the 1989 deaths of his estranged girlfriend and her father."

214,CNN,"US troops knew there was going to be an attack on their base -- they just didn't know what the nature of the attack would be. The Iranian attack on the Al-Asad airbase was one of two on Iraqi military bases housing US troops on Wednesday. The attacks were in retaliation for a drone strike at a Baghdad airport that killed Iran's most powerful military commander, Qasem Soleimani, earlier in the week. President Donald Trump said Soleimani was plotting ""imminent and sinister attacks"" on Americans, though he has been unable to offer a time frame on when this would be.  Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mahdi previously said Iran sent Iraq an official verbal message that an attack ""had begun or would begin shortly,"" on unspecified US military locations. An Arab diplomatic source also told CNN that Iraq gave advance warning to the US on ""which bases would be hit"" after Iranian officials passed on the information. The first strike hit at 1:34 a.m. and after a brief pause of around 15 minutes, the next volley began. Two more volleys of missiles followed over the next two hours. At dawn, officers finally emerged from bunkers to discover the full scale of destruction. Al-Asad airbase  The Al-Asad air base, which houses US troops, is one of the largest and oldest military bases in Iraq. It is located in Anbar province, a hotbed of ISIS activity in western Iraq between 2014 and 2017. Anbar was the birthplace of Sunni extremism in the aftermath of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. In December 2018, Trump visited troops at Al-Asad. ""We came in, we felt very safe coming in. It was a pretty difficult journey in certain ways, but we felt very, very good, very safe,"" Trump said, according to a White House transcript. Vice President Mike Pence visited the base a year later to celebrate Thanksgiving with around 150 service members. The US military presence in Iraq has fluctuated greatly since the 2003 invasion. At its height, the US had 170,000 troops in Iraq. In 2011, former President Barack Obama withdrew US forces from the country. Around 5,000 troops were deployed to Iraq in 2014 at the request of the Iraqi government, seeking US assistance in the fight against ISIS. Troop levels have been roughly the same since."

""And just in case you didn't know it, Ohio just had the best year economically in the history of your state."" It's not clear what measurement Trump is using here. As Seth Richardson of the Cleveland Plain Dealer notes, Ohio actually lost jobs in 2019.  5. ""I signed the largest-ever investments in the United States military, $738 billion, and we created this sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces, the Space Force, and everybody is excited about that."" Mars Awaits! 6. ""We've got new planes, we've got new rockets, new missiles, we've got new everything, and it's either here or coming in."" ""We've got new everything."" -- The President of the United States 7. ""They go home to mommy. They're going home to mommy. They are going home to mommy. It's a beautiful sight. Thank you, security. Do we love law enforcement, by the way?"" This is Trump's response to a protester being escorted out of the rally. And yes, he says the ""go home to mommy"" thing every time. Why? Because, at root, he is a bully. 8. ""So they don't want me to make that decision. They want me to call up, maybe go over there, let me go over to Congress. Or come on over to the White House, let's talk about it."" In which Trump says he can't possibly be asked to seek congressional approval for a military strike -- although the power to declare war lies solely in the hands of Congress. Because, the Constitution. 9. ""We didn't have time to call up Nancy, who is not operating with a full deck."" In which the President suggests the Speaker of the House is operating at some sort of reduced mental capacity. His evidence? Oh, he didn't provide any. 10. ""Nine inches. He buys the smallest shirt collar you can get, and it is loose."" Trump is talking here about the neck circumference of the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Very normal stuff! 11. ""By the way, did you see, I did nothing wrong. They don't even know what the hell is going on."" This is about impeachment. And yes, Donald Trump is only the third president in the history of the country to be impeached by the House. 12. ""That is the way the Academy Awards used to look when it was successful. Then they started hitting us all the time, and it became unsuccessful. I love it. I love it, actually."" So the Academy Awards are no longer successful because, uh, they started attacking Donald Trump? Also, the ratings for the 2019 Academy Awards were up from 2018. So ... 13. ""They write -- if you watched for the last three years, think of it -- and then they get Pulitzer Prizes, but it turned out to be all wrong. How do you do that? They get Pulitzer Prize for being wrong."" [narrator voice] They weren't wrong. 14. ""I made a deal. I saved a country, and I just heard that the head of that country is now getting the Nobel Peace Prize for saving the country. I said, what? Did I have something do with it? Yes."" Trump appears to be referencing the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize winner -- Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. Abiy was chosen for the prize ""for his efforts to achieve peace and international cooperation, and in particular for his decisive initiative to resolve the border conflict with neighboring Eritrea."" Which, I guess, Trump thinks he did and, therefore, should have won the Peace Prize? 15. ""I saved a big war. I saved a couple of them."" So I assume here Trump is counting the conflict with Iran as a ""big war""? Let's, just for the sake of argument, grant that one. What other ""big"" wars has Trump saved us from? 16. ""And nobody has done it like we've done it. And it is we, it is we. It is not me. It is we."" No ""I"" in team!! 17. ""You know, outside, I don't know what this place holds, like 10,000 or 11,000 people, right? Outside you have thousands and thousands of people that want to get in."" This is a common Trump brag that is rarely based in reality.  18. ""But now I have completed more promises than I have made."" [cut to egg-headed scientist] This simply isn't possible. 19. ""Did you ever hear me prior to the election talk about Space Force? I never talked about it. We did Space Force. But did we ever speak about it? No."" Here's how Space Force came about, according to Trump himself in March 2018. ""You know, I was saying it the other day -- because we're doing a tremendous amount of work in space -- I said, 'Maybe we need a new force. We'll call it the Space Force,"" Trump recounted. ""And I was not really serious. And then I said, 'What a great idea. Maybe we'll have to do that.' "" 20. ""He calls me Mr. President. I've known this guy forever. He used to call me, 'Hey, Don, let's go out to dinner.' You know, before, he'll go, 'Hey, let's go out to dinner.' Now he goes, 'Mr. President, sir, how are you?' "" So, you are saying, people call you ""Mr. President"" now that you are President? But they didn't call you that before you were President? Weird! 21. ""So we have the greatest phrase of all time, Make America Great Again, and with all due respect, I'll never end it."" So it's the greatest phrase of all time now, is it? 22. ""So Crooked Hillary -- wait -- Crooked Hillary --you should lock her up, I will tell you."" This comment followed a chant of ""lock her up"" from the crowd. Which is ironic because on Thursday, Trump's Justice Department cleared Clinton of any and all wrongdoing as secretary of state in regard to her work with the Clinton Foundation. 23. ""Oh, I hate to see it."" You do hate to see it. 24. ""You ever see these crazy polls that come out -- we are doing great in the polls, by the way."" In Gallup's most recent poll, 45% approved of how Trump is doing his job, while 51% disapproved. 25. ""We are selling that hat like nobody has ever sold a hat before, I will say. So it's great. Good."" Trump is talking about the ""Make America Great Again"" hats. Or maybe the ""Keep America Great"" hats. Either way, those hats are selling ""like nobody has ever sold a hat before."" 26. ""And he punked out on us, right, this guy."" ""This guy"" appears to be former Ohio Republican Gov. John Kasich, who refused to endorse Trump's 2016 campaign. 27. ""I have a 95% approval rating. Can you believe it?"" I cannot. Mostly because it's not clear to me where Trump is getting this number, which he cites a lot. A Fox News poll conducted last month showed him at 85% approval among Republicans. 28. ""They say, they did a poll on this. I think I remember the numbers. All you know is, we won against Abraham, Honest Abe. We won. Fifty-three to 47, do you believe that? Abraham Lincoln."" This is from a YouGov poll -- and Trump has the numbers right. A majority of Republicans believe he is a better president than Abraham Lincoln. So, well, yeah. 29. ""I don't know if they had polls back then, but Abraham Lincoln -- I always say, I can be more presidential than any candidate that ever ran, than any president, other than maybe Abraham Lincoln when he is wearing his hat."" No words. 30. ""But I like Abe Lincoln, but we are doing well."" Yeah, this all checks out. 31. ""I should watch -- you know, I'm supposed to watch, it's like my job, try and watch. Watch the competition. But it's like watching death."" If you don't think Trump watches the Democratic presidential debates, I have a terrific company named Theranos to tell you about. 32. ""And Biden doesn't know the difference between Iran and Iraq. He has gotten it wrong four times.""  Here's Trump's answer from a 2015 debate when asked about the nuclear triad: ""We have to be extremely vigilant and extremely careful when it comes to nuclear. Nuclear changes the whole ballgame. ... The biggest problem we have is nuclear -- nuclear proliferation and having some maniac, having some madman, go out and get a nuclear weapon. That's in my opinion, that is the single biggest problem that our country faces right now."" Uh huh. 33. ""I said, we have to have -- where is Hunter -- as a witness and they said, what do you mean, where is Hunter? I said, that's his first name. I have now made his first name, where is. Where is Hunter?"" So. Hunter Biden's new name, according to Trump, is ""Where Is Hunter Biden."" OK. 34. ""So where is Hunter? Where the hell are you, Hunter?""  Where's Wallace at? 35. ""And they just called today, five of the most respected people and they said things that were incredible. They said there's never been anything like this in the church that they can remember."" Religious leaders called Trump and told him that ""there's never been anything like this in the church."" And the ""this"" is the excitement for Trump. Yeah. 36. ""It is being shipped all over the world, while every Democrat running for president wants to shut down our coal mines, we are putting our miners back to work. Dig we must. Dig we must."" Trump channels Yoda.   37. ""You know, there is a state known as Texas, and I won Texas by a lot, just like I won Ohio by a lot."" A state known as Texas, you say? Also, Trump won Texas by 9 points in 2016. Mitt Romney won it by 16 points four years earlier. 38. ""And our air and our water right now is cleaner than it's been in 40 years."" ""US air quality is slipping after years of improvement"" -- June 2019 39. ""The steel industry was dead, and now it is vibrant."" Er ... 40. ""And Congressman Van Drew left their party and joined our party. So we've done things that nobody has ever done before, but the Democrats are taking their cues from the socialist Bernie Sanders and that girl."" Uh. I guess ""that girl"" that Trump is referring to is New York's Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez?  41. ""Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the moment of birth."" Flat wrong. 42.  ""I spent two to three hours talking to the people that work there. I looked at some of that hydraulics and I'm -- I love the whole thing, the world of tractors and all of that stuff. I know a lot about it."" Sure you do. 43. ""And I looked at the carvings, I looked at the metal. I looked at how perfect everything was. The turrets, the round, how perfect it fit. They put it on.""

218,CNN,"No American or Iraqi lives were lost, because of the precautions taken, the dispersal of forces, and an early warning system that worked very well. I salute the incredible skill and courage of America's men and women in uniform. For far too long -- all the way back to 1979, to be exact -- nations have tolerated Iran's destructive and destabilizing behavior in the Middle East and beyond. Those days are over. Iran has been the leading sponsor of terrorism, and their pursuit of nuclear weapons threatens the civilized world. We will never let that happen. Last week, we took decisive action to stop a ruthless terrorist from threatening American lives. At my direction, the United States military eliminated the world's top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani. As the head of the Quds Force, Soleimani was personally responsible for some of the absolutely worst atrocities. He trained terrorist armies, including Hezbollah, launching terrorist strikes against civilian targets. He fueled bloody civil wars all across the region. He viciously wounded and murdered thousands of U.S. troops, including the planting of roadside bombs that maim and dismember their victims. Soleimani directed the recent attacks on U.S. personnel in Iraq that badly wounded four servicemembers and killed one American. And he orchestrated the violent assault on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. In recent days, he was planning new attacks on American targets, but we stopped him. Soleimani's hands were drenched in both American and Iranian blood. He should have been terminated long ago. By removing Soleimani, we have sent a powerful message to terrorists: If you value your own life, you will not threaten the lives of our people. As we continue to evaluate options in response to Iranian aggression, the United States will immediately impose additional punishing economic sanctions on the Iranian regime. These powerful sanctions will remain until Iran changes its behavior. In recent months alone, Iran has seized ships in international waters, fired an unprovoked strike on Saudi Arabia, and shot down two U.S. drones. Iran's hostilities substantially increased after the foolish Iran nuclear deal was signed in 2013 and they were given $150 billion, not to mention $1.8 billion in cash. Instead of saying, ""Thank you,"" to the United States, they chanted, ""Death to America."" In fact, they chanted ""Death to America"" the day the agreement was signed. Then Iran went on a terror spree funded by the money from the deal and created hell in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon, Afghanistan and Iraq. The missiles fired last night at us and our allies were paid for with the funds made available by the last administration. The regime also greatly tightened the reins on their own country, even recently killing 1,500 people at the many protests that are taking place all throughout Iran. The very defective JCPOA expires shortly anyway and gives Iran a clear and quick path to nuclear breakout. Iran must abandon its nuclear ambitions and end its support for terrorism. The time has come for the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Russia and China to recognize this reality. They must now break away from the remnants of the Iran deal, or JCPOA, and we must all work together toward making a deal with Iran that makes the world a safer and more peaceful place. We also must make a deal that allows Iran to thrive and prosper and take advantage of its enormous untapped potential. Iran can be a great country. Peace and stability cannot prevail in the Middle East as long as Iran continues to foment violence, unrest, hatred and war. The civilized world must send a clear and unified message to the Iranian regime: Your campaign of terror, murder, mayhem will not be tolerated any longer. It will not be allowed to go forward. Today, I am going to ask NATO to become much more involved in the Middle East process. Over the last three years, under my leadership, our economy is stronger than ever before and America has achieved energy independence. These historic accompliments (sic) change our strategic priorities -- these are accomplishments that nobody thought were possible -- and options in the Middle East became available. We are now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. We are independent, and we do not need Middle East oil. The American military has been completely rebuilt under my administration, at a cost of $2.5 trillion. US armed forces are stronger than ever before. Our missiles are big, powerful, accurate, lethal and fast. Under construction are many hypersonic missiles. The fact that we have this great military and equipment, however, does not mean we have to use it. We do not want to use it. American strength, both military and economic, is the best deterrent. Three months ago, after destroying 100 percent of ISIS and its territorial caliphate, we killed the savage leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, who was responsible for so much death, including the mass beheadings of Christians, Muslims and all who stood in his way. He was a monster. Al-Baghdadi was trying again to rebuild the ISIS caliphate and failed. Tens of thousands of ISIS fighters have been killed or captured during my administration. ISIS is a natural enemy of Iran. The destruction of ISIS is good for Iran and we should work together on this and other shared priorities. Finally, to the people and leaders of Iran, we want you to have a future -- and a great future, one that you deserve, one of prosperity and home and harmony with the nations of the world. The United States is ready to embrace peace with all who seek it. I want to thank you and God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you."

Erbil base is in Kurdistan The military base in Erbil, also targeted by Iran on Wednesday morning, also houses US troops. It is located in the semi-autonomous Kurdish region of Iraq, run by the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), which is a strong ally of the US. The US worked closely with Kurdish Peshmerga fighters in the fight against ISIS. After Iran fired more than dozen ballistic missiles on Wednesday morning, Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said on Twitter the attack was ""targeting base from which cowardly armed attack against our citizens & senior officials were launched,"" apparently referring to the killing of Soleimani. It is unclear if the two bases played any role in the US attack. There were no initial reports of any US casualties in either of the Iranian attacks Wednesday, but an assessment of the impact of the strikes is underway, a US official told CNN.  Iraqi security officials told CNN there were no casualties among Iraqi security forces, after an earlier preliminary report from an Iraqi security source indicated there were Iraqi casualties. 5,000 US troops in Iraq On Sunday, Iraq's Parliament voted to expel US troops. Iran-backed Shia paramilitaries have repeatedly called for the ""immediate withdrawal"" of US forces, since the US attack. Over the weekend, they called on Iraqi security forces to keep a distance of at least 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) from US bases, and warned Iraqis about turning into ""human shields."" In Baghdad, Iraqis have been concerned about getting sucked into an escalating proxy war between the US and Iran. Caretaker Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mahdi has said the withdrawal of US troops would be the only ""way out"" of further violence in Iraq. On Tuesday, Trump said he intends to pull US troops out of Iraq, but not immediately.  ""I think we've done a fantastic job, but eventually we want to be able to let Iraq run their own affairs,"" Trump said in the Oval Office. ""And that's very important. We want to get out, but this isn't the right point."" The US military presence in Iraq has fluctuated greatly since the 2003 invasion. At its height, the US had 170,000 troops in Iraq. In 2011, former President Barack Obama withdrew US forces from the country. In 2014, around 5,000 troops were deployed to Iraq at the request of the Iraqi government who sought US assistance in the fight against ISIS. Troop levels have been roughly the same since."

224,CNN,"In 1977, Turley's favorite movie was ""Planet of the Apes."" His favorite snack was Funyuns. His favorite pastime was riding his BMX bike and doing wheelies down the street. His best buddy was Steve, who lived in the same neighborhood in Santa Monica, California. Steve was joining the Boy Scouts and encouraged Turley to join with him. Turley signed up. He met the scoutmaster, who called himself Michael Ross.   But Turley needed one more thing: a uniform. He had no idea that not having one would be the beginning of the end of his innocence. Turley's parents hadn't bought him a uniform, so he was relieved when his scoutmaster said he had some used ones available. But there was one caveat. ""In order to get one of those uniforms, you had to go over to his apartment and change,"" Turley said. He says the scoutmaster told him not to be shy. ""We're all guys here. It's OK. You can change in front of me,"" Turley remembered the scoutmaster saying. Turley said as he tried on the uniform, the scoutmaster suddenly thrust his hands down Turley's pants, saying he was just trying to help him get the right fit. Instead, he says the man he knew as Ross kept touching his genitals. ""I left there just sort of stunned,"" Turley said. He rode his bike home, just a few blocks away, and then stayed silent. ""I just put it into the back of my mind and tried to forget it."" That first time would be followed by two more, uncomfortable, awful sessions of unwanted touching, Turley said. It turned out that the scoutmaster of Troop 222 in Santa Monica was a fugitive from the state of New York, where he was wanted on child molestation charges, according to a 1977 Santa Monica police report. Between 1960 and 1971, this same man had been arrested in New York for ""nine offenses relating to child molest(ation), including sodomy,"" the report said. READ THE FILE And his name wasn't Michael Ross -- the name he registered with the Boy Scouts of America. His name at birth was Alan Hirsch Grossman, but he later legally changed it to Alan David Peter Bagration, court documents show. Previous allegations of child sex abuse Turley had no idea of his scoutmaster's history until Michael Ross' name made the local paper. He remembers the phone ringing before school. It was his best friend.  ""Steve called me. He said, 'You've got to hear this.' And he read me an article about the scoutmaster being arrested for child molestation,"" Turley said. A few days later, he was called to the principal's office at school. The FBI had obtained permission from his mother to interview him. Turley said the agents were nice, but he couldn't help feeling intimidated. Had he done something wrong, Turley wondered?  So he lied to the FBI, not wanting to admit what had happened. ""I was just shocked about it, and a bit scared I think,"" Turley said.  Other children did come forward to the Santa Monica police. In handwritten statements, the disturbing details of their accusations are spelled out. Some boys told police they were molested orally and anally, and that Ross had taken nude pictures of them, according to court documents.  Investigators also obtained photographic slides showing children being molested in what was purported to be the scoutmaster's previous residence in Venice, California, according to the Santa Monica police report. Ross, who was around 40 at the time, was charged with several counts of child molestation, and eventually pleaded guilty to three of the charges, which involved three boys under the age of 14.  ""I think that Mr. Bagration's history of criminal behavior does furnish a sound basis for the belief that he is a compulsive pedophiliac and if allowed his freedom would again prey on young boys,"" said Judge Charles Woodmansee, according to a transcript of the proceeding on November 3, 1977. Ross was sentenced to prison ""for the term prescribed by law,"" the transcript said, but was paroled in 1981. His parole was suspended for a violation and he was arrested in 1995, sent to prison and released later that year, according to court documents.  Following his arrest in 1977, memos were flying between the local Boy Scouts field director and Boy Scouts Headquarters about the scoutmaster they had allowed to head Troop 222. In one of them, sent on May 4, 1977 -- a week after Ross was arrested -- the field director recounted a discussion he had with a Los Angeles police officer investigating the case, according to the field director's memo.  The officer suggested that the Boy Scouts should have known about problems with Ross two years previously, when they were told by a person whose name was blacked out in a copy of the memo and by a local school principal about issues they had with him. The field director said they had asked to get a signed complaint of any charges that were made against Ross, but they never received a complaint so no action could be taken at that time. By July, a Boy Scouts of America file marked ""confidential record sheet"" shows they obtained a record showing Ross, under his real name, had three convictions -- all for child molestation -- between 1960-1971.  Parents were informed Ross would no longer be scout leader two days after he was arrested on the child molestation charges. But Turley said that was too little, too late. He is among dozens of former scouts initiating lawsuits against several as of now unnamed defendants. As for Turley's alleged abuser, New Jersey death records show that a man matching his birth name and birth date died in 2017 at the age of 84. A growing number of 'look back' laws across the country The suit comes as the result of a new law in California that suspends the statute of limitations to report allegations of childhood sexual abuse or file a lawsuit during a three-year window that began on January 1. It also allows victims to file civil lawsuits until age 40, or five years from the time the abuse was discovered. But California's new law also requires a court order to approve naming the Boy Scouts of America or any other possible defendant in decades old allegations. The court has not yet ruled on whether to add the organization as a defendant to Turley's suit.  Attorneys for Turley say the Boy Scouts have known they have had a problem for years. In the lawsuit filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, the suit says, the Boy Scouts kept so-called ""perversion files"" on potential sexual predators who were in the organization going back decades.  ""The Boy Scouts routinely turned a blind eye to people just like Michael Ross all across the state of California. And they enabled these perverts to abuse these children time and time again,"" said attorney Spencer Lucas of Panish, Shea & Boyle, who represents Turley. The law firm says it has 25 other clients also suing the Boy Scouts of America (BSA). The organization sent CNN this statement, in which it apologizes for anyone harmed during their time in scouting. ""The BSA has taken significant steps over many years to ensure that we respond aggressively and effectively to reports of sexual abuse. We believe victims and remove individuals based on only allegations of inappropriate behavior. We recognize, however, that there were some instances in our organization's history when cases were not addressed in a manner consistent with our commitment to protect Scouts, the values of our organization, and the procedures we have in place today."" The organization also addressed questions about the ""perversion files,"" saying that its files have been misrepresented over the years. Before modern criminal background checks, the BSA said it maintained files to prevent individuals accused of abusing youth from re-entering their programs. California is one of the latest states to implement these so-called look back laws. This year, North Carolina opened a two-year window for victims of childhood sex crimes to file civil claims against their alleged abusers. In 2019, New Jersey did the same, while New York removed its statute of limitations for child sex abuse victims to file claims for a one-year window. In all, eight states and Washington, D.C., have passed ""look back"" laws since 2018, according to an Associated Press report.  The move ushered in hundreds of lawsuits against organizations such as schools and the Catholic Church, as well as individuals such as the now-deceased multimillionaire and convicted pedophile, Jeffrey Epstein.   While some of the organizations implicated shudder at the potential financial destruction that could befall their institutions, accusers say this is their chance to right past wrongs. More important, Turley says, is the ultimate goal of keeping other children safe from sexual predators lurking in organizations such as the Boy Scouts. ""How dare they be reckless with children. That is just not forgivable. That cannot happen again,"" Turley said."
225,CNN,"Trump has long seemed to relish reciting lurid stories about the horrors of illegal immigration. During a barrage of immigration-related false claims in January, as he sought public support for the government shutdown over funding for his border wall, he came up with a vivid new tale about the logistics of human trafficking. ""And they'll have women taped -- their mouths with duct tape, with electrical tape. They tape their face, their hair, their hands behind their back, their legs. They put them in the backseat of cars and vans, and they go -- they don't come in through your port of entry because you'd see them. You couldn't do that,"" he said during a January 14 speech to the American Farm Bureau Federation. ""They come in through our border, where we don't have any barriers or walls.""    While it's possible some women are being made to suffer such kidnapping horrors, the policy premise of Trump's ""duct tape"" novellas -- that trafficking victims are never transported through legal ports of entry, only through the unprotected desert -- is not at all true. February: Imaginary voter fraud  Trump has depicted himself as a crusader against election fraud. What happened in February was telling. On February 21, North Carolina's elections board ordered a new congressional election in the state's ninth district because of an actual case of apparent election fraud -- allegedly perpetrated by a Republican operative who was indicted the following week. On February 22, Trump was asked for his thoughts and he quickly pivoted to imaginary election fraud in another state. ""Well, I condemn any election fraud,"" he said. ""And when I look at what's happened in California with the votes, when I look at what happened -- as you know, there was just a case where they found a million fraudulent votes...""  Trump's lying is rarely challenged in real time. This time, a reporter did try to object to the fiction about California. Trump responded with a favorite tactic: an aggressive ""Excuse me, excuse me"" interjection, then more dishonesty. March: Revisionist history on ""Russia, if you're listening"" Nearly three years after Trump made his infamous ""Russia, if you're listening"" campaign request for help obtaining deleted Hillary Clinton emails, he announced a new explanation. He had been just kidding. The media had failed to report that he had been just kidding. ""Because with the fake news -- if you tell a joke, if you're sarcastic, if you're having fun with the audience, if you're on live television with millions of people and 25,000 people in an arena, and if you say something like, 'Russia, please, if you can, get us Hillary Clinton's emails. Please, Russia, please. Please get us the emails. Please!'... So everybody is having a good time. I'm laughing, we're all having fun. And then that fake CNN and others say, 'He asked Russia to go get the emails. Horrible.' ...These people are sick,"" he told the Conservative Political Action Conference on March 2.  No, Trump didn't make the request before 25,000 people at a rollicking arena event. No, he wasn't laughing at the time. Trump made his plea at a 2016 press conference, with a straight face. He offered no indication that he was anything less than serious.  This was up-is-down fake history, one of Trump's periodic efforts to rewrite a reality we were all able to witness. April: ""Windmills"" and cancer   Trump, who has tilted at windmills for more than a decade, made perhaps his strangest claim on the subject at a National Republican Congressional Committee fundraiser on April 2.  ""Wind. If you -- if you have a windmill anywhere near your house, congratulations, your house just went down 75% in value. And they say the noise causes cancer,"" he said. There might indeed be a ""they"" Trump has heard saying that wind turbines -- which he habitually calls ""windmills"" -- cause cancer. That should not mean the President should pass on their false claim to the country. But Trump is not only a serial liar but a serial sharer of inaccurate information he has heard from a motley collection of dubious sources -- ""many people,"" ""some people,"" ""they"" -- and not bothered to verify.  May: Two lies in one  Trump has been lying about Veterans Choice since 2018, falsely claiming he was the one who got it passed. His rendition on May 30, along with a similar claim in March, might have been the most egregious. ""I disagree with John McCain on the way he handled the vets, because I said you got to get Choice. He was never able to get Choice. I got Choice,"" Trump told reporters.  This was a double lie. In addition to taking his usual unearned credit for a program that President Barack Obama signed into law in 2014, Trump used his non-accomplishment as a cudgel against a deceased foe whose accomplishment it really was. McCain, in fact, was a key author of the Choice bill.  What Trump signed in 2018 was the VA MISSION Act, a law that expanded and modified the Choice program. The full name of the VA MISSION Act honors McCain: it is the John S. McCain III, Daniel K. Akaka, and Samuel R. Johnson VA Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks Act of 2018.  June: Remains, no longer returning  Trump had a real diplomatic success to boast about in 2018. North Korea had returned the remains of some of the American soldiers who were killed in the Korean War.  In 2019, as the diplomacy soured, North Korea ceased cooperating. Trump's solution: lie that North Korea was still cooperating, thus giving false hope to hundreds of American families. ""We've had, as you know, the remains of the heroes, our great heroes from many years ago -- that's coming back, and coming back as they find them, as they find the sites and the graves, and they're sending them back,"" he told reporters on June 25, just five days before he met with dictator Kim Jong Un at the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).  We thought at first that it was possible Trump just didn't know what was going on, since the Pentagon had only announced the suspension of the program in May. But, in mid-June, Trump was told by an interviewer that ""the remains have stopped coming back.""  He responded, ""But they will be. Look, we've gotten remains back. That will start up again."" He then continued speaking as if it had not stopped at all. July: Smearing Rep. Ilhan Omar   There just aren't many lies you can tell about a Muslim politician that are more incendiary than a lie that they'd said al Qaeda makes them proud. But here's what Trump said about Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar at a North Carolina campaign rally on July 17, wrongly describing remarks she had made in a 2013 interview: ""Omar laughed that Americans speak of al Qaeda in a menacing tone and remarked that, 'You don't say America with this intensity. You say al Qaeda -- makes you proud. Al Qaeda makes you proud. You don't speak that way about America.'""  Trump continued his smear campaign against the Minnesota congresswoman later the same week, falsely claiming that Omar had used the phrase ""evil Jews."" In September, he shared a Twitter video that falsely claimed Omar had been dancing in celebration on the anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.  August: A tariff mantra  Between July 8, when we started counting Trump's false claims at CNN, and December 15, the day until which we currently have comprehensive data, Trump's most frequent false claim of any kind was that China is paying the entirety of the cost of his tariffs on imported Chinese products. ""We're not paying for the tariffs; China is paying for the tariffs, for the 100th time,"" he told reporters in one typical remark on August 18. ""And I understand tariffs very well. Other countries, it may be that if I do things with other countries -- but in the case of China, China is eating the tariffs, at least so far.""   His assertion has been contradicted by numerous tariff-paying American companies and by multiple economic studies. But Trump said it on 49 separate occasions over those five months. And he said it 20 times in August alone, more than he did in any other month, as he faced scrutiny over his intensifying trade war.  September: The Sharpie fiasco This credibility disaster would have been a one-day story if Trump had just acknowledged that his initial tweet was a mistake -- that, as the National Weather Service office in Birmingham, Alabama tweeted soon afterward, Alabama was not thought to be at greater risk from Hurricane Dorian than initially thought.  Trump preferred to lie than to admit error. His thoroughly deceitful multi-day effort to convince people that he had never been wrong about Alabama culminated in one of the most revealing images of the Trump era: the President of the United States displaying a Sharpie-altered map, which we could all see had been Sharpie-altered, as supposed evidence in his favor.  We counted 12 false claims from Trump on Dorian and Alabama over 11 days. Not including the Sharpie map.  October: Inverting reality on the whistleblower The Sharpie madness was old news by the end of September. Trump's dealings with Ukraine, and Democrats' related impeachment push, were his most frequent subject of dishonesty in all four weeks of October. His most frequent individual false claim on Ukraine or impeachment was that the whistleblower who complained about his dealings with Ukraine was highly inaccurate. He said this on 46 separate occasions through December 15.  ""They heard a whistleblower who came out with a false story -- you know, people say, 'Oh, it was always fairly close.' It wasn't close at all. What the whistleblower said bore no relationship to what the call was,"" he said in one representative comment on October 9.  What did the whistleblower get wrong? Trump never explained in detail. He couldn't have: the whistleblower's primary allegations were proven correct, several of them by the rough transcript Trump himself released. But Trump just kept repeating his ""false story"" mantra over and over -- banking, as usual, on his ability to turn a lie into gospel among his supporters no matter how many times fact-checkers debunked it. Trump first made a version of this claim at the end of September, but he repeated it on 30 separate occasions in October alone as Democrats moved toward impeachment. That was 17 more times than he uttered any other individual false claim that month.  November: Pulling ""out"" of Syria   Trump has to be egregiously inaccurate to get fact-checked by Fox News morning show ""Fox & Friends,"" but his November 22 lie about the troops qualified. When Trump claimed he had ""just pulled out of Syria,"" co-host Brian Kilmeade responded, ""You have 600 guys there, right?"" (The military had said at the time that perhaps 600 troops would remain in northeast Syria, plus another 100-plus troops in southern Syria.)  What Trump had decided in October, after a phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, was both to withdraw US troops from a Kurdish-held part of Syria that Turkey wanted to invade and to deploy US troops to protect oil fields in eastern Syria. The net result was a decline in the US troop presence in Syria, but -- as Kilmeade of all people noted -- not an actual pullout from the country.  Trump's claim on Fox & Friends was not a one-time slip. In October, when there were still about 1,000 soldiers in Syria, Trump said, ""Look, we have no soldiers in Syria. We've won. We've beat ISIS. And we've beat them badly and decisively. We have no soldiers.""  December: Dishwashers  The President of the United States said this: ""Dishwashers -- we did the dishwasher, right? You press it -- remember the dishwasher, you'd press it, boom, there'd be like an explosion, five minutes later you open it up, the steam pours out, the dishes. Now, you press it 12 times. Women tell me. Again, you know, they give you four drops of water. And they're in places where there's so much water, they don't know what to do with it. So we just came out with a reg on dishwashers -- we're going back to you. By the way, by the time they press it 10 times, you spend more on water -- and electric! Don't forget. The whole thing is worse because you're spending all that money on electric. So we're bringing back standards that are great.""  Trump's nonsense-rambling about home appliances lends itself to dismissive mockery, but it's worth taking it seriously. This was the President using two not-even-close-to-true premises -- that modern dishwashers require 10 or 12 button-presses to start and that modern dishwashers use more water and electricity than older dishwashers -- to justify a deregulation push that will do damage to the environment."
226,CNN,"He added: ""Fortunately, however, I need not strike that balance today!"" The House had withdrawn their subpoena for Kupperman's testimony in November, writing in a court case, ""The subpoena at issue in this matter has been withdrawn and there is no current intention to reissue it."" Despite his relatively short tenure, Kupperman had initially drawn the interest of House investigators who believed he had first-hand knowledge of Trump's decisions regarding Ukraine that have come under scrutiny in the impeachment investigation.  Specifically, Kupperman was listening in on the July 25 phone call when, according to a White House transcript, Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. Yet the White House sent a letter to Kupperman directing him not to comply with the subpoena he received from the House committees and maintaining that he would be protected by ""constitutional immunity."" A longtime associate of former national security adviser John Bolton, Kupperman served in several positions in the Reagan administration and subsequently served as a space operations executive at Lockheed Martin and in Boeing's missile defense sector. This story has been updated with additional background on the case."
227,CNN,"The Wall Street Journal was the first to report that Ulrich Brechbuhl, a key aide to Pompeo, told Taylor that Pompeo wanted him to hand over responsibilities in early January, before the top US diplomat arrived, and that Taylor understood Pompeo didn't want to be photographed with him during his visit.  Taylor will step down from his post and leave Ukraine on January 2, two sources familiar with his plans tell CNN. The exact dates of Pompeo's visit have not been made public. Although Taylor's appointment expires in early January, the State Department could have tried to extend his stay in Kiev, but sources tell CNN there was no effort to do so despite the vacuum his departure will create in US leadership on relations with Ukraine at a particularly fraught time. The State Department did not reply to requests for comment on Taylor's tenure, his departure or explain who would follow him as top US diplomat in Ukraine. Critics in Congress expressed alarm at reports that Taylor would be returning to the US. Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat, accused Trump of seeking retribution. ""Bill Taylor shouldn't be punished for doing the right thing,"" Swalwell told CNN a day after the House held its historic vote to impeach the President. ""We're in the position we're in today,"" Swalwell said, because ""people like ... Bill Taylor, did the right thing."" ""They stood up, the President got caught, Ukraine got the aid, and the lesson I take from that is, when you stand up to the President you stop his corruption."" Taylor, career diplomat and military veteran, came out of retirement earlier this year to take on duties in the embassy after Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch was abruptly recalled to Washington at the President's direction.  'A snake pit'  Taylor testified about his concerns about taking the post in Kiev in the wake of Yovanovitch's unexpected removal in May after a smear campaign led by the President's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.  ""I was concerned that there was, I think I put it, a snake pit in Kiev and a snake pit here, and I was not sure that I could usefully serve in that context,"" Taylor said, according to the transcript.  Taylor had served as the US ambassador to Ukraine from 2006 to 2009, but at the time he was asked to take over at the embassy, he had retired from the Foreign Service and was serving as executive vice president at the US Institute of Peace, a nonpartisan think tank.  Pompeo had to convince Taylor to take the job, a move the top US diplomat may regret if he runs for Senate and seeks the backing of the President's supporters. Pompeo has made multiple trips to Kansas this year and recently launched a personal Twitter account that features posts about his dog Sherman, farmers, football and the military. Since Taylor's testimony, Trump has repeatedly made the unfounded claim that the former ambassador is a ""Never Trumper,"" first leveling the charge in an October tweet. The President repeated it to a gaggle of reporters on the White House lawn. ""Here's the problem,"" Trump said, referring to Taylor. ""He's a Never Trumper."" Taylor has been widely described as a respected and apolitical public servant who has served in both Republican and Democratic administrations.   Kurt Volker, the former special representative to Ukraine, left his post earlier this year when the Ukraine controversy began. And those who are still tending to the relationship do not have the political vote of confidence from the Trump administration."
228,CNN,"Russia announced the testing of the Avangard missile system back in 2018, when Putin called the system ""invulnerable"" due to its ability to evade US defenses. It has also openly stated it is developing underwater hypersonic drones. But US military analysts have been skeptical of Russia's claimed military capabilities surrounding hypersonic missile systems. The country has also seen significant setbacks, including a deadly accident earlier this year at a military test range. Earlier this week, Putin boasted of his country's ""unique"" advances in hypersonic weaponry, saying other countries were ""trying to catch up with us."" Speaking at a Russian Defense Ministry board meeting, Putin added that ""not a single country possesses hypersonic weapons, let alone continental-range hypersonic weapons,"" according to a transcript released by the Kremlin on Tuesday. According to TASS, US inspection officials were shown the latest developments from the Avangard missile system in late November in accordance with the New START Treaty. Like Russia, the US and China are working on hypersonic projects. Beijing said in August that it had successfully tested a hypersonic aircraft, while the US Air Force awarded a contract to Lockheed Martin to develop a missile earlier this year."

230,CNN,"On Sunday, Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, again sought to dismiss allegations that the administration held up the aid in exchange for the country investigating Trump's political opponent, telling Fox News ""there were two reasons that we held up the aid ... the first one was the rampant corruption in Ukraine."" He also said the aid was withheld because the administration was concerned about how much other countries were giving in aid to Ukraine.  But Democrats -- who have launched an impeachment inquiry into the matter -- argue that a White House transcript of a July phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian President shows that Trump conditioned the release of the aid on Ukraine investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and looking into an unsubstantiated theory that Ukraine, not Russia, was responsible for hacking Democratic Party emails in 2016. Trump has denied doing anything improper, and there is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden or his son, whose ties to a Ukrainian gas company have been the focus of Trump's allegations of corruption. Rachel Semmel, a spokeswoman for the Office of Management and Budget, told the Post in a statement that Trump ""has consistently sought across-the-board cuts to foreign aid, and has proposed more cuts in his budgets than any other president in history.""  ""He has also strongly encouraged other countries to contribute their own efforts and resources to their defense and reform efforts,"" Semmel told the Post. "
231,CNN,"But analysts have in the past expressed caution that Russia's boasts about its military capabilities are not often backed up. And the country has also seen significant setbacks, including a deadly accident earlier this year at a military test range.

On Tuesday, an advanced Russian Su-57 fighter crashed during a test flight in the Khabarovsk region, Russian state news agencies reported. State news agency TASS cited military industry officials as saying that a preliminary investigation concluded the crash was caused by a technical failure of the aircraft control system.
