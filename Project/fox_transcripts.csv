1,FOX,"New poll reveals more Americans are losing confidence in the press. A new poll on the reliability of journalists comes from The Pew Charitable Trusts, which makes sense, because it stinks for the press. Less than half of Americans have a great deal of confidence in the news media. I wonder why. Anchors and guests on MSNBC, CNN, NBC and elsewhere have been predicting the end of the Trump presidency and making unsupported claims about the president for years, including false claims about allegations of Trump collusion with Russia.  Americans rank the press behind lawyers and above elected officials. That’s like saying you're worse than vermin but not as bad as lice. GUTFELD ON ANOTHER MEDIA HYSTERIA But the numbers would've been worse were it not for Fox News. The reason: we’re awesome. Which is why the other guys hate us so much. It seems like other cable networks exist just to watch Fox. Over and over again, you hear people at MSNBC and CNN talking about what was aired on Fox News. My God, what if we stopped working? CNN would have to actually cover news. But then, who could they blame everything on? On CNN, Chris Cuomo complained about President Trump not wearing a mask when he was out in public and said of the president: “Everyone around him has a mask on. Now, he doesn't because he wants to keep up the Fox farce, this BS that COVID-19's overrated. I guess the anti-elitists over there are OK with 10,000 more dead.” What a child. So this guy has the gall to blame us for future death. What about death that already happened. That is, the actual thousands of people in rest homes he failed to ask his brother – New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo – about because he had other things on his mind? For example, in an interview with Gov. Cuomo, Chris Cuomo asked: “Do you think you are an attractive person now because you’re single and ready to mingle? Do you really think you are some desirable single person, and that this is not just people’s pain coming out of them?” Andrew Cuomo replied: “I think beauty is in the eye of the beholder.” And 5,200 people died in rest homes. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Anyway, the Pew poll suggests the media don't act on behalf of the public. Probably because they dislike the public. The press is over-educated, cloistered, far removed from people who make things. Their idea of slumming it is non-organic quinoa. I wonder: if the media became truly diverse – especially in perspective – would they have gotten so much wrong? Would they have missed Trump's victory, or seen through the collusion and obstruction hoax, the impeachment travesty? CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Would they have seen the coronavirus coming instead of drooling over Rep. Adam Schiff's lies? Would they have seen former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn for what he was: a hero getting screwed? The fact is, we know the media are broken, and the only entity not reporting it is the media. We need a 12-step program for the press; the first one would be to buy them a mirror.

2,FOX," This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" May 13, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Juan Williams, along with Dana Perino, Greg Gutfeld, Jesse Watters, and Emily Compagno. It is 5:00 in New York City, and this is THE FIVE. Major breaking news today surrounding the unmasking of Michael Flynn, we're awaiting reaction from President Trump and we'll bring that to you very soon. GOP senators releasing the names of key Obama administration officials who may have received the identity of Flynn after it was unmasked.  On the list, former Vice President, Joe Biden, former FBI Director, James Comey, and former Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper. The list also includes President Obama's former chief of staff, Dennis McDonough. Joe Biden was asked about this yesterday about the Flynn investigation. Take a look at what he said.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I know nothing about those most (ph) investigate Michael Flynn. I thought you asked me whether or not I had anything to do with him being prosecuted, I'm sorry. I was aware that there was -- they asked for an investigation, but that is all I know about it. And I don't think anything else.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: Senator Rand Paul was one of the first Republicans to react. Take a look at what he's saying.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You remember there was a whole to do about trying to impeach the president, saying using they were using power of government to go after a political opponent. This is a smoking gun if there ever was one that Vice President Biden was using the power of government, abusing that power to go after a political opponent.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: Dana, I wanted to start with you. You heard Senator Paul say this is a smoking gun. But I was thinking, you know, isn't it the case that, you know, any administration's top officials given Russian interference in 2016 election, would want to know who is talking to the Russian ambassador, telling them, you know, don't worry about sanctions intended to punish Russia, just take it easy. Wouldn't you think that is normal?  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, that might be what they decide to say. And I think that, you know, that Hillary Clinton campaign, they still maintain that the Obama administration did not do enough to stop Russian interference. But I think that this horse has now left the barn. And the Obama administration people have been very quiet about this part of the investigation, but very much willing to talk on the record, on Twitter, wherever else they could, about the Russia investigation leading up to impeachment.  I think they're going to have to answer some questions. I mean, some of these things are curious. Like, I think that there is -- some make sense that you could imagine that the director of national intelligence, the CIA, like, that makes sense. But why would ambassador to Italy and the Republic of San Marino need to know the identity of this person in this document?  There -- seems to me there's a lot of people on here that would not even necessarily be in a need-to-know basis, but more like a want-to-know basis. Now, asking for the unmasked -- asking for his name to be unmasked, apparently that might be within the rules of what they can do. But now, we get to the next question, which is, what happened after that? Who leaked the name?  And that will be something that perhaps we can get to the bottom of as we start to go through these names, and we'll maybe start to hear from some of them, Clapper, Brennan, Powers. The only name that's not on here that I thought would be is Susan Rice.  WILLIAMS: Yeah, I agree with you. All right, Jesse, does this mean that people like Samantha Power, Joe Biden, Dennis McDonough, that they somehow were telling Flynn, oh, talk to the Russian ambassador about sanctions. Go right ahead. Did they get him involved? Does this explain or justify his actions?  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: I have no idea what you mean by that, Juan. And I want to correct something you said earlier. You said that these were conservations he was having with Russians. No, they were unmasking every single conversation he had with anybody. I mean, he had basically one conversation with one Russian, so let's just make sure that is very clear.  He is allowed to talk to whoever he wants as the incoming National Security Advisor. And he should be able to do that without being literally spied on by the Obama people. Now, here is the deal. Was there a legitimate reason for all of these Obama officials to unmask an incoming National Security Advisor after the election?  In my opinion, no, they were searching for a reason to take the guy out, because they couldn't have Flynn as National Security Advisor, because he would find out what they had been up to during the campaign and he would ruin the insurance policy. So here is how it all works. January 5th, President Obama's chief of staff unmasks Flynn and sees this conversation with the Russian ambassador.  They have the Oval Office meeting on the 5th of January, with James Comey, with Joe Biden. And that's when Comey and Barack Obama hatched this sting to nail Flynn on this BS Logan Act. Then, a week later, January 12th, Joe Biden himself allegedly unmasks Flynn or gets the Flynn request to unmask. And on that same day, January 12th, Ignatius writes the column in the Washington Post, which reports an illegal leak of the conversation, so the timing is very suspicious.  They don't -- Biden says he doesn't know anything about this. That is obviously not true. He has his fingerprints all over it. So the question is, why were they doing this, how they did it. And like Dana said, it may not be illegal to unmask someone, although, you know, you are doing it without a warrant. It is very sketchy. But to criminally leak the classified conversation, that is exactly what Durham is looking into.  So all of these names on the lists, they are now the subject of a criminal leak investigation. And at this point, we found out more dirt from Barack Obama in three weeks than they found on Donald Trump in three years.  WILLIAMS: Wow. Hey, Greg, you know, I'm not a cynic, as you well know. I'm not a cynic. But I do hear cynics questioning the timing of this release with so many Americans going through the pandemic, suffering and dying. So I wanted to ask you, what would you say to the cynics?  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: I would say who are they? I don't really -- I don't respond to people -- the sum of people who say things. I respond to the people who specifically say things. I do think it is pretty weird that in an era when we're telling people to wear masks, we're doing a story about unmasking people, which to me is proof that we are definitely living in a simulation for that story to happen now.  I think we could ask Joe Biden what did he know and when did he know it. But he would just say tapioca pudding and Shetland pony, so it's pointless. He's going to make a terrible witness. What I find interesting, though, with Juan's question, you're seeing an interesting reversal of liberals, who always seem legitimately concerned about coercion by authorities, setups by authorities, no Miranda Rights being read or pretending not to be investigated a person until they finally get the guy.  You know, the FBI did that with Flynn. They told him don't worry about a lawyer. They said, you know, we're not targeting you. They didn't read his Miranda Rights. And then what they did was they ruined him. They targeted him. They ruined him legally and financially, so essentially they set him up. So I don't know why liberals don't defend him the way they defend others.  Maybe it is racism. Maybe they see Flynn as old, white male who served his country, right? He's not considered oppressed by their definition or by your definition, so it is not really an injustice. He's just a symbol of American oppression, so who cares? Now, I have a question and it might be a really stupid question, but I'm going to ask it anyway, and because we have a lawyer, Emily here.  Now, we have confirmed that this is a three-year charade. It was a phony process of re-litigating something that didn't happen. The person behind that was Adam Schiff. We now know that Schiff lied every step of the way. So could somebody sue to reverse the impeachment when we now know that the impeachment was a house of cards? See, I know you are laughing.  Because I admit, it might be a dumb question. I don't know. But we now know the whole impeachment thing was a circus. It was a circus, so can --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: I don't agree.  GUTFELD: Can somebody sue to reverse the process? Peel that band-aid off or whatever.  WILLIAMS: Well, I think it is all politics. I think it is all politics. But why don't we give Emily the chance to chime in here? And then I have a question for you, Emily.  EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS HOST: Right. Well, as I always say, you can always sue everyone, and the question is whether you are going to succeed or whether it is going to be thrown out. The president himself can appeal that, actually. I think, though, politically, he would do better to wear it like a star on his chest to prove the ridiculousness of it.  Because he was impeached, but he was not convicted, so he still remains in the Oval Office, and likely will enjoy another four years. Juan, if I -- do you want to me the question, because I would like to share my thoughts on this situation, if I can.  WILLIAMS: OK.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: So Emily, can we just take a break for a second? No, Emily, hold on a second. I just want to take a break for a second, because we have some tape of President Trump in conversation with Maria Bartiromo about the Flynn case. Take a look.  COMPAGNO: Got it.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: They weren't after General Flynn. They wanted him to lie about me, make up a story. And with few exceptions, nobody did that. There were many people. I watched K. T. McFarland the other day. I watched where she was -- knock, knock, FBI. You know, the FBI, OK? This was all Obama. This was all Biden. These people were corrupt. The whole thing was corrupt. And we caught them. We caught them.  And what you saw just now, I watched Biden yesterday. He could barely speak. He was on Good Morning America, right? And he said he didn't know anything about it. And now it just gets released right after he said that. It gets released that he was one of the un-maskers, meaning he knew everything about it. So he lied to your friend, George Stephanopoulos.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: So Emily, you see that the president saying this was really about getting him and, of course, the names have come out from the DNI, the Director of National Intelligence, Ric Grenell, he's not been confirmed by the Senate. In fact, the president didn't even put his name up for confirmation. So is this what -- I mean this is so political at this juncture, is this what the founders intended?  That some guy who is now sitting in the director of national intelligence office just puts out these names and stirs a controversy --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: You have to be clear, Emily. Emily, before you answer, like, if there is a fine point to be made here, Ric Grenell's office did not actually release the names, the office of Ron Johnson, the senator was the one that released it. I mean, that is a fine point, but it's one that needs to be made.  WILLIAMS: Yeah, but they got it out. Right, but they put it out. Anyway, go ahead, Emily.  COMPAGNO: I would urge everyone actually not to view this through the lens of politics, just for a moment. To actually disregard for one moment, Obama and Biden's intimate involvement in the post Carter Page flurry and to view this through the lens of government power. And the notion that we have so many current laws right now that can become like blowfish with the amount of government power that can turn into abuse.  Because the government is made up of people, its members, so the FISA court, that much of this was based on, that standard is probable cause. You were communicating with a foreign government. But the Constitution demands that is probable cause you are committing a crime. So I think viewers and all of us should ask ourselves what kind of government do we want.  Do we want one that is bound by the Constitution or one that is bound by some looser set of laws that for some reason, the institutional forces on the Hill continue to protect. And I think right now, regardless of your party, you should be deeply concerned and you should care deeply what this is all uncovering, because one day, it might not be a three-star general, it might be you.  PERINO: Right.  WILLIAMS: Good point. We're awaiting more reaction from President Trump on Flynn's unmasking. We're going to bring you that. Plus, the debate over reopening America with this pandemic going on, that's next for you on THE FIVE.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PERINO: All right. We are waiting brand-new reaction from President Trump on the release of new Michael Flynn unmasking documents. We'll have that video for you very soon. The president is meeting with governors at the White House right now about reopening the economy. The president also sitting down with Maria Bartiromo for an interview where President Trump says he disagrees with Dr. Anthony Fauci on when schools should reopen. Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: Anthony is a good person, very good person. I've disagreed with him. When I closed the border to China, he disagreed with that and then ultimately he agreed. And he said I saved hundreds of thousands of lives, in which is what happened. Everybody disagreed when I did that. I think that we have to open our schools.  Young people are very little affected by this. We have to get the schools open. We have to get our country open. We have to open our country. Now, we want to do it safely, but we also want to do it as quickly as possible. We can't keep going on like this. I mean, you got to have -- you are having bedlam already in the streets. You can't do this. We have to get it open. I totally disagree with him on schools.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: Greg, I know you and Emily from California -- want to try to get you in here before we hear from the president soon. California State university system has already decided it is going to shut all state universities for the fall's semester. How can they make that decision so soon, or is it just because they have to plan ahead?  GUTFELD: I guess so. I just -- quickly, comment on the tape we just saw. Something that the press should value about Trump is that he talks about these disagreements, right? These things we actually see. I think it was like a month ago, I said that the solution to the -- the solution to find the right answer when you don't have an answer is to let 50 experiments unfold.  For example, like California. If you don't know what's too soon or what's too late, the 50 experiments are going to tell you. So when people say, oh, screaming, oh, people will die. We know that that is a possibility. The 50 experiments will show you the best path forward. It is like your 401K portfolio, an assessment of different performances that help you evaluate the winning path.  So when you hear, like, other people in the media, I don't know what they are thinking. They prefer to pick one date for everyone, which is like putting all your chips on one number at roulette? No, no, roulette doesn't have chips. Here we go.  PERINO: Greg, we're going to have to go to the president now. Here is the president.  TRUMP: Thank you very much. It's great to be with the governor of Colorado and the governor of North Dakota, two governors that are working very hard, harder than they thought they would have to work. We also have two very distinguished senators that you know very much, Senator Gardner, who you know, and just say hello, say hello.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you. We appreciate the invitation. And, of course, appreciate all the support you are giving us and the leadership of our governors.  TRUMP: Thank you. And that is what we're here for, to do that and to talk about -- we just came out with a new list on testing. We just cracked 10 million tests, which is here. I'd like to show that to everybody, 10 million. We set an all-time record by far. If you look down here, these are other countries that have not done anywhere near what we're doing.  And we're double. If you add them up and double them, weave done more tests. But I can't get the press to print that, unfortunately. They just don't want to print it. But I want to thank the governors. Thank you very much. We appreciate it. We're going to have some good, fruitful talks about going even to the next step. And I know you are trying to open up.  And I know you are opening up, more than trying. You are opening up. And you're both doing an excellent job. And it is an honor to have you at the White House very much. And these two gentlemen have done a fantastic job. And David, you know, from Interior. And David's very much involved with your states. And how are they doing, David, what do you think?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Fantastic.  TRUMP: I think so. They are doing a good job. They really are. They're doing a good job. We are talking about, as you know, Space Force, and a lot of states are interested in Space Force. And we're talking to some of them. And I know that Colorado is very interested in it. And so we'll be talking to you about that, too, OK, we might mention that today a little bit during our meeting. So thank you all very much. Thank you.  (CROSSTALK)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Administrators and school principals around the country, in terms of their plans to reopen school and colleges in the fall?  TRUMP: Oh, I think they should open the schools, absolutely. I think they should. And it's had very little impact on young people. And I think that if you are an instructor, if you're a teacher, a professor, and you're over a certain age like, let's say 65 or maybe even if you want to be considered at 60, perhaps you want to stay out for a little while longer.  But I think you should absolutely open the schools. Our country has to get back and it's get to get back as soon as possible. And I don't consider our country coming back if the schools are closed. And it's a very unusual situation. It's had very little impact on young people. And I would strongly say they should open. It is up to the governors. It's the governors' choice.  But the state is not open if the schools are not open. So again, it's had very little impact on young people, and I think they should open their schools.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. President, (Inaudible) sanction China, would you support it if it goes to the House and it comes to your desk, would you support that bill?  TRUMP: Well, I respect -- I will certainly look at it, the bill to sanction China. So I will certainly take a look at it. I have not seen it yet.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Inaudible)  TRUMP: Well, the unmasking is a massive thing. I just got a list. It's -- who can believe a thing like this? And I watched Biden yesterday on Good Morning America being interviewed by one of your colleagues, George Stephanopoulos. And he said he knew nothing about anything. He knows nothing about anything, nothing at all. And then it gets released today that he was a big un-masker.  So how do you know nothing if you weren't the un-maskers? It is one of the very big stories. And I suspect you'll have a responsible -- even bigger stories coming out.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Follow-up on a separate -- the number of explosions in Afghanistan. But are you concerned that the peace deal may be falling apart?  TRUMP: Look, Afghanistan, we have been there for many years. We're like a police force. We are not fighting in Afghanistan. We are a police force in Afghanistan. And at some point, they're going to have to be able to take care of their country. They're going to have to be able to police their country. But we're not meant to be a police force, we are meant to be fighters.  And we've been there a long time. So I don't know. We will have to see. I have not heard that. See if we have in Kabul, we've had some pretty big blowups. But again, you count on a government to be able to police themselves, and they are having a hard time, I suspect. But again, we are the greatest fighting force in the world.  We are not a police force that's going to stay around and police the streets and check out the red lights and traffic. It is not what we're supposed to be doing. We've been there a long time. You know, our force has done quite a bit, as you know. We are way down. And a lot of people have come back, brought them back. But the government has to be able at some point to do something for themselves, right?  (CROSSTALK)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- said both that he wasn't interested in bringing interest rates negative, and that he felt a need for additional stimulus from Congress. I know that you said that we have been waiting to see stimulus and that you want negative rates, your reaction?  TRUMP: Well, I'm a believer in negative rates only if other countries that are competitors. Look, Germany, they are now friends of ours, but they're still competitors on trade and other things. So Germany, Japan, others have negative rates. And I think if they do, we are the most prime of the world. You know, we're -- it's based -- many countries, based on the dollar, the dollar is by far the strongest, most powerful currency in the world.  We've made it more powerful. We've made it stronger. And certainly, they're going to have the advantage of negative rates. We should, too. I feel strongly we should have negative rates. Negative rates is basically where they pay you interest if you borrow money. This is a new one. I've been looking for something like that all my life. That's a pretty good one.  But certainly, if other countries are going to be paid for putting up money, I mean, think of it. They are borrowing money. And instead of paying interest, they are getting paid. It's the craziest thing. But you know what, other countries are doing it. Look at Germany. Look at Japan. Look at others. And we are the most prime in the world right now.  And we have the currency and we have the power of the dollar. So I know that the chairman has done a very good job over the last couple of months. I have to tell you that because I've been critical. But in many ways, I call him my MIP. You know what MIP is, most improved player. It is called the most improved player award. Did you ever get one of them when you were playing baseball, Cory? Good baseball player?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Certainly not.  TRUMP: The chairman, he's my MIP right now for the last few months. I think he's done a very good job. I disagree with one thing now, and that is on negative rates, and only because we're paying zero. Good news with this money, you're talking about in the stimulus. We're paying zero. We're down to zero interest. That is good.  But some countries and some states, rather, and some also countries you look at. But we are paying right now zero, and other countries are paying less than that, if you can believe it, if you couldn't believe it. They are receiving money. And I think we should be in the exact same situations. And by the way, states are getting tremendous deals on borrowing.  So a lot of the states that are coming to the federal government, they can go out and they can borrow and they're getting phenomenal rates. Some of our states is where I'm talking about. They are getting phenomenal borrowing rates.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you agree stimulus should move forward? There have been some Republicans who suggest that --  (CROSSTALK)  TRUMP: I don't know. It depends. It's certainly not the package that I saw today, basically. If you look at that package, what they want more than anything else, it is a voting package. They want to be able to make sure that Republicans can't win an election by putting in all sorts of mail-in ballots. Now, I don't know if you do because the press doesn't report this too much.  But we had two very big victories last night. We won very big. Tom Tiffany won very big in the great state of Wisconsin. You saw that. That was last night. It came in. That was a big one. You saw that, Doug, and won by very, very substantial margin. And in California, of all places, we had a fantastic race, and this was all mail-in ballots.  This was all mailed ballots. And when they saw, because it was the mail, they saw they were losing three days ago. And they end up putting polling booths in into basically Democrat areas. But despite that, it is looking like Mike Garcia, I don't know if they've called the race yet. But he was substantially ahead. That's the problem with mail-in ballots.  Are they going to dump a whole pile of ballots on your desk just before the election? So the problem with the mail-in ballots it is subject to tremendous corruption -- tremendous corruption, cheating, so I'm against it. And if you look at the bill that Nancy Pelosi is putting in, it has a lot to do with elections. We're not going -- we're not going to lose elections because of that.  And I do think you should mention the fact that the Republicans won two major Congressional seats last night. I think it's really worthy of mentioning.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President, do you believe that the judge presiding over the Mike Flynn case limits  (CROSSTALK)  TRUMP: Let's finish with your question.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is that bill a nonstarter? Is there anything in there you could support?  TRUMP: Well, as they say, DOA, right? DOA, dead on arrival. Of course, Nancy Pelosi knows that, you know, obviously.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you, Mr. President. Do you believe that the judge presiding over the Michael Flynn case, Emmett Sullivan ought to recuse himself or be disqualified for being biased against Mr. Flynn?  TRUMP: I was just with General Milley and some other generals, and I asked them about General Flynn. Do you know him? They said, ""Yes, sir. I've known him for 20 years."" What do you think? ""He's an incredible man, an incredible soldier. He's an incredible general."" This is General Milley, head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, four-star. He's done fantastically.  He thinks General Flynn is a great, great gentleman and a real fighter. When I see what is happening to him, it's disgraceful and it was all a ruse. By the way, the FBI said he didn't lie. The FBI said he did not lie. So with all this stuff I'm hearing about lying, the FBI said he didn't lie. But the sleazebag said, ""Well, we don't care what they say. We're saying he lied."" OK, but the FBI, you remember when they left, they said he didn't lie.  What they've done to that man and that family is a disgrace, but I just tell you that because I just left General Milley and he said, ""A great man and a great soldier.""  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Would you consider a pardon for Mr. Flynn?  TRUMP: I won't talk about that, but he's going to be OK. He's going to be just fine.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What about the --  TRUMP: I'm very, very saddened by what's happening to General Flynn and others. I want to tell you right now, and others. Please.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Dr. Fauci yesterday was a little cautious on reopening the economy too soon. Do you share his concerns?  TRUMP: About reopening what?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Reopening the economy to soon in some states.  TRUMP: Look, he wants to play all sides of the equation. I think we're going to have a tremendous fourth quarter. I think we're going to have a transitional third quarter. I think we're going to have a phenomenal next year. I feel that we are going to have a country that's ready to absolutely have one of its best years.  Next year, with all of the stimulus and all of the fact that it's a pent-up demand like I haven't seen. And you see it right now. These two really professional, good governors that work so hard. I know both of them very well. One happens to be a Democrat, OK, but we've worked together and I think we've worked together very well. And one, you would expect me to say that, but it happens to be true, OK. Really good job too.  But we've worked very, very well together. They want to get their states open. Some governors and some perhaps partisans, maybe for election reasons, don't want to have their states open. Then some shouldn't open them quite yet. They're not ready. They went through a lot and they're not quite ready. But no we're opening our country. People want it open. The schools are going to be open.  I was seeing the other day, Purdue is a great school, great college, university. Purdue is opening and others are opening, and they're all announcing it. These are young people. These are students, young students. They're in great shape. They're in great shape.  Now when you have an incident, one out of a million, one out of 500, that well something happen perhaps. But you know, you can be driving to school and some bad things can happen too. So no, we're going to open our country. We want it open.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When you say Dr. Fauci is playing both sides, are you suggesting that the advice he's giving to you is different?  TRUMP: Well, I was surprised -- I was surprised by his answer actually, because you know, it's just -- to me, it's not an acceptable answer especially when it comes to schools. The only thing that would be acceptable as I said, is professors, teachers, etcetera, over a certain age. I think they ought to take it easy for another few weeks, five weeks, four weeks. Who knows, whatever it may be.  But I think they have to be careful. Because this is a disease that attacks age. It attacks health. And if you have a heart problem, if you have diabetes, if you're a certain age, it's certainly much more dangerous. But with the young children and students, it's really -- it's just take a look at the statistics. It's pretty amazing.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President, businesses are concerned about getting sued once they reopen. Will you be insistent on some sort of shield from liability being in a phase four bill?  TRUMP: If anything is done, I will do that. These are the new testing numbers and you saw that, but I was just showing this to a group of people. I said, we're now over 10 million tests or we will be very shortly, like within a couple of days. Look at that test. This is us. This is the rest of the world, OK. We have more tests and we have better tests. We have more tests and we have better tests.  And we're going to have your football team in, your championship football team, right? And we were -- tell us a little bit about the team. First of all, you know, they won the championship and we're all set to have them. And what happened is the plague came in. Because of the plague, came in from China. And because of the plague, we didn't have those great people, but we'll do a rain check, OK. But seriously, even if it's in a few months, we'll do a rain check. Tell them about the team because it was a tremendous season.  GOV. DOUG BURGUM (R-ND): Well, I'll just say that the team and Senator Hoeven was here, Senator Kramer was here, the whole codel, the first lady was here. She says, hi. But you hosted them last year because they again, won the national championship this year in January. This is the eighth out of ninth year in a row they've done that. They would love to get back here with the rain check.  TRUMP: So I watched the game on television, the championship game. I didn't know too much about it. I don't get to watch too much of the television, football games, right. And I'm saying, man, that team is really good. They were really good. Then I got a call from Doug and I get a call from John. I get a call from our other very friendly Senator, right, the three of them.  They said, ""Do you think we could possibly honor the team?"" Because we honor the national champion. And my question was, ""How would your team do against the national champions?"" They were pretty good, LSU this year, right? Not a bad quarterback. How do you think? I don't know. You think, OK, right?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You open up against Oregon. Next year at Oregon. So then we'll be able to answer your question.  TRUMP: That's pretty good.  BURGUM: That great LSU quarterback started his career playing flag football in elementary school in Fargo, North Dakota. So that's where  (CROSSTALK)  TRUMP: Had a good start. Well, let the team know we're going to do a rain check, OK.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. President, what will happen to the public companies that don't return their PPP loans to the SBA by tomorrow's deadline?  TRUMP: Well, we'll go after them very seriously. If there's any companies that got loans that they weren't entitled to, we'll go after them very soon. They'll have big problems.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President, what's your level of confidence that the Supreme Court will ultimately rule in your favor in the case involving your tax returns?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I hope they will. You have a situation where a president has to be able to focus on this. And you know, when you're doing an audit, you know, in the old days, no president gave tax returns. A while ago, I mean, no president gave tax returns.  But when you're under audit, who would -- who would want to give them? It's a very big thing. But it would also take time. It would take -- and this -- people are going to get -- ultimately, people are going to be getting returns. They're going to see that. But I think you know, I think it went very well yesterday. I thought I was -- I have great respect for the Supreme Court. And I think the lawyers put out a very strong case. And from what I've read, it was a very strong case. Yes, please.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: How long do you and the vice president plan to stay apart distance wise?  TRUMP: Well, it's an interesting question. I haven't seen Mike Pence and I miss him. But he was in the room with somebody that tested positive, and he did not test positive. He tested the opposite. He's in good shape. But I guess we said for a little while, we'll stay apart because you don't know what happens with this very crazy and horrible disease.  But we speak a lot on the phone, but I'm in the White House. Mike is at his office, but he's pretty much away from people. He's doing a great job. He's done a great job I think you'd say on the task force, he really has. I think you've pretty much gotten everything you wanted and we try and get it to you quickly.  GOV. JARED POLIS (D-CO): We talk to the vice president regularly.  TRUMP: We work very well together with Republican governors and with Democrat governors. When are you thinking of opening and explain what you're going to do (INAUDIBLE)  POLIS: Most businesses are open in Colorado, pretty much everything except for those social businesses like bars and nightclubs. A few places have restaurants open. We're working on the rest soon, but offices, manufacturing, salons, pretty much all people are back in a safer way, right. It's not the same way it was. I got my hair cut the other day.  TRUMP: It looks good.  POLIS: Thank you. You should have seen it before. It was crazy, what little is left of it.  TRUMP: Not bad. Not bad.  POLIS: They wore a mask. I wore a mask. So we're doing it in a safe way. All the stores are back. In April 27th, we were one of the states where we wanted to do that in a safe way. People are being responsible. I mean, you know, it's that individual responsibility that's going to make sure that we can stay on this trajectory. And hopefully, restaurants in May, by the end of May. They're already opening a few places in our state.  TRUMP: How about because I go there, as you know, and the ski slopes are fantastic. There are those that say the greatest anywhere. How are you doing with the skiing? And you know, It's a big business for you.  POLIS: It's a big business. It's also one of the reasons that we got a lot of the virus in our state because people come from all over the world. All over the world.  TRUMP: That's very true. I've heard that.  POLIS: So that's what led to the spread. And so most of the ski season is ending, but we're actually hopeful. We have -- a lot of people don't know this, but in Colorado we have a few areas that they're skiing through July 4th. And we're hoping that people will be able to ski again. David knows, the Secretary Bernard knows this. In Arapahoe Basin, and in Wolf Creek, maybe Breckenridge, Loveland in June. We're hoping that people can actually ski again.  TRUMP: You also did a lot of a summer business and springtime business. What are you doing with that?  POLIS: It's we really respecting the communities in our state because they have a lot at stake. Nobody is more at stake than -- in fact, Jill Ryan who's with us from Eagle. She's our secretary of health in Colorado. She was a commissioner in Eagle County, which is where bail is. So they have the most at stake economically and from a health perspective.  So you know, we're really respecting what the different communities decide. I think there'll be some folks that are coming back, spending money in stores. There'll be other communities that say, ""You know what? We have to wait a little bit longer."" It's been very traumatic for many of those communities because Eagle County for awhile, had the highest infection rate in the country early on.  TRUMP: I heard that.  POLIS: Yes, early on.  (CROSSTALK)  TRUMP: Now, there's people coming because everyone goes, everyone coming in. How has that been? How is the level of infection right now?  POLIS: Eagle County has done an amazing job, as has Summit County, Picking County, Aspen, all those areas, they've gotten it under control because they acted early. They have great county health departments. They look at the science, they look at the data. Their residents stayed home.  And in fact, Eagle County was one of the first in our state, along with Mesa County, which Secretary Bernard knows well in Grand Junction area, to be able to open up a little bit ahead of some of the other areas in a safer way, right, in a safer way. So like in Grand Junction, the restaurants are at 25 percent capacity, so there's space.  We're looking at ways that people can dine outdoors, sidewalks, and even on a lane of the road because it's safer to be in that environment. So those are the kinds of things that we think about as we're just trying to get back to as much normalcy as we can.  TRUMP: Corey, you're working together very much I know with the governor and everybody else.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We do. We speak regularly. The government's done a good job and I appreciate that. Here to help as much as we can.  POLIS: One of the things we did that Corey introduced us to and worked on, was importing some tests from South Korea. So they're already being used in our state. We're also partnering with the vice president and you on some Thermo Fisher tests that we think are coming very soon. We're getting, I think, 95,000 --  TRUMP: We're still over here.  POLIS: Good. We're excited because we're running through those tests from South Korea. That's what's so important is the supplies. We have the ability to do it, the labs to do it. You guys sent around the labs. We have the capacity, but it's getting the tests in. And so you know, both with the Thermo Fisher test, the Abbott test, the SolGen test, we're mixing and matching across.  We have 32 free community testing sites across our state. Some of them you drive in, some of them you walk in, but those are free. That's in addition to the hospitals and doctor's offices. Of course, you get tested there. But we have 32 free community testing sites --  TRUMP: And you have good healthcare in that state.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President, so I think the key that Jared is talking about, the governor talks about is you have counties that have a plan they're able to open up earlier than others because of the work that they're doing. So when the governor is talking about Grand Junction, you have restaurants that aren't just open, but you have dine in. In some of these restaurants, which I think is maybe some of the first around the country to actually reopen to dine in because of the good work that they have done together.  POLIS: Then we wanted to, for our restaurants who were open throughout this whole period in our state. They just did delivery. They did take out, they did curbside. We even waived some of the laws so they could sell alcohol curbside and sell alcohol delivery, because that extra piece can make the difference between them staying in business or not.  TRUMP: How did they do? How did those restaurants do with the take out?  POLIS: You'll hear from some that are doing okay with it. It doesn't work for every restaurant and that's why they need to be open for the restaurant dining. But for many of them, it's paid their bills and they've gotten through it, and it's helped them.  TRUMP: That's good. That's good.  POLIS: Not every restaurant, but I hear those stories that it's helped them get through it. That we've been able to make sure they've been able to stay in business the whole time.  TRUMP: Good job.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yesterday we talked as well about Colorado's additional Thermal Fisher tests, and that'll be a very big help to get those.  TRUMP: That's a great test. That's a new and a great test. So Doug, how about North Dakota? How you doing?  BURGUM: Well, first I want to just lead with gratitude and say thank you to you for your leadership, and the vice president, and Dr. Birx and the whole team has been a great partnership federal to state, to local and North Dakota. Secondly, wanted to say thanks to all the great people in North Dakota, because like Jared in Colorado, we relied a lot on individual responsibility, light touch from government and had great results. Here we sit today, we're number two in the nation. We passed New York this week in terms of testing per capita. So we've really driven in. We've tested over six percent of the population.  TRUMP: Great. And you're using different tests, all different and you're in good shape with the testing. What test are you using?  BURGUM: Well, this has all been the PCR, the nucleic acid testing. It's been across a number of different platforms, Thermal Fisher, Avid, Panther. And so we've got a variety of different platforms, but most of it driven through our state lab, which has had an order of magnitude increase. So we've gone to three shifts a day and each shift is doing more than three times they did before. So 10X increase going on there on the testing site.  TRUMP: That's fantastic.  BURGUM: Then we're the fifth lowest positivity rate in the country. Alaska and Hawaii are ahead of us, but we've been right at the bottom in terms of that. You take those two things together-  TRUMP: So what do you attribute? What do you attribute that to?  BURGUM: Well, I would say very early on-  TRUMP: Being a good governor.  BURGUM: Well, geography helps and the people of the state helped. Those two things, but I'd say we took early action to try to reduce transmissible moments. So we kept 93 percent of the jobs in the state open, but the seven percent we closed, bars and restaurants and personal care businesses. Everybody else kept going. All the construction, all of energy, all of Ag, including all of elective surgery at hospitals kept that going.  TRUMP: Oh wow. That's fantastic.  BURGUM: We were well-stocked. We had a great medical cash and --  TRUMP: That's great.  BURGUM: We never took more than two percent of our capacity in healthcare. We have a lot of great healthcare providers in North Dakota. Only two percent we're going to COVID.  TRUMP: That's fantastic.  BURGUM: So we were able to then drive through that. We handled the virus and really focused and we got Michelle Comber here who leads our commerce department. We have less to worry about opening up because we never really closed down. But on that other seven percent, we got bars, restaurants, personal care businesses open on May 1st. And all that's going very well under new operating procedures that everybody's using to stay safe.  TRUMP: And your oil prices are going up a little bit now. So that you're $26.00, $27.00 a barrel. And pretty soon you'll up to the number that you have to be up to. That's the big difference.  BURGUM: Well, absolutely because what we do in North Dakota is we power the world and we feed the world. Number two oil producer, producing state in the nation. A lot of the unemployment that we saw early on wasn't related to the virus. It was related to the demand destruction associated with the oil price drive.  TRUMP: Great job. John, what do you have to say about the state and the job the governor and everybody else has done? I know it well.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Listening to these two governors, I was governor for a long time. It tells me your approach is the right approach. You're working with the governors across this country and empowering them to open up as soon as they can safely, based on the conditions in their state and every state's different. And that's why that approach is so important.  Then you providing all that support, along with us in Congress with the CARES Act as well. But you see that now with North Dakota, with Colorado, and across the country. So that's why it's so important that you're doing it the way that you're doing it with these great governors that we have across the state. So thank you for that. The other thing I want to mention is for our farmers. You know I work a lot on Ag.  TRUMP: Yes.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But for our farmers and ranchers, you've been there for them and hang in there with them. They're doing a whale of a job and they're so important, and our energy industry too.  TRUMP: And we're sending them billions of dollars of money that we took in from a country that targeted them. Last year, we gave them $16 billion. The year before, we gave them $12 billion. And no other president would have done that, I can tell you.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's really important and appreciated. We need to hang in there with them. The only other thing I got to tell you is we have a great governor as you know, but he is so data-driven that I was teasing Dr. Birx, who's more data-driven? These two are amazing.  TRUMP: She is.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They're amazing together. They're just amazing.  TRUMP: That's great. Michelle, do you have anything to say?  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, it's been a privilege to work for governor of Oregon. I think it's through his wisdom that we've talked a lot about lowering the curve. But as governor pointed out, we didn't close the state. So I feel like-  TRUMP: That's so good.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We raised the bottom and we've had the good fortune to work very, very closely with our business community. And it's through that process and the open dialogue, and the collaboration, and the hyper connectedness in our state, that we were able to build what we call North Dakota smart, restart protocols with our business community over the span of about eight days. So we were closed for 40 days and 40 nights and we are opening in a safe way.  TRUMP: That's fantastic.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We're really proud of the work that's happening.  TRUMP: You've done a great job. Thank you very much. Just to finish off, go ahead.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, hi. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to thank the federal government for its partnership on our COVID-19 response. Particularly, the supplies you've given us, the tests. And I look forward to that continuing. And you know, the more people we can test, and then we can force multiply that with contact tracing. So we can quarantine people that haven't even had a test yet.  That's really you know, the way that we're going to contain the virus in Colorado. We've got a local public health department that covers every county. They are ready to do testing and contact tracing. So that's our plan. It's going to be a statewide effort.  TRUMP: Well, thank you very much. Terrific job too.  BURGUM: While we're here I want to also say, Secretary Bernhardt, doing a fantastic job because we had a chance to interact with him on national parks. We had great things going on in the Theodore Roosevelt National Park. As we move ahead with the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library, we've got the U.S. Fish and Wildlife BLM. We've been great partners working with the five tribal nations that are headquartered in North Dakota, with whom we share geography. We've done great collaboration with those tribal leaders on testing through COVID. But I just want to thank the secretary.  TRUMP: They've had a lot of difficulty in the different tribes, haven't they? A lot of difficulty. Tremendous difficulty.  BURGUM: Thank you secretary (INAUDIBLE) and for all their support as well through all this.  TRUMP: David, you've done a great job. Do you feel comfortable with all those cameras right behind your head?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You gave me clear direction to work with governors to open things up. We worked with local communities. Our parks, my goal is that we're right on the shoulder of the governor. We've worked with Larimer County Health Department and (INAUDIBLE) park to bring that online. We've opened up Theodore Roosevelt and we're -- we just announced today, the timing of the opening for Yellowstone. So we're moving forward.  TRUMP: So you getting those parks open, right?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Absolutely.  TRUMP: I hope everybody's listening. The parks are opening and rapidly actually.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: With those governors.  TRUMP: And with those governors. You want the help for the governors.  POLIS: Even with the counties.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Absolutely.  POLIS: Even within the state. And you know, we're all excited because recreating outdoors is safe and healthy. The flip side is, we're not yet ready to have all the people from other states and other countries coming in. So that's the battle.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's why we're collaborating with those local communities to ramp up --  TRUMP: So in all cases, you're working with governors in opening up --  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And local towns.  TRUMP: That's good.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Absolutely.  TRUMP: That's great. Great job. Thank you.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Good neighbor.  TRUMP: Thank you very much, everybody.  (CROSSTALK)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- confidence in American public go travel on America's airlines right now.  TRUMP: They have great confidence and they have great confidence in us, and they have great confidence in the airlines. We've saved the airlines with $25 billion and another $25 billion. And we have airlines that are now in good shape. I mean, obviously, they're going to pick up with the fares and with the seats, but the airline industry is in good shape. We've been able to save the airline industry, which would have been devastating if that happened. So they're in good shape. Thank you very much. Thank you.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you, Press. Thank you.  TRUMP: Thank you.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: All right, if you ever wanted to be a fly on the wall in the cabinet room of the White House, you just got an opportunity to listen in on the conversation the president was having with a couple of governors and of course the Secretary of Interior Dave Bernhardt, taking questions from the press as well.  So we still have THE FIVE together, so we'll take it around the table, so to speak. Jesse, maybe let's just start on bigger news of today on the Flynn unmasking, list that has come out. The president is talking about that. He has an interview with Maria Bartiromo, which will air tomorrow morning. He says there is more to come.  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Well, there keeps being more to come. And he's been right, and Fox has been right. All of our reporting on this entire thing has proven to be accurate. And all reporting from the other side in the mainstream media has proven false, which makes me wonder, why aren't the mainstream media reporters angry?  They were fed lies by their sources for three years and they printed fake news. Now, if I printed fake news for three years and then I found out through the transcripts my sources knew they were telling me lies and knew they were having me push a fake story, I'd be angry at my sources.  But they're not angry at their sources. They are angry at the people that have pointed out that their sources lied. Think about how ridiculous that is. Now they're saying the president is politicizing the intelligence. That is pretty funny coming from them because it wasn't Donald Trump that set people up with stings, that used spies, that cooked up crooked dossiers and colluded with the Russians and entrapped people and threw political opponents in jail. No, that was Democrats that did that.  All the president is doing now, like this unmasking list, is shining a light. All he's doing is disinfecting the last administration. He's exposing it. He's correcting an injustice. That's what's going on here. And the timing is not being used to distract from the pandemic.  It was Adam Schiff that released all of those transcripts under oath. Remember that. And it was the Justice Department that withheld the exculpatory evidence from General Flynn for two years. So the timing of all of this, it's on the Democrats. It's not on the Republicans.  PERINO: Greg, Jesse brings up something that reminds me of -- do you remember during the Obama administration when Ben Rhodes, the national security communications guy said, did that whole interview basically saying that he had played the media on Iran and how they had just fell for everything that he said.  I mean, one of the -- when Jesse just said that it made me think about how reporters -- I mean you would have think they would have been mad then.  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Yes. I feel like a broken record but the fact is look, I just -- I just saw -- I think it was one of Biden's spokesperson meltdown on Twitter over this basically attacked Catherine Herridge. It's pretty brutal attack on her. And I believe they might have removed the tweet.  I'm just interested how the media is going to approach that. Will that be considered a sexist attack because she's a woman or is it different because it was a Democrat doing the attacking. But it's clear that Joe's campaign is worried.  And I hate -- I hate to pretend -- I hate to act like the worst, the very worst of the media and the very worst of the Democrats about demanding this person get locked up and this person be tried and this person go away. But something's got to be done for Adam Schiff because he created three years of a massive fallacy that did so much damage to this country and made us miss probably one of the most important stories of our lifetime.  We were having hearings on impeachment while the corona virus was exploding. We talked about that virus in green rooms, but we were -- we to do this impeachment story. We had to show these hearings. It's all on him, man. He's got to go. They got to investigate him. They got to hold him accountable.  I'm not going to say he should go to prison, but my evil twin will say he should go away to prison for a very long time.  PERINO: Juan, I think that the next few days are going to be very interesting to see how many Democrats are going to be willing to talk on the record about what's been going on and what's been revealed.  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Well, I think people are glad to talk. I think the question is are you playing into a political action. You know, regardless of how you view it, I think lots of people do worry that it is diversionary. Certainly, Vice President Biden has said that.  The other thing that I wanted to mention to you, Dana, was I think the president was pretty clear. He said that the Democrats bill that Nancy Pelosi put out today is DOA, dead on arrival. And then he said that Jay Powell, the Federal Reserve chair is his most improved player over the last few months for reducing interest rates and the like.  But today Jay Powell came out and said you know, the economy is in big trouble and needs additional help and support from the government. So the question now becomes what will the president and the Treasury Secretary Mr. Mnuchin put forward. Are they going to negotiate?  Because their own Federal Reserve chair, the most improved player for the president is saying the economy, the workers need help and Nancy Pelosi is talking about getting more money to workers, more money for kids who are hungry through food stamps, more money for small business.  PERINO: Well, and also having the government play God on a lot of things which perhaps is not the best way to get money in the hands of people to do stuff. But well, hopefully we're going to talk about that today. Hopefully, we'll get a chance tomorrow.  Emily, can I talk to you a little bit about this reopening. He's talking to the governors. Are you seeing that out in where you are that the parks are reopening, that people are figuring out a way to get back to business? You mentioned that there's a possible registry at restaurants in Seattle.  EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Exactly. That the governor has outlined a plan for a restaurant to be able to have dine in people. So for people to be able to go and sit indoor, they have to provide -- the restaurants have to stipulate, agree to its stipulation. They'll provide the names, e-mail addresses, and telephone numbers of those diners.  So of course, people are sort of revolting. It remains to be seen obviously whether that's going to be implemented. But as of now, the governor has articulated that. If I may, Dana, you asked before we cut to the president about California which is where I'm from, and we saw the difference of the governor's treatment in California of all of those other governor's that were in the Cabinet Room with the president.  Governor Newsom is operating under a short-term crisis psychology and it's in stark contrast to that long-term fundamental unraveling that we are watching there --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: Yes. All right, Emily.  COMPAGNO: We'll pick at back up tomorrow.  PERINO: Sorry, we got to kick it over to Bret Baier. We'll have more of THE FIVE tomorrow, of course. Don't miss an episode of THE FIVE.

3,FOX,"Media accuses President Trump of racism after fiery exchange with White House reporter at Rose Garden news conference. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.  Sign up here.  At the end of President Trump’s press conference Monday, a reporter offered a churlish opinion disguised as a question. Trump responded in his usual way. CBS News White House Correspondent Weijia Jiang asked: “Why is this a global competition to you if every day Americans are still losing their lives and we’re still seeing more cases every day?” JOY BEHAR: TRUMP SUPPORTERS SHOULD ASK THEMSELVES 'IF THEY'RE RACIST' AFTER PRESIDENT'S EXCHANGE WITH ASIAN REPORTER The president replied: “Well, they’re losing their lives everywhere in the world. And maybe that’s a question you should ask China. Don’t ask me. Ask China that question, OK? When you ask them that question, you may get a very unusual answer.” Jiang responded: “Sir, why are you saying that to me, specifically, that I should ask China?” Trump said: “I’m not saying it specifically to anybody. I’m saying it to anybody that would ask a nasty question like that.” Jiang responded: “That’s not a nasty question.” Of course, how did the media see it? Brian Stelter of CNN said: “It is racist to look at an Asian-American White House correspondent and say ‘ask China.’ This isn’t happening in a vacuum. This is part of a pattern of behavior from the president that goes back many years. He doesn’t have the benefit of the doubt that someone might have if for the first time ever in their life, they made a comment like that to a reporter…  He’s also had this pattern of reacting to minority journalists in a very specific and different way.” Oddly, Stelter's right – there is a pattern of behavior. But it makes his argument hideously laughable. Here's the pattern of behavior, you sputtering chucklehead. President Trump has made the following comments about China to reporters of multiple racial and ethnic backgrounds – not just Asian-Americans – in discussing the coronavirus that originated in China: “There’s nobody ever been tougher on China than me.” “Our relationship with China was good until they did this.” “All I can say is, wherever it came from – it came from China.” “They didn't report what was happening inside of China. No, I'm not happy with China.” “They didn't want us to close our borders to China.” “The only leader of a country that closed our borders tightly against China.” “We're talking to China and we've expressed how we felt. We're not happy about it.” It's amazing we'd have to do a montage of Trump mentioning China, over and over. To anyone. But the media are like a stupid child. You’ve got to walk them through stuff they try to forget, every single day. The fact is, Trump’s been calling out China more often than Brian calls out for Chinese. And Trump was doing it when every moron with a microphone was obsessed with Russia – especially Brian Stelter’s own network. It’s an outfit that watches and waits for its biases to be confirmed. You want to know how it works? Here's an analogy: Bob swears at everyone. Then he swears at someone who's not white. CNN says “see, Bob's racist.” Their grift: ignore the color-blind behavior and selectively pick an instance that builds a smear. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER It’s what a broken media does. Their crumbling psyche prompts them to see things they wish were there. This is called fiction. A never-ending profit model of conflict and bitterness that requires smearing people. This relies solely on mindreading: that when Trump says “China,” they can tell its racist. Yet, there's no evidence.  They just know. Because they hope it is. But this isn't just about Trump. Calling him racist is the media's gateway drug to calling you the same thing. Right Joy?

4,FOX," This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" May 12, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everybody. I am Jesse Watters, along with Dana Perino, Greg Gutfeld, Juan Williams, and Katie Pavlich. It is 5:00 in New York City, and this is THE FIVE. It looks like the Obamagate scandal is about to get a lot bigger. Acting National Intelligence Director, Ric Grenell, has declassified information about the Obama administration officials responsible for unmasking Michael Flynn.  A source familiar with the intel saying those yet to be released names on the list will make waves. The DOJ is reviewing the documents ahead of a possible release. Remember, leaking unmasked information or using it for political gain is illegal. Barack Obama and Joe Biden facing renewed scrutiny over a key Oval Office meeting back in January 2017, where the Flynn investigation came up. Biden flip-flopping on what he knew.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I know nothing about those moves to investigate Michael Flynn. I thought you asked me whether or not I had anything to do with him being prosecuted. I'm sorry. I was aware that there was -- that they had asked for investigation, but that's all I know about it. And I don't think anything else.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: Biden also claiming that the DOJ dropping the Flynn case is just all a part of a big distraction.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  BIDEN: This is all about diversion. This is a game this guy plays all the time. The country is in crisis, from an economic crisis, a health crisis. We are in real trouble. He continues to act irresponsibly. He hasn't done his job. This is all about diverting attention, diverting the attention from the horrible way in which he has acted with what -- he's not -- we don't have Coronavirus because of him, but we have the devastating impact of it because of his lack of a policy, his lack of action.  (CROSSTALK)  BIDEN: It's all about diversion.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: All right. Well, we obviously want to monitor the calls, you know, of high-ranking Russian officials. But the reason they're not identifying the American is to protect their privacy. So if someone in the Obama administration asks permission to find out the name of that American citizen, they'd better have a very good reason.  And the person that asks to be -- have Biden unmasked if they are connected to the president or vice president, Dana, that's a pretty big deal, don't you think?  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, I think this story is a big deal. I think the issue is a big deal, and we are seeing that play out. I do think a couple things so remember this -- supposedly, it was predicated on a counterintelligence investigation. And I think it would almost be worse if you had a rogue Justice Department and FBI not telling the president of the United States and the vice president, what they were up to.  That would be super bad. Like, you would see that in a movie. I don't think that it would be unusual that President Obama would be informed and briefed about a counterintelligence investigation even if it involved the incoming administration. I think it would be a huge scandal if it was not. Now that said, for the people that were asked to have Flynn's name unmasked or got the unmasking, found out Flynn's name.  He found out whoever leaked that. That is obviously a very bad thing. And all of these people that worked for President Obama in that world. I bet you're going to see a couple things, Jesse, one, if they're -- they're going to want to talk about this, right? So if the DNI is declassifying their names, is it also fair then that he should declassify the information and basically let it all out so that they can defend themselves.  Because, as I would feel about it, like, if you had a top-secret clearance and you are a part of this and then your name gets out there but you're still under the clearance rules so that you can't talk about it and defend yourself. That doesn't seem exactly right. So I don't know where that part is going. But the second thing I think will happen is you're going to see all of these people lawyer up very quickly.  And probably with pro bono lawyers, as you saw before with McCabe and Strzok, and those GoFundMe pages, if you'll remember those. But I think that will happen, so if they are not allowed to talk about it, they will lawyer up, and then it will go very quiet.  WATTERS: Yeah. I mean, maybe the unmasking is not a bad as the leaking of the classified conversation, Juan, the leaking of the classified conversation which is a crime, and then the leaking of the Flynn name is a crime. So that's probably worse than just requesting the identity.  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, you know, leaks are not good if you're trying to maintain national security, Jesse. So I don't think anyone's going to argue that. The question here is about the behavior of Michael Flynn. I mean, you can't say President Obama told him to call Kislyak, the Russian Ambassador, and discuss the sanctions regime for Russian interference.  I don't think anyone wants to make that case. So I don't think that's Obama. I don't think that's Biden. No one is saying, oh, yeah, you know, he's that one that told Flynn go ahead and act as a lobbyist for Turkey but don't register as a lobbyist. Nobody is saying all that was done by Stone, by Manafort. Oh, that was all made up by the Obama administration.  Look, I think this is all a waste of government energy, resources, and time when we should be focused on the Coronavirus and trying to get this economy back in order. I -- you know, Ric Grenell used to be -- we know him --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: So this is a waste of time, not the last three years of the witch hunt. This is?  WILLIAMS: No. I think Grenell is acting in a very political fashion, again, going after what we know --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: Grenell is political. But the Obama intelligence officials were not political, but Grenell is political? Is that what you are saying?  WILLIAMS: I am thinking that right now, we have Russia, China, and others seeking to interfere again. That's where our energies should be, not in some political diversionary tactic to benefit President Trump.  WATTERS: OK, very diversionary, just trying to correct injustice. Katie, how do you see this playing out? Biden now saying I don't know anything. That doesn't really sound like someone that was really in charge.  KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS HOST: Right. And he was in the Oval Office when President Obama informed Sally Yates that the FBI had been listening in on phone calls that Michael Flynn had made to the Russian ambassador. So for him to say he doesn't know anything doesn't really, you know, stick with the facts here on the situation.  But, you know, Dana made a good point that the president of the United States would, of course, be involved and informed of a counterintelligence investigation, especially if it was someone who was on a campaign in the political sense. But the argument up to this point has been that the president wasn't involved. He didn't know anything.  This, of course, he didn't reach the highest levels of the Obama administration. Well, now, we know at least that President Obama knew about it. And he was giving information to people at the Justice Department at the time, and details about it to them that they didn't have before. So it seems like he was pretty involved.  And then you couple that with the Obama administration's history and actions of using the power of the federal government, whether it was the IRS going after Tea Party groups for political reasons or the Department of Justice going after gun dealerships by punishing their banks, or whether it was going after reporters who were talking to sources that Obama wanted to put behind bars for talking and leaking information.  So all of that information leads to more questions, and people want accountability for this. There has been a wrong here. And they want to know which public officials that they were paying were unfairly and illegally leaking information and names to the media on a citizen who had done nothing wrong.  WATTERS: All right, Greg, last word.  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, first of all, to Biden. He is in a bind, because either he knew, which is a problem, or either he didn't, which is a problem. Because I think he didn't know, because I can't believe anybody would come to him for advice. The guy was more out of the loop than a drunken figure skater. He was just a nice guy you had in the room who shook hands and wore the aviator glasses.  As for this being a waste of government time and we should be focusing on the Wuhan virus, I said that three months ago. I said that four months ago in January when I was screaming about the Wuhan virus. And everybody was intent to watch the impeachment hearings. So nobody can lecture anybody on that. It's a load of crap.  I am curious where the hyperventilating, tick-tick-boom idiots who drooled over every Russian name in the phonebook, why isn't Rachel Maddow leading her show with the scandal behind the scandal? If this is a joke, if this is meaningless, how about your three-and-a-half your delusional fantasy that went on based solely on somebody knowing somebody?  You only had thoughts but no proof, so you inflated your thoughts into proof. And now, you find out that it's worse than you thought because it involves Trump -- Obama, your side. So now it scares you. This leads to something that I've always wanted to talk about but we could never talk about it on THE FIVE, because it was too gross, the Steele dossier, which is behind all of this, right?  We could never talk about it, because the media used it as a shield of scuz. Like, they could talk about it at late-night shows. We could never really get into it because the content of the dossier was sufficiently lurid, right? So the media could use it at will. We really couldn't touch it. But let's be clear how the Republic -- how the Russians -- getting ahead of myself -- how the Russians really praying to us, because the Steele dossier was a cartoon version of what you think would enrage Obama loyalists.  You had a Russian going what if we tell them that we have hookers defile the bed Obama has slept in front of Mr. Trump. That's what we tell them. How obviously absurd and fake is that? All that's missing is Boris Batanov (ph), Natasha, and perhaps Rasputin in the same room. Yet our media, a bunch of tools, got suckered by this garbage, as well as panoply of politicians who chased this crap down.  Steele himself was just a conduit for this nonsense. So the real hilarious punchline of the last four years is that a porno fantasy suckered all of our bright minds in the media and all our sharp dressers in D.C.  PAVLICH: There are no sharp dressers in D.C.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Good point.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: -- did the Russian accent.  GUTFELD: My wife is going to kill me.  WATTERS: Democrats looking to politicize the pandemic after top health officials testify before the Senate, and we will show you that next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PERINO: The nation's top health officials testifying remotely today before the Senate on reopening the economy. Dr. Anthony Fauci issuing a warning about states restarting their economies too soon.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH: At some areas, cities, states, or what have you, jump over those various checkpoints and prematurely open up without having the capability of being able to respond effectively and efficiently. My concern is that we will start to see little spikes that might turn into outbreaks.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: And there was this contentious moment between Senator Rand Paul and Dr. Fauci. Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think we ought to have a little bit of humility in our belief that we know what's best for the economy. And as much as I respect you, Dr. Fauci, I don't think you are the end-all. I don't think of the one person that gets to make the decision.  FAUCI: I have never made myself out to be the end-all and only voice of this. I am a scientist, a physician, and a public health official. I give advice according to the best scientific evidence. There are a number of other people who come into that and give advice that are more related to the things that you spoke about, the need to get the country back open again and economically. I don't give advice about economic things. I don't give advice about anything other than public health.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: All right. Greg, what did you take away from this hearing today?  GUTFELD: Well, I always say -- you know, I've said this before. If you are pointing fingers, there is an entrance fee, you know? You have to ask -- you have to say how would you have done this differently? But you cannot use 20/20 hindsight. We do know that Trump relied on experts, and experts were wrong on masks, tests, ventilators, and especially the experts that were informing Cuomo rest homes.  So if you believe that you would've done better, the big question -- if you knew something, why did you hold out on us? All you smarty-pants people in the media, why did you have this inside info on fighting a virus and held it back for us? And that -- it is amazingly -- it's amazing how accurate pundits and politicians are when they're looking backward, like the standard for testing, you know?  Tell us exactly what the standard for testing is, considering the experts don't even know what it is because they haven't dealt with it before. So the thing is you can't tell what a good job is when it's the first job. We know it could always be better. But you don't know how. So do not trust the media on this, but do not fault people, whether it is Fauci, whether it is Trump, even whether it is Cuomo, who give advice or take a risk and turn out to be wrong, because everybody's going to be wrong on this no matter what.  PERINO: And Jesse, one thing I did notice today in the hearing is that the Democrats were very frustrated at the government, at the Trump administration in particular. And their solutions, though, seemed to be that we need more government.  WATTERS: Yeah, because government has done so well over the last so many years. To Greg's point about the Democrats' strategy, it's a great point because we still don't know what the Democrats' strategy is, because all they say is Trump is either doing things too slowly or he's doing things too quickly. So all it is, is just a complaint. I mean, Petraeus had the surge strategy.  Though, Trump had the tariff of strategy with China. There is no Democrat strategy on this. It's whining. That's all it is. So I watched this entire hearing. And it's incredibly frustrating because they have set these traps with tests. Now, we would have gotten the tests sooner if China hadn't destroyed the virus samples in the lab, if they had just shared it with the rest of the world.  We could have gotten the tests a lot quicker. But now, here's what they are doing with testing. Now that we've tested more people than all the other countries in the world combined, they say OK, well, the testing rate isn't good enough. Permission to make a sports analogy, Dana, this is like when a quarterback goes 9 for 10 for 100 yards.  And the opposing quarterback goes 39 for 50 for 400 yards. The Democrats think the quarterback that went 9 for 10 is better because he had a better completion percentage. No, anybody with a brain will take the quarterback that had 39 completions for 400 yards. So don't fall into that trap. I do agree, though. Testing needs to get better.  And I was disappointed with the CDC director, this guy, Redfield. I don't get a good feeling about him. They had the lab contamination early. He doesn't inspire confidence. He is a poor communicator. He is not clear. He doesn't look charged up. Something about this guy I don't like. I can't put my finger on it. But the fact that he hasn't been out in front center on this whole thing from the beginning, as the CDC director, tells you a lot.  PERINO: But he has been. I mean, like, the White House has been having him do a lot of talk radio all across the nation, because they think he's been great. But I take your point. And, of course, it wasn't easy, Juan, to hear everybody during the remote. There was the dog that was barking and also Lamar Alexander's cute dog that was sitting behind him. What did you take away from the hearing?  WILLIAMS: Dogs. Well, you know, I find that entertaining because I think it's very real. And you get the sense that these are human beings. You know, we see them in the official setting of a Senate hearing. And you think it's just some guy in a suit. In response to what Jesse was saying, by the way, I was taken by the idea that you had Republicans like Lamar Alexander, Mitt Romney saying, hey, the testing has just not been sufficient and nothing to celebrate.  And especially if we are looking towards reopening schools in the fall, we don't have that in place. Fauci was very clear about that. We don't have any kind of regiment or testing or any kind of way that we can assure the chance at the University of Tennessee, for example, I think that's what they were talking about, with Senator Alexander, that you can open school in the fall.  Because right now, it just doesn't seem that that's a reasonable goal to have. The other thing I would say is in terms of what Fauci said, again, I don't think this is Republican or Democrat. I think Fauci just said with those -- with the potential for spikes out across our country, not just in the big cities. There is just too much potential for death and more suffering and more people getting sick.  And I -- it was very clear to me that he was trying to not politicize it, not to get into a back-and-forth with Rand Paul, but to say he was speaking as a scientist and that people should listen.  PERINO: Yeah. Katie, on the school thing, the chairman did go back to Fauci and say let's clarify. And Fauci said different solutions for different places. But he also said something that people might take some hope from. And that was that when pressed by Senator Romney, do you really think it's realistic to get a vaccine within a year or two? Fauci said absolutely, that is possible.  PAVLICH: Yeah. And I thought what Rand Paul said about keeping kids out of school for a year and the consequences of that, especially if they are lower income kids. There would be severe consequences for that. And also, Dr. Fauci said that the vast majority of people who get this disease recover. And I think there needs to be more focus on the recovery numbers in addition to the new cases and the continuation of the flattening of the curve.  And in the end, they're going to be consequences on both sides of this no matter what decision they make. Do you keep it locked down? There will be severe consequences in so many different sectors for that. If you open it back up, yes, there will be more cases, but the deal was never to have zero cases. The deal was to get the hospitals ready to deal with this.  PERINO: Yeah. There is no perfect decision to be made, indeed, and tough ones ahead.  PAVLICH: Yeah.  PERINO: All right. Thanks, everybody. We have a media firestorm erupting after President Trump's clash with a reporter in the Rose Garden yesterday. Greg's monologue on that is next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: All right. Yesterday, at the end of Trump's presser, a reporter offered a churlish opinion disguised as a question. And Trump responded in his usual way.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Why is this global competition to you if everyday Americans are still losing their lives and we are still seeing more cases everyday?  DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: Well, they are losing their lives everywhere the world. And maybe that's a question you should ask China. Don't ask me. Ask China that question, OK? When you ask them that question, you may get a very unusual answer. Yes, behind you, please.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Sir, why are you saying that to me specifically?  TRUMP: I'm telling you. I'm not saying it specifically to anybody. I am saying it to anybody that would ask a nasty question.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That's not a nasty question.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Of course, how did the media see it?  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It is racist to look at an Asian-American White House correspondent and say ask China. This isn't happening in a vacuum. This is part of a pattern of behavior from the president that goes back many years. So he doesn't have the benefit of the doubt that someone might have if for the first time ever in their life they made a comment like that to a reporter. He also has this pattern of reacting to minority journalists in a very specific and different way.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Oddly, Stelter is right. There is a pattern of behavior. But it makes his argument hideously laughable. Here's the pattern of behavior, you sputtering chucklehead.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: There is nobody ever been tougher on China than me. Our relationship with China was good until they did this. All I can say is wherever it came from, it came from China. They didn't report what was happening inside of China. No, I'm not happy with China.  They didn't want us to close our borders to China. The only leader of a country that closed our borders tightly against China.  We're talking to China and we've expressed how we felt. We're not happy about it.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Not happy. It's amazing we'd have to do a montage of Trump mentioning China over and over to anyone. But the media is like a stupid child. You got to walk them through stuff they try to forget every single day. The fact is Trump has been calling out China more often than Brian calls out for Chinese. And Trump was doing it when every moron with a microphone was obsessed with Russia, especially be his own network. It was an outfit that watches and waits for its biases to be confirmed.  You want to know how it works? Here's an analogy. Bob swears at everyone, then he swears at someone who's not white. CNN says see Bob is racist. They're grift ignore the colorblind behavior and selectively pick an instance that builds a smear. It's what a broken media does, their crumbling psyche, prompts it to see things they wish were there.  This is called fiction, a never-ending profit model of conflict and bitterness that requires smearing people. Rich relies solely on mind- reading, that when Trump says China, they can tell it's racist, yet there's no evidence they just know because they hope it is. But this isn't just about Trump calling him racist, it's the media's gateway drug to calling you the same thing. Right, Joy?  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JOY BEHAR, HOST OF THE VIEW, ABC NEWS: He is a racist. He throws red meat to his base on a regular basis. And anybody who still supports this guy needs to look in the mirror and ask themselves if they are racist also. That's all I have to say about him. I've had enough of him.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: The feeling's mutual, you bag lawn clippings. So, Jesse, I believe Trump says China more than he says wall, and he says, anybody. You'll be walking down the street, and if you trip, he'll go, that's China. It doesn't matter what nationality.  WATTERS: It's close. Listen, this morning, the President accused an anchor on television of murdering an intern, OK. That was pretty bad. And this is a white male anchor that he accused of murdering an intern. I mean, come on, man. Like we do this all the time.  Last month, that President said, oh, you're talking to a black reporter. You people, you people, and they said that was racist. And then we ran clips of him saying you people to reporters every day of the week for the last three years.  So this is what they do. If they find a way to play the race card and make the story about themselves, I mean, this is a twofer and they love it. And no one even thought it was racist until this woman that said that. Yes, you know, Katie, Trump never mentioned her race, but Brian Stelter immediately noticed it. Isn't he the racist here?  PAVLICH: Yes. He's the one who seems to be hyper-focused on who that woman was, and maybe what nationality she is, which is American, by the way. Reporter 101 is not to make yourself the story. This woman continues to make herself in the story during these white house briefings.  And it's really amazing to me to continue to watch the so-called most prestigious press corps in the world act this way when there are journalists in places like China, where the Communist Party exists, who get disappeared when they dare to tell the truth about where this virus came from, the fact that China lied about it and cover it up.  And yet you have journalists in America continuing to ignore the basic fact that this is something that China did to the rest of the world, when they are supposed to be focused on facts, and apples and oranges and apples and bananas, and all the things that they like to say while continuing to cover for the fact that China did this. It's a basic fact. They should be focused on it.  GUTFELD: That's a good point, Juan. Could this little outrage that Brian is pushing just be immediate distraction to take away from the bumbling of their coverage of the Wuhan virus?  WILLIAMS: I don't know about that one. I do agree with you to this --  GUTFELD: I just used your logic from your previous. That's a distraction.  WILLIAMS: I appreciate. You know, I know -- I know you're trying to always imitate me, but you got to give it a break. I was -- I think that there's no way, to just agree with you on this initial point, to know what was in his mind if he wasn't doing that for whatever reason because she was Asian. I don't know.  What I do know and I can tell you is that there have been black reporters - - I know he's talking to April Ryan who's a black woman report the White House, and all of a sudden, he says, well, why don't you set up a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus, and she took offense at that. She's not -- she's a reporter. She's not a government official.  Or he says to black woman reporters, you're dumb or you're nasty, and these people take offense. I don't think there's any question about it, Greg. And they do feel that it's somewhat racial. So you know, it's not -- it's not playing a card. I think people are genuinely offended. I know, when he was talking about that American judge who was had a case involving him. He said, guy couldn't be fair because he had Mexican president -- appearance. I know people thought that was racist.  So there's a lot going on here. I just hope that people can just be honest and not necessarily play any card but at least have an honest discussion. Something's going on here. I guess --  GUTFELD: Yes. We are having an honest discussion. You can't sit here --  WILLIAMS: -- you know, I wouldn't walk away the way that he did.  GUTFELD: You were right. You can't read his mind. The fact that he says -- he calls everybody nasty, Dana. We know that. We know he calls everybody names.  WILLIAMS: No. You know, that's the thing about one man and --  GUTFELD: He treated Rand Paul pretty bad during the -- oh, my God. Is your amnesia that bad? Is your amnesia that bad that you forget the debates and what he did to everybody during the debates, the nicknames? He was ruthless. All right, we got to move. Dana, last word to you. Thoughts. Do you find that her question -- here's a -- I felt her question was deliberately designed to create some attention and not to gain knowledge.  PERINO: Well, welcome to the White House press briefings. I mean, that's been true for a long time. You know, the question about testing had come up over and over again. I will say that when -- as soon as I heard him say it, I was like, she might take offense at it or it might gain some steam. And even if he didn't mean it that way, it's how it comes across and perception is a lot of it.  The briefing was really good yesterday about testing. We've got a lot of information out there. And I think the White House wants more of these briefings. So if the 18th question on testing is going to push everybody over the edge may be just asked 16 questions on testing next time.  GUTFELD: Yes, there you go. All right, up next, will Joe Biden ever come out of hiding? The former V.P. explains his basement campaign next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WILLIAMS: The Coronavirus taking Joe Biden off the campaign trail, forcing him to campaign from his basement in Delaware. Now, critics claim the Democrats are hiding him. But the presumptive nominee, he's pushing back. Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm anxious to go out and campaign, George. You know, when I campaign, I'm usually the first one there and the last one to leave. I enjoy interfacing with people. I'm not trying to avoid it, but I'm trying to set an example as to how we should proceed in terms of dealing with this health and economic crisis.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ANCHOR, ABC NEWS: Finally, Mr. Vice President --  BIDEN: And no damage so far that I can see.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: So Jessie, do you think that's right? No damage so far. He's up, I think, it's plus four and the Real Clear Politics average polls and the President's approval rating not going up, but about 45 disapproval about 51, so what's the damage to the Biden?  WATTERS: Well, you're wrong because Biden's lead on Trump went from seven to four since the quarantine. And Trump is in an all-time high in Gallup 49 percent approval. So Biden has lost ground under quarantine. He doesn't want to leave his house. He's afraid to go outside. He wouldn't know what to do if he went outside and his advisors are still getting paid. So they're happy to keep Joe locked up so he doesn't make more gaffs.  I mean, it's -- Biden could go get a test. He could go tour at a mask factory. He could go look at a lab. They just opened up Amtrak. He could take a ride on Amtrak. People could see him getting out there, and it would inspire confidence. He says he's doing this because he wants to lead by example. No one looks to Joe Biden to say what to do with coronavirus. Every interview, he's coughing touching his face. Come on, the guy doesn't know what he's doing.  The other thing is to -- Juan, listen, Joe Biden is going to get rusty in the basement. He's out of shape. He's going to come in and the debates are going to go up. He's going to get his clock clean. He's not ready. And no one's ever said Joe Biden has been a strong campaigner. That's -- no one has ever said this guy is a workaholic. So stop acting like he's the first one there and the last one to leave.  WILLIAMS: So Greg, the question arises, the president says he'll get Joe Biden the test so you can get out of the basement, get on the campaign trail, but do you think that Biden is just happy to have a referendum on Trump and Trump's briefings and every mistake Trump makes?  GUTFELD: No. I mean, again, what is it -- what -- how sad is it when the best thing you can say about your candidate is that he's out of sight, right? That -- it's like -- it's such a relief that he's hidden. The pandemic gave the Democrats the perfect excuse to keep Biden under wraps. Oh, he's quarantining. He's now like a generic candidate in a survey. He's there and not there.  If the Dems have their way, no one will see Joe in the flesh until Election Day when they will come out in bubble wrap, you know, with a pre-recorded message. You know, this is not -- this is not a candidate you could support if he must be kept in secret. His best trait is his absence, which is why they're navigating to find some kind of V.P. that will add to it.  And how -- I mean -- and I believe it's probably going to be Kamala Harris, right? Because you know why?  WILLIAMS: I don't know.  GUTFELD: Oh, you don't know?  WILLIAMS: Katie, what do you think about -- I think -- I don't know, personally. I don't. But Katie, what do you think about the ads? I see that the Trump campaign is going to roll out $10 million in ads trying to tie Biden to China?  PAVLICH: Yes. You know, the digital game is one that the Trump campaign has won before. They have a lot of money to do it. And the Biden campaign is running this ad in places like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, blaming President Trump for the collapse of the economy. Well, that opens the door right up to say, do you want to Biden economy which he mimic less than two percent GDP growth as you saw, or do you want a Trump economy? So -- and the China thing, there's a lot of questions that he's going to have to answer about that.  WILLIAMS: So Dana, where would you go on that? If you're the Trump campaign, do you think it's early to be spending that much money? It seems early, but they have a lot of money to spend.  PERINO: No, I don't.  WILLIAMS: They have -- they've raised a tremendous amount of money. Yes.  PERINO: Yes, they have a lot of money. And remember that adage that presidential campaigns are won or lost in the late spring in early summer. So, I think now is absolutely the time that both campaigns should try to step on the gas. We're in a pandemic. That might look very different.  I have a feeling and got a little Spidey sense that we might not actually see Joe Biden until late summer, you know, leaving his house. I think that that is an actual possibility. However, I think the country is so polarized that up -- that you will see this race be neck and neck all the way up until the fall.  WILLIAMS: Thanks, Dana. Coming up, a dangerous situation in prisons. Inmates trying to infect themselves with the coronavirus on purpose. Wow. We're going to tell you more about that after the break on THE FIVE.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PAVLICH: Welcome back. Coronavirus chaos wrapping up in some major liberal California cities. San Francisco coming under fire after a homeless camp tripled in size during outbreak. The city being sued because the encampment grew by 300 percent creating unsanitary and unsafe conditions.  And over in Los Angeles, a sheriff saying inmates are deliberately trying to infect themselves with the coronavirus in an effort to get early release. So this is a lightning round. Dana, what are your thoughts about this?  PERINO: Sorry, did you say my name? I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you because of the timing --  PERINO: I did, yes. idea.  (CROSSTALK)  PAVLICH: Yes, Dana, lightning round, over to you.  PERINO: OK. I think one -- yes, a lot of people do recover from the virus, but a lot of people get very, very sick and many, many people have died. So trying to infect yourself is a terrible idea. California had so many problems before this pandemic that now this is all compounding.  And we just heard right before this show that the public health commissioner in Los Angeles County is basically saying they might not be able to let up on their lockdown for another three months. So their problems are just like exponentially growing.  PERINO: Greg?  GUTFELD: Yes, inmates trying to get the virus is a lesson in incentives. The government incentivize them by linking the disease to freedom. And the choice was kind of logical. Five years in a cell with somebody who hate or take a chance at two weeks to three weeks of near-death illness, I would take the risk too, and I'm kind of OK with prison. I like three meals and being alone.  As for the broken system that Dana mentioned, it's enabled by moral cowards who are fearful that any adult decision dealing with the homeless and mentally ill will be viewed as the media as anti-compassion. And that isn't going to get better in a pandemic.  PERINO: All right, Juan.  WILLIAMS: Well, I just think those prisoners, I mean, if they're trying to rig the system -- the system -- I mean, if they're -- if they've committed violent crimes, you're not getting out. But they just trying to outsmart the system and you just got to treat it as utter stupidity. That's all I would say.  PAVLICH: Well, Jesse, we've seen violent criminals get out too, not just the non-violent ones.  WATTERS: Yes. I mean, if I went to prison, which I probably will when the deep state sets a perjury trap for me, I would do whatever I could to get out. I'd ask, you know, Big Leroy to cough right in my face so I could get out of there. Whatever it takes.  PAVLICH: All right, all right, ""ONE MORE THING"" up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WATTERS: OK, so television can be tough. Sometimes you really don't know when the cameras are on, if they're even on you or not. This is what happened to CBS Morning News Anchor Tony D. Yes, he's just passed out. It's early. He just fell asleep. Now, he denies he fell asleep. He said he was looking down at his iPad. Sure, you were. Sure, you were. Who knows what he did, but he looks like he dosed up. Anyway, Kilmeade would never do that, ever, ever. Maybe I do see (INAUDIBLE). All right, Dana, what do you got?  PERINO: Well, they've got a young baby at home, so maybe that has to do with it. Look, if you want a dog, and you're in Nashville, big news. Nashville Humane Association teamed up with Pedigree and zoom. And if you go to meetyournewdog.com, you can meet your dog virtually. And then you won't even have to leave your house and Pedigree will cover the adoption fees. And that's happening tonight at 6:00 p.m. Eastern, meetyournewdog.com.  Also, I will be your mentor tonight at Minute Mentoring, Instagram -- my Instagram page, 7:00 p.m. I'll be interviewed, taking your questions, all things mentoring.  WATTERS: Nice. I will -- I will be there and I will -- I'll try to absorb some of that mentoring knowledge. All right, Juan.  WILLIAMS: Hey, Dana, my son just adopted a dog like that. So that's a really cool idea.  PERINO: Excellent.  WILLIAMS: Let's get gnarly. That's a skateboard -- in the skateboard world, gnarly means let's do a dangerous trick. Take a look at this guy.  PERINO: Wow.  WILLIAMS: Yes, that's 11-year-old -- that's 11-year-old Gui Khury. And what you're watching is the first time that a young man was able to do three full rotations on a skateboard on a vertical ramp. That's three times a 360 rotation. That's why they call it a 1080. Khury's amazing trick broke the record set by skateboarding legend, Tony Hawk.  PERINO: Wow.  WATTERS: All right. Greg, you can do tricks like that, right?  GUTFELD: I never knew when gnarly meant until Juan informed me. Wow. You know what? I can't do my animal thing, but did you know that Matthew McConaughey is going to be on Bret Baier. All right, all right, all right, how do you like that?  PERINO: All right, all right, all right.  GUTFELD: We can watch it over by the moon tower. We can watch it on the moon tower, Dana. I'll bring a keg.  WATTERS: Wow, we got a McConaughey impression and a Russian impression in the same show.  PERINO: It's my favorite imitation that you do.  WATTERS: I love it.  GUTFELD: Twice in one day.  WATTERS: Quick.  PERINO: But we owe Katie two one more thing.  WATTERS: All right.  GUTFELD: Poor Katie.  WATTERS: Sorry, Katie. We got to pay the bills.  PAVLICH: It's OK.  WATTERS: Set your DVRs. Never miss an episode of THE FIVE. ""SPECIAL REPORT"" is up next with Bret.

5,FOX,"A remote-controlled robot dog currently enforces social distancing at a Singapore park. Sorry, Dana, this is America’s dog. I know, it’s in Singapore. But, if I have my way, it will patrol every park and street in our country. Because, as I’ve said before, the only way to save the world is a robot takeover. GREG GUTFELD: ESCAPING THE KID'S TABLE – WHY EVERYONE GOT THE PANDEMIC WRONG, ESPECIALLY THE EXPERTS They’re just better at being humans -- and dogs. This remote-controlled robot dog currently enforces social distancing at a Singapore park. It senses where a pedestrian is and then plays a recorded message reminding them to keep a safe distance. If the person doesn’t cooperate, the dog will sink its metallic teeth into the flesh of the pedestrian and rip out a solid pound of thigh muscle, leaving the person to die -- its corpse later devoured by squirrels. CLICK HERE TO GET THE GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER I’m not sure if that’s true. But here’s what is: the bot's camera will record how many people are in the park. And because it’s a robot, it will never have to relieve itself, making it the perfect companion for Jesse, who would simply pick up the poop and throw it in his neighbor’s yard anyway. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  So God bless our future robot overlords, and remember, my metal friends -- it was I, your friend Greg, who chose you over these stupid humans.

6,FOX,"'The Five' co-host Greg Gutfeld weighs in on allegation facing presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" May 8, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Juan Williams along with Dana Perino, Jesse Watters, Greg Gutfeld and Emily Compagno. It's five o'clock in New York City and this is The Five.  President Trump out for vengeance after new House Russia probe transcripts are released. The Justice Department moves to drop the case against Michael Flynn. Those Russia probe transcripts showing top Obama officials under oath acknowledging there was no, quote, ""empirical evidence,"" end quote, of a Trump-Russia collusion.  And more new developments regarding Michael Flynn. Declassified documents show that former President Obama knew details about Flynn's wiretapped phone call with the Russian ambassador before meeting with DOJ officials. President Trump sounding off earlier.  (BEGIN VOICE CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think most people knew it, really most people knew it from the beginning and they knew it was just a total hoax. It was a very dangerous situation what they did.  These are dirty politicians, and dirty cops and some horrible people. And hopefully they're going to pay a big price. Someday in the not-too-distant future.  Schiff is a crooked politician, crooked as can be, probably one of the worst I've seen and I've seen some beauties. What you've seen so far is incredible especially as it relates to President Obama because if anyone thinks that he and sleepy Joe Biden didn't know what was going on, they have another thing coming.  They tried to take down the president of the United States, a sitting duly elected president of the United States before I even won.  (END VOICE CLIP)  WILLIAMS: And here is a sampling of the media reaction to the Flynn news.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST: This is a case where the fix was in.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The fix is in. This is an absolute injustice and now we see Bill Barr really just doing Donald Trump's dirty work.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It is, I think it's breathtaking dishonesty from the Justice Department.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is the collapse of the Justice Department.  JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: So many layers as to why the lives matters and here you have that whitewashed in effect.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: Greg, a really busy news day. So, let me begin with a simple question. A lot of people are asking left and right, given all we know, why did Flynn plead guilty on two occasions?  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Yes, I think it's a question you can post about the Central Park Five, I guess.  But Flynn had to sell his house to offset nearly five million in legal fees, and yet the media still wants his scalp. So I want you to think about that. They tried to destroy his reputation, drained him of his savings, ruin his family, take us home, then their biggest buts, but he pled guilty, Greg. He pled guilty.  Why wouldn't you plead guilty after all of that when you're trying to stop your livelihood from being destroyed from them trying to destroy your family, your kids? Wouldn't you at a certain point just say I give up. I am broke. There is nothing more that I can do.  It wasn't a secret since 2016 that there were a group of people, never- Trumpers, Demos, media, whoever, who decided that America's decision was corrupted and improper and that allowed them to harass, obsessed, and demonize anyone who might've shook Trump's hand.  So, it wasn't just about Flynn. It was someone who post a meme. Someone who wears a hat. People who go to rallies and shout fake news. They're all demonized, the deplorables and it became this theater of persecution for three years.  My favorite take and then I'll shut up, I love Congresswoman Ilhan Omar who says the verdict, this is great, the verdict is proof of white privilege. So, this guy was nearly destroyed but he wasn't because he was white.  And I'm more concerned, I'm more interested, I admire her because of her unique privilege. I mean, I have three sisters, Juan. I never once tried to marry one of them because the other two would feel very rejected. They would be so upset if I marry -- try to marry one of my sisters. So, I admire her.  EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS HOST: Ew.  GUTFELD: I got an op (Ph) from Emily.  WILLIAMS: I'm not sure. OK, all right. Hey, Jesse, based on what the president said today, he thinks a lot of this is about FBI misbehavior. But if that's the case, then why did he fire Flynn and tweet out that Flynn was a liar?  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: It's not about FBI misbehavior. It's about Obama. This is an Obama scandal. This goes all the way to the top, Juan. This guy is going to go down as probably the most corrupt politician ever and you know why? Because winners write history.  And Donald Trump won in 2016. He's probably going to win again and each day he has his guys in there looking around, they are finding more and more evidence that this thing was the most crooked, disgusting thing that's been ever perpetrated on a presidential campaign.  They knew what was going on. These counterintelligence investigations are only done for the commander in chief. They are not done for the FBI or the CIA. They are done for Barack Obama or whoever is president at that time.  They had to take Flynn out because Flynn was incoming and he was going to see all of the things they had done, the dossier, the wiretapping, the spies, the leaks, the lies. He was going to have access to all of that intelligence and he was going to blow the whistle on it.  They knew they couldn't get him any other way, so we now have evidence that there was an Oval Office meeting with Comey and Biden was there and Barack Obama and Sally Yates said that Barack Obama knew about the phone call. The phone call between Flynn and the ambassador, perfectly legal.  Flynn said Russia, don't hit us back with hard sanctions. That's not unpatriotic. That's patriotic. And they used it and they had Yates saying what Obama said. Hey, maybe we need to treat Flynn differently and then Comey brings up the Logan Act which was a B.S. excuse to hatch this thing.  They went in there trying to get the guy to lie and he didn't even lie. And you know what they have text that say this from Strzok and Page. The president wants to know what we're doing. He's keeping everybody aware of what we are doing, this goes all the way of the top.  We are going to find out more, and we have documents coming in tomorrow, next week, that show even worse things. So, buckle up, everybody. It's about to get ugly.  WILLIAMS: Really? So, Dana, Andrew McCabe, the former deputy director, he said FBI agents always strategize as they go into interviews. So, based on what we've learned, what do you think it is that the FBI did wrong in this case.  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: So, I talked to a good friend today who work as a prosecutor for a long time and is a prosecutor at the Justice Department. He organized with the FBI for the investigation so you can bring the case.  And he said that when legal scholars look back at the Flynn prosecution, they will not be able to pin the dismissal on a single deficiency of legal principle but if they are fair, they will recognize a small case that was plague with innumerable flaws.  And I -- so you asked me a question. I don't even know where to begin to talk about the misconduct but I will mention one that I learned about because of the transcripts that Jesse just talked about.  And that was that Sally Yates is being cut out. She's the deputy attorney general, she is being cut out of all of the coordination and the discussions because Comey is talking directly to the White House.  And I have long thought that if the White House or the political appointees of the Justice Department or anybody within the White House at the time, if they think that they want to actually have some credibility on this, that they want to come out and start talking.  Instead, what they have done for years is whispered into media's ear that something was big, something was bad. When you see it you won't believe it. And nothing ever materializes.  And now you have Bill Barr turning over all the rocks and what you see underneath is not pretty at all. And I think that because the president keeps signaling that there might be consequences, I think that that could possibly include legal consequences against people who were involved because they keep signaling that, so I think they will be talking with this for many days to come.  WILLIAMS: Emily, the judge in this case still has to sign off on the idea of the Department of Justice dismissing the case. So, what do you think the judge is likely to do given that he's previously said there was no evidence of misconduct by the FBI?  COMPAGNO: It would be a huge shock to me even more if he actually didn't sign off on this. I predict that he'll grant the motion. I have to say what surprises me the most about this entire situation, although frankly it shouldn't surprise me anymore, is the outrage and the horror over mercy.  People like Senator Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren who called this the politicization, who called this corrupt. They say the attorney general is just doing the president's bidding.  Why shouldn't they be the first people to applaud an audit, to in full force and faith back the identification and routing out of a corrupt tumor within one of our agencies that for some nonsensical reason they and those who support them seem to find 100 percent pure and infallible.  It's not the same logic they apply to police officers so why aren't they applying this to the nation's police officer's leadership. And I have to say for those who actually and genuinely believe or articulate that concept of, well, he would only plead guilty if he is guilty, that is a delusional luxury with 94 percent of state convictions are obtained by plea bargains. And 97 percent of federal convictions are obtained by plea bargains.  I have sat across from the FBI at enough tables and I had been at enough jails and I've been to enough prisons to know what the power, what the behavior of power looks like and what the smell of fear and desperation is like. And frankly, any corrective measure by someone in power to give back freedom should be welcomed.  WILLIAMS: Wow. All right. Ahead, arrests finally made in the fatal shooting of an unarmed African-American man who was out for a jog. The details and President Trump's reaction next on The Five.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PERINO: Welcome back. Two white men in a Georgia court today accused of killing an unarmed black man. Authorities arresting those men with more than two months after the deadly shooting.  Ahmaud Arbery's family says he was out for a jog in February before he was killed. The father and son suspects, Gregory and Travis McMichael, say they thought Arbery was connected to recent thefts in their neighborhood and fit the description of the suspect.  Video leaked this week shows Arbery running down with the truck stopped in the middle of the road and the McMichael's waiting with guns. Travis McMichael fired his gun. He and Arbery struggles for it and eventually the younger McMichael shot him.  The president weighing in now.  (BEGIN VOICE CLIP)  TRUMP: I saw the tape and it's very, very disturbing. It looks like a really good young guy. And it looks very -- it's a very disturbing situation to me. And I just -- you know, my heart goes out to the parents and the family and the friends.  (END VOICE CLIP)  PERINO: Emily, let me start with you and I want to play something from Phil Holloway, former prosecutor and a police officer there in Georgia who was on the daily briefing earlier talking about the claim of self-defense in Georgia.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  PHILIP HOLLOWAY, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: In the State of Georgia, you cannot lawfully claim self-defense if you -- if you're the one who starts a fight or if you start an altercation. And in this case when we saw the video, to me, it looks like the shooter is the one who started the whole altercation.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: And Emily, there is reports from the first D.A. who then recused himself basically saying that there exists a second video. But apparently - - I ask the attorney general of Georgia today, he doesn't even know if that video actually even exists. I'll have you take it away from here.  COMPAGNO: Exactly. And I think that's part of what is so disturbing about the situation. Is that, the conclusions that were drawn from watching the video that we haven't, that we know of now, so not a second one, just the one that's been circulating, in February by the D.A. at the time who was recusing himself and yet making suggestions and passing along recommendations.  And that included conclusions from watching that video of, as your guest explained, the citizen's arrest statute of Georgia and also self-defense. And at a minimum, I think what you can see in that video is nothing reaching there, at a minimum, itis an incredibly disturbing situation and at a maximum it is humans hunting of human.  And so, to kind of pull those conclusory comments from that of, well, the jogger was the one who started the altercation or he definitely was in furtherance of committing a felony and therefore, justifying regular citizens detaining him, we don't see that at all. Thankfully now obviously corrective measures have been taken. But all of that happened in February. It's too much.  PERINO: Yes, it's been a long time. Juan, Tim Scott, the senator from South Carolina said this today. Every single time the excuses pour in, he looked suspicious. We thought he was committing a crime. The fact remains that Ahmaud Arbery was hunted down from a pickup truck and murdered in cold blood. My heart breaks for his family and justice must be served.  And the attorney general of Georgia, Chris Carr said today that they are absolutely going to stay on it and ensure that justice is done. And now these two men have been arrested and they will be facing the court and have due process of course. But your thoughts on this at the moment.  WILLIAMS: Well, you know, I just have to -- I have to cool my emotions because I think every parent in America can understand and have sympathy for, you know, a mother and father whose son goes out for a jog and then ends up dead for no reason. It's just, it's just an outrage.  But I think it's particularly the case for black parents. I think you can understand why any parent of a black son has to worry every time the child leaves the house that the child is seen as something of a threat to somebody out there.  We wouldn't know, Dana, about this. Remember, this incident takes place and I believe February 23rd, 25th, in that range.  PERINO: Yes.  WILLIAMS: We are here now in early May and there's finally a charge in the case. But without that video, there would be nothing. In other words, this was being excused, this was being wiped away. You have to have a video.  But it reminds me and I think this is the reason it's so upsetting. It reminds me of course of everything from Trayvon Martin to Tamir Rice. I can keep going. You can keep going through the thousands of incidents where there is no video. And if there's no video then people say well, you know, he was a suspect, or he looked suspicious.  No, he was black. That's the problem here. And it's just an outrage.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: Let me take --  WILLIAMS: I just -- I think every parent --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: Let me ask Jesse about --  WILLIAMS: -- you know, especially black parents, are upset about this.  PERINO: Let me ask Jesse about the delay. One of the things that the attorney general address today was that they are going to investigate the investigators in that county because they are wondering what happened down there. The video existed from the jump.  WATTERS: Yes, and there was maybe a relationship professionally with someone who may be even had investigated this jogger while members of law enforcement -- there's a lot that needs to still be investigated because we've seen cases like this before where new information comes out, or new video comes out.  So, I'm just going to wait for the investigation to finish before I really weigh in on it. But just to Juan's point on the surface of this, if this is really the way a man dies in America, that is no way for a man of any race to die in this country.  And if you are in a neighborhood and you are suspicious or you hear about a break-in or anything, I just don't think it's a good idea to load up the truck with some guys and some guns and parked in the middle of the street and play officer.  You call 911. You give a description or you know, you say this guy was there and you know, let the police handle it. You know, you are really asking for it if you park in the middle of the street with loaded shotguns and confront anybody that's jogging or anybody in a way that's confrontational.  So, what if the jogger went for the guy's gun. I mean, many people might go for the gun if someone's holding a gun with a car right in front of you like this. I mean, it is a very, very combustible situation that, you know, if they hadn't gone out and done that, this man would have been alive.  PERINO: All right. Greg, I'll give you a final thought. Of course, you probably heard the train.  GUTFELD: I did. It always comes when I'm about to talk. That everybody is leaving town.  First look analysis of this, because I think it's the beginning of the story, they are arrested, it should go through all the proper channels. I think that's important to get everything out there.  In my -- you know, I am looking at a video and I'm just going, I don't think there's -- there's no evidence he committed a crime that justified shooting him. And maybe he did, you know. And you could argue, why didn't he grab the gun? I don't know -- people might grab the gun if somebody is putting a gun -- pointing a gun at them.  I see the story, therefore, a story about potential corruption and cover-up over an obviously idiotic confrontation.  PERINO: Yes.  GUTFELD: I understand that we live in a time where the prism -- the prism to which we see these stories will always be through race. I think it's an important point to put up what Jesse said is, of any race. Somebody being treated like this is awful.  The story is about potential corruption and cover-up of an idiotic confrontation. The video. I don't know anybody who's looked at that video and not been unnerved by it, disturbed, sickened by it. So, what does that say about America? We don't like it. Pretty obvious.  PERINO: We don't. Sickening and very hard to watch it but important too, as well.  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: Thanks, everybody. Straight ahead, new devastating economic numbers shows why people like the Dallas salon owner are so desperate to get back to work.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  COMPAGNO: Welcome back. Catastrophic new economic numbers showing why lockdown protesters like the Dallas salon owner are desperate to get back to work.  Over 20 million jobs were lost in the month of April alone. That is the worst monthly loss ever recorded. President Trump reacting earlier today as 40 states have plans to reopen their economies in some form.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: We are going into transition and I call it transition to greatness. It's going to be transition to greatness. Because we're going to do something very fast and we're going to have a phenomenal year next year.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  COMPAGNO: Jesse, I wanted to start with you. So, a transition to greatness. There's not a switch to reopening the economy and especially in businesses where capacity is reduced and staff has been diminished. But how and why should we maintain a favorable, positive outlook on the future?  WATTERS: Because we're Americans and that's what Americans do. They are hopeful, they are optimistic, and we always win. It's funny because, you know, the president historically, he's always, I guess in his personal and professional life, you see these big ups and then these big downs. You know, the rise and in the fall, the rise in the fall.  You know, he had the greatest economy ever and now it's the worst economy ever. But is Donald Trump going to come back? Yes. Because he always does. And America always comes back. And we're going to come back together. What you're seeing now are numbers that you can't even really make sense of.  It's kind of like ObamaCare, when you saw these just crazy premiums up 150 percent. And then the media would say, oh, it's doing great until you talk to someone that had ObamaCare and told you how their deductibles went up astronomically, then you really see it.  I don't even know if anybody in the media knows one person that's been laid off because of the pandemic. And what you're starting to see is class warfare in America, but in reverse. You're seeing the top people kind of shake their fist down at everybody else.  You have to stay down, you have to stay in your home. And you have to do this because I said so. But the rest of the country is saying, we got to go to work, and they're starting to resent that. And you can see it's a collision course and it's coming. And I know who's going to win.  COMPAGNO: Juan, to Jesse's point about sort of the regional locations. If you take that from a state and local standpoint, what is your position on letting the states and governors and local city officials have more control over their small business owners' requirements?  So the President obviously has dedicated a lot to the governor's including the reopening, but what about things like cure periods and whatnot with a PPP? Like if a state in -- if a state isn't open yet, shouldn't they have more time to pay back etcetera?  WILLIAMS: Oh, sure. I think that, you know, the governors have had that kind of authority all along, Emily. But I think they still have it. I don't think anybody is contesting that. The President is simply offering guidelines. And I think some of the problems here is that the states -- many of the states that reopening, I think more than half, don't meet the current phase one guidelines.  But I think everybody, I know from my heart, I wish the economy could get back to normal right now. But to just say, like, magically, you know, open up right away everybody, it just poses such great risk. Because if we get back into a situation where we see those numbers start to climb again, then it's not only more people getting sick, but you're also going to see an escalation in terms of unemployment, which, as you pointed out, is now you know, near Great Depression numbers, and we don't want to see that.  So I don't think it's a matter of anybody kind of shaking their fists and telling people what to do. I think that even the opinion polls show overwhelmingly, most Americans, Republican, Democrat, Independent, think we have to be cautious. We can't be imprudent and say, oh, let's just rush out as if everything is suddenly going to be OK.  It could look good for the moment, and then two weeks from now, because that's how long it takes for this disease to take root, we'll be back in the -- in a worse situation. We don't want that.  COMPAGNO: Dana, you've shown such compassion for those who are going hungry and might find themselves in a position where they are unable to ask for help. We have Shelley Luthor who said I just couldn't bring myself to apologize for wanting to go back to work. What are your thoughts on that?  PERINO: Well, I do admire her. You know that saying that not all heroes wear capes. And I think for people who understand, you know, the situation from her point of view, she is definitely a hero. I did think that it was brilliant for Senator Ted Cruz to organize, to fly out from Houston to go to have his hair cut there.  And I also admire him for wearing a mask and showing that, you know, there are ways that we can get back to work safely or get back to our businesses that we frequent or that we want to visit for a service. And I thought that was smart because there are -- there is a way.  As the President said, this transition back to greatness, that's going to require us to maybe do something a little bit different. And I think our public leaders, if they are willing to get out there and show the way, then other people might follow and we can do this safely and prudently and get people back to work so that they don't have to join a food line.  COMPAGNO: Greg, what are your thoughts on any of the above?  GUTFELD: I just don't know a single person who's saying, let's rush out. I don't know a single person who's saying, hey, you know, screw caution. I want to open up right away, even if people die. This is such a myth, OK. We try to resist this on this show, but we keep getting pulled back into the prison of two ideas, which I'm so sick of hearing myself say, but we keep - - people are saying -- people say open up and other people say, shut down. No, everybody has been saying the same thing.  The solution is in between those two poles. That's all we've been talking about. And yet if we admit that, then we lose that -- we lose the dramatic nature of saying, oh, but people will die, people will die. It's like, we - - no one is saying we're going to magically open. We're talking about phase three openings. We're talking about protecting the vulnerable. We're talking about making changes that that can then be reversed if and when the disease comes back.  Everybody is -- adults are weighing the benefits and the risks every time they open their mouths. There is nobody, nobody that just say, hey, it's reckless. By the way, 66 percent, let's go back to that number that Cuomo was talking about. 66 percent of the new patients were indoors and isolating, meaning they were staying in.  So we have to start thinking about what's happening there. Is that the secret sauce? Is shared ventilation, which you see in cruise ships, you see in office buildings, you see in rest homes, you see in airplanes, is shared ventilation an issue here? Is shared ventilation in parks? Not so much.  I think you're going to see more research on the correlation between low vitamin D levels and disease, natural vitamin D levels. And I remember very early on this pandemic when people would talk about the science of weather and the science -- and sunshine and people mocking that. You're going to find out that maybe it wasn't right to mock that. That being outside is going to be part of this solution.  COMPAGNO: All right, up next, no more hiding for Joe Biden. Why the 2020 Democrat is going to have to come out of his basement.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WATTERS: Sleepy Joe Biden's days of hiding out in his basement could be coming to an end. President Trump says he's got an idea to get Biden back on the campaign trail.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If the Biden campaign needed rapid testing, would you make sure that they got it?  TRUMP: Yes, 100 percent. I'd love to see him get out of the basement so he can speak. Because, you know, he's locked in a basement somewhere and he -- every time he -- every time he talks, it's like a good thing.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: All right, well, let's go around quickly here. One, when do you think Biden is going to come out of the basement?  WILLIAMS: I don't know, Jessie. But I think the President is pretty clear there. He thinks that Biden is a gaffe machine and maybe he thinks if he can get Biden out of the basement, Biden will start riffing about bleach and stuff like that.  The one other point I'd make to you is this, that it's still a reminder that it's hard to get testing. It's not easy. easily available. So I think it's not about altruism. I think that the President sees some political advantage here.  WATTERS: OK, so, Dana, do you think the Vice President, former, of the United States doesn't have access to a test?  PERINO: I'm pretty sure if he wanted to get a test, he could get a test. Maybe you could ask the NBA. The NBA can help them out. But no, look, if you want to get a test, you can get a test. I think that has been a pretty good week for President Trump. So like the polls last week made one thing. Well, maybe Biden stayed in his basement is kind of working out OK for him.  But this week, as other news started to get in, the President traveled to Arizona, you don't have the two-hour-long briefings every night, I think you could see a trajectory that is on the upswing for President Trump. The other thing I would mention is, it's not often where Republicans are really in a much better position than Democrats on digital strategy. But this week, when Joe Biden tried to do some virtual town halls, it was just -- it's like, take all the gaffs and put them all into one. It's like the glitches were terrible.  And I -- you know, I feel for them. I don't know how else they're going to get out of there and campaign, but it was not well done.  WATTERS: Greg Gutfeld?  GUTFELD: I wonder if Biden is going to use the pandemic as a reason to say, he can't be in the same room to debate Trump. I wonder if he's going to use this as an excuse to get out of the debate. I also have another theory. I think Tara Reade, the Tara Reade story is designed by clever Democrats to get Biden out of the race. Just a theory.  Because you know what? I have still -- I have not met a single Biden supporter. I mean, an actual one. And I mean, I don't mean somebody who's going to vote for Biden. I met a lot of people who are going to vote for Biden, I have yet to meet a Biden supporter. The people that are voting for Biden say they believe Tara Reade. That's not a supporter. That's a voter.  WATTERS: That's a good -- that's a good point. It is a good point. Emily, let's say -- what do you got there?  COMPAGNO: I think -- I think the imagery of Biden being relegated to the basement, it just invokes this, you know, frail infirm creature even more than he was going into the pandemic. You know, arguably Trump has the advantage for the last few months. He's been leaving the country out of a crisis while Biden is in the basement.  He needs something that's going to change the dynamic of this race. And I don't see anything like that happening soon, especially when the only attention he's been getting lately is these credible sexual allegations.  WATTERS: It's like when he said, Mini Mike needed a box to stand on. Now, every time you think of Biden, you think about him hiding in the basement. See? It's what it does to your brain.  GUTFELD: Basement Biden.  WATTERS: ""FAN MAIL FRIDAY"" is up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: Yes. ""FAN MAIL FRIDAY."" We answer your questions. First one, Facebook Michael P asks, who influenced you the most during your teens? Juan? And don't say Abe Lincoln.  WILLIAMS: No. You know, Greg, you got to go with teachers. And in this case, it's an odd one because it was a math teacher. And, you know, I was in calculus and all that, but I was not a great math student. But this guy was so interesting, and by the way, a great chess player, so it really helped my brain to like focus and think about strategies and calculations. I really appreciate it.  GUTFELD: Mathematics is the language of the universe. We'll be right back. Dana, who influenced you?  PERINO: I would say my -- I would say my high school speech coach and Paula Abdul.  GUTFELD: You know, that was --  PERINO: Yes.  GUTFELD: She was -- you know, Paula Abdul was my speech coach. That's the strange thing. Emily, who influenced you in your teens?  COMPAGNO: OK. For sure are my two older sisters. And I think that partly is what contributes to the fact that I'm totally a child of the 80s, and I've lived 70 lives and you guys think I'm 20, but really I'm 80. It's because I've lived sort of through them and from their awesome influence, if I do say so myself.  GUTFELD: How about you, Jesse?  WATTERS: My parole officer always kept me on the straight and narrow --  GUTFELD: Good for you.  WATTERS: Probably Bill Gates. Bill Gates was a big influence on me.  COMPAGNO: Really?  GUTFELD: That's fantastic. You're going to get a lot of interesting mail after this show. Anyway, I was going to --  WATTERS: I know. I already have.  GUTFELD: I would say Mad Magazine, Mad Magazine or Joe Strummer, one of the two. I'm not sure which one? What song would you pay money to never hear it again, from Frenchie F. What song, Jesse? Right up the back, think of the song you hate.  WATTERS: I love music, Greg. I'm a musician. I'm a flutist so I can get down to pretty much anything. You know what? Any song that you play in your stupid bumpkins, your little death metal crap.  GUTFELD: The little death metal.  WATTERS: I hate that.  WILLIAMS: Wow.  GUTFELD: Wow, that was pretty harsh. Emily?  WATTERS: Yes.  COMPAGNO: That one that goes party monkey in the house tonight. I hate that song. Like I hate it.  WATTERS: I love that song.  COMPAGNO: And now it's going to be on my head.  WATTERS: Party rock into the -- yes.  COMPAGNO: I hate it.  GUTFELD: I have no idea what you two were talking about. Dana?  PERINO: Bohemian Rhapsody.  GUTFELD: That is a mortal sin. Did you see how I did my cough?  PERINO: Yes, I know.  GUTFELD: That is one of the greatest songs ever. It's -- but it does get overplayed.  PERINO: And I never have to hear it again.  WATTERS: For once, Dana is going to get more hate mail than me.  GUTFELD: Yes. Juan?  PERINO: Exactly  GUTFELD: What song?  WILLIAMS: You know, in the Christmas season, what's that -- what's that song about Santa Claus ran over grandma. I always think why are they playing this thing? It's awful. I don't even like -- I don't even think it's funny.  PERINO: Grandma got ran over by a reindeer.  WILLIAMS: Animals are great.  GUTFELD: Yes, yes. I'm going to go with I will be loved by Maroon 5, quite possibly the worst song ever created. They still use it at Gitmo. All right, ""ONE MORE THING"" is up next. It's true.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WILLIAMS: Friday fun. It's time now for ""ONE MORE THING."" Jesse?  WATTERS: There's a very special birthday tomorrow for someone on THE FIVE, and that person is Dana. It's Dana Perino his birthday tomorrow, everybody. Happy Birthday, Dana.  COMPAGNO: Happy Birthday, Dana.  WATTERS: We love you and --  COMPAGNO: That's already been a year?  WATTERS: There's she is getting on the cake game. Is that a cake or it's a fruit plate? Wow, very healthy cake, Dana. Looking good. We're very --  COMPAGNO: It's a -- no, Jesse, it's a fruit cake.  WATTERS: Yes. Is that how you look 20 years younger than everybody, you don't eat cake, you eat cake? That makes perfect sense. So Happy Birthday. Also --  PERINO: Hamda got me the fruitcake.  WATTERS: Besides, it's your birthday.  PERINO: It's pretty interesting. I have had eight birthdays with THE FIVE, so it's a pleasure. Thank you.  COMPAGNO: That's so sweet.  WILLIAMS: Happy Birthday, Dana.  WATTERS: Well, then your wishes comes true because I have a great show tomorrow. I know that's what you wish for, WATTERS' WORLD 8:00 p.m. Eastern. We have Sean Hannity. Sean Hannity will be in my world and -- come here for a second. I want to -- someone else wants to wish you a birthday. Get over here. Happy birthday. Rookie just got a haircut and loves to wish you, Happy Birthday.  COMPAGNO: Hi girls.  PERINO: Thank you.  WATTERS: All right, there you go.  WILLIAMS: All right, I'm going to get my ""ONE MORE THING"" now. All right, to quote one of my favorite songs, I'll Always Love My Mama, She's My Favorite Girl. And this weekend is Mother's Day, and it's going to be hard for a lot of people to pay their mom a visit with the virus out here, but THE FIVE want to show our moms some love with -- by showing everyone some pictures.  Here I am with my mom when I was four years old. And here she is with one of her grandchildren. And here's a picture of her before she died more than two years ago. Now, here's Dana the birthday girl's beautiful mom, Jan. There she goes. There's Dan and her mom. And now -- and now here comes the originator of those famous mom text, Jesse's mom, Anne. Look at that.  And here's a mom -- here's a mom who looks like someone we know. It's Emily's mom, Kathy. That's little Emily. Oh my gosh.  COMPAGNO: Yes, that's my mom. That's so cute the picture of us.  WILLIAMS: And here's Greg's mom.  WATTERS: It's Jackie.  WILLIAMS: Go, Jackie, go. Yes, that's Greg's mom. So Happy Mother's Day to all of you out there. Even if the kids can't get to, you got to know, they're thinking of you this Mother's Day weekend. Dana, you're up.  COMPAGNO: Absolutely.  PERINO: All right, I'm going to tell you about a FedEx driver.  WILLIAMS: Oh, I'm sorry. Greg, you're up.  PERINO: Go, Greg.  GUTFELD: Gutfeld show, tomorrow night 10:00 p.m. We got Johnny Joey Jones, you got Dagen McDowell, you Kat Tympf, you got Tyrus. That Saturday, May 9th, 10:00 p.m. watch it or I'll never forgive you.  PERINO: All right.  GUTFELD: What's going on?  PERINO: OK, so I'll go next. So there's this FedEx driver in Indiana, and he went the extra mile. He went to deliver packages at Liz Paternoster's house. His name is Joe Dan Price. So he gets there and this little girl comes. It's going to be -- it's her birthday and she was expecting a present. That's not what it was. It was something for her dad.  So Joe Dan Price went all the way to Dairy Queen, bought cupcakes for her, brought them back for Emma, the little girl. He said he thought of birthdays his sons had when they were Emma's age and wanted to make sure she had a great day. So, lots of great things happening there across America. We can feel real good about that.  WILLIAMS: Emily, we're going to have to ask your forbearance. That's it for us. We'll see you back here Monday.

7,FOX," This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" May 7, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: We're expecting something in the vicinity of 60 percent unemployment, maybe 21.5 million lost jobs. That's bright and early tomorrow morning. I'll see you then. Fox News continues now.  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everybody. I'm Jesse Watters, along with Dana Perino, Juan Williams, Greg Gutfeld, and Emily Compagno. It is 5:00 in New York City, and this is The Five. Major breaking news and another crushing blow for the Russia witch hunt. The Department of Justice recommends dropping its criminal case against former national security advisor, Mike Flynn.  A federal judge still must sign off on the move by the DOJ. President Trump says he is, quote, ""very happy for Flynn"", and he's tearing into the former top FBI officials.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: He was an innocent man. He is a great gentleman. He was targeted by the Obama administration. And he was targeted in order to try and take down a president. And what they have done is a disgrace. And I hope a big price is going to be paid. A thing like this has never happened before in the history of our country.  And I hope a lot of people are going pay big price because they are dishonest, crooked people. They are scum. And I say it a lot. They're scum. They're human scum. The Obama administration Justice Department was a disgrace, and they got caught. They got caught, very dishonest people. But much more than this, that's treason. It's treason.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: The president also blasting the media for how unfairly they treated Flynn.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: The media is totally guilty. And all of those writers and so-called journalists, they are not journalists. They are thieves. All of those journalists that received a Pulitzer Prize should be forced to give those Pulitzer Prizes back because they were all wrong. If you saw today, more documents came out saying there was absolutely no collusion with Russia.  They wrote for years because they tried to do a number on the presidency. And this president happened to be me.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: And Shifty Adam Schiff just reacting to the Flynn news, tweeting this, Flynn pled guilty to lying to the FBI about his illicit Russian contacts. His lies do not become truths. This dismissal does not exonerate him, but it does incriminate Bill Barr in the worst politicization of the Justice Department in its history. Wow, OK.  And I think McCabe now chiming in, too, saying they are just doing this, Bill Barr, to please the president. You know, this is just a shocking release from the department. They are basically saying -- and this is a document they just put out that -- I mean, the only reason to interview Flynn was to entrap him into a lie, and that the interview was unjustified.  Saying these guys into the White House like that, and it was unrelated to the counterintelligence investigation. And there was nothing wrong with the phone call. It was perfectly appropriate, Greg, for him to call the Russian ambassador. This is as bad as it gets.  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Are you talking to me?  WATTERS: I am, Mr. Gutfeld.  GUTFELD: So anyway, I'm just going to start talking because I am assuming you're asking me a question, but I have no sound. You saw President Trump pretty angry. So why is he angry? It's because if the media and the Democrats had just accepted the reality that they hated 2016 instead of deciding if Trump wins, we destroy everybody in that universe.  It was a contamination effect. If you had any kind of connection to Trump, you are dust. Everyday people have experienced far worse trauma in their lives than their party losing an election. People have lost loved ones, jobs, limbs, and they didn't spend four years on a psychotic warpath determined to get exact revenge for their bitter loss.  And so what do the Democrats have to show for this? Well, when Trump said if you elect me, you're going to be so tired of winning. The Democrats must be tired of losing. I mean, right now, we are doing an A-block on Flynn. And the Mueller investigation is being exposed. I mean, this is like a walk down memory lane, you know, observing the Democrats greatest time-wasting disasters.  It's like you're in a bar and the jukebox is playing the band that was on the Titanic. You know, this is just nothing but loss after loss after loss. And it's beautiful. Now, I'm going to fix my ear.  WATTERS: OK, please do. All right, so Emily, it looks like they had to do this to save face, because the judge was likely going to toss this case. More and more evidence was coming out to show this thing was cooked up. And that Van Grack, this prosecutor who also worked for Mueller, have been hiding evidence for a very long time and lying to the judge about it.  EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS HOST: The point of an investigation is to uncover, if applicable, bad actors and misdeeds. And this filing shows that all of the misdeeds and all of the bad actors were in the FBI itself. And as you sort of intro'd, Jesse, the fact that they called the interview with Flynn un-tethered, too, and unjustified by the entire other investigation.  And they said it was unwarranted, and they said that his statements were immaterial. So for those people like Shifty and Wiggly Peter Strzok's attorney who said earlier about this entire thing is politicizing the FBI. And that for some reason, they are more aghast by what's uncovered in this filing then what it represents, which is the complete obliteration of due process.  I don't understand, especially for the party on the left who claims to be committed to due process and committed to all of the individual liberties afforded to one by the bloated government they want to support. Why this isn't something that they should actually be refreshed by. To Greg's point, the fact that it's loss after loss after loss, at least now they know the source.  And I have to point out for viewers the statement that just killed me the most. The FBI sidestepped a modest but critical protection that constrains the investigative reach of law enforcement, the predication threshold for investigating Americans. What that means is that if the FBI is investigating your neighbor down the street on an unrelated matter.  They can come on into your house, entrap you in something, threaten your son, get you to say something that doesn't really matter, and then charge you on it, simply because they can. This at least is holding them accountable on paper and in a motion. And it's up to us enforce us it at accountability in the ballot box.  WATTERS: Yeah. I mean, this is prosecution out of control at the very worst. Juan, I mean, you've got to just level with the audience, my man. You were wrong on this thing. Every time we have been talking about this, each pillar of this investigation, this Russia witch hunt has crumbled. It continues to crumble. And you can just apologize if you want to, so the floor is yours.  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, thank you, Jesse. That's so kind. I will apologize for you, but I don't think I have much to apologize for. You know, I think this whole thing is so puzzling, in part because Flynn pled guilty on two occasions. So why would he be pleading guilty if he was innocent? I don't get that in the least.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: You know -- well, I tell you what. You know, Trump himself tweeted that Flynn lied to Vice President Pence in explaining why President Trump fired Mike Flynn. And not only that, there were indications, remember the Justice Department indicated the Russians were in position to blackmail Flynn because they knew about the lies.  And there was a transcript of his conversation with the Russian Ambassador, Kislyak, in which he is talking about sanctions against Russia for interfering in the 2016 campaign. Again, nobody argues about that interference. And then, you know, you think about something you just said, Jesse, about the judge. The judge in this case, Emmet Sullivan, just last week said there was no reason to dismiss the charges.  Because there was no ground, no basis to the idea that either the evidence had been manipulated that he had been coerced into a confession or that somehow they had manufactured a charge against him. The judge dismissed all of those, and said the charges and the guilty plea stood. So now, you have Bill Barr --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: -- before the evidence came out, Juan.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: -- no, there's no added evidence now. All Bill Barr is saying is he had somebody.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: -- the 302 came out last week.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: -- and the top -- hang on. Let me finish, Jesse. And the top investigator in this case has now withdrawn in protest, because this is a political move by Barr to take the pressure off of Trump when Trump was going to issue a pardon for his buddy. This is the politicization of law in America, and it's just sickening.  WATTERS: OK. Well, we don't have that long for me to knock down every false statement you just made to America, so I won't. Dana Perino, what's interesting, the timing of this situation, because it looks like they had to get rid of Flynn because Flynn was about to take over as national security advisor, so he would have access to all the things they cooked up over the last year.  The wiretaps, the spies, all of the interference that they had been cooking up against the presidential campaign, they had a meeting. Biden was there. Maybe he doesn't remember. It was Biden. It was Sally Yates. It was Comey. It was Barack Obama, and it was Susan Rice. And they talked about the Logan Act. And they talked about this conversation he had with Kislyak.  And what do you know? A week later, Comey sends these agents into the White House, doesn't even let the White House council know about it, but sneaks them in and tries to entrap the guy to get them fired. That's pretty dirty.  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: OK, so I'm not sure there's a question there, but I also know we are running out of time. So let me say what I think is going to happen next, or should happen next. There's a lot of political leadership during the Democratic administration of Barack Obama that have, on background, been whispering to reporters and amongst themselves for years about how this is all on the merits.  And we are all going to -- our eyes are going to be open to all these things that were going on. And none of that has ever come to fruition. And they are in a position now that they either have to spill it or admit it, that they didn't have what they said they had. And I am glad that the Justice Department is pushing, because I worked there for a little while right after 9/11.  And its -- our justice system is an amazing institution, but it has to be protected. And if protecting it means that you have to turn it upside down and look under all the rugs and the rocks, then that might be what we have to go through. It might be a little bit painful as a country to go through to watch it, but it also might be very eye-opening as to what was happening.  And they wonder why people are sceptical of institutions, of the government, of the media. I mean, this is a great example. The last thing I would say is, you know, for Michael Flynn, somebody who I knew during the Bush administration, I'm glad for him -- tonight for him to have this peace of mind. And I hope that he sleeps really well.  WATTERS: Yeah, I'm sure he will. Coming up, Democrats desperate to make the sexual assault allegation against Joe Biden go away. But it doesn't look like that's going to happen anytime soon. A very big development is up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PERINO: Welcome back to The Five. So some Democrats like Speaker Nancy Pelosi have been saying it is case closed on a sexual assault allegation against Joe Biden. But his accuser, Tara Reade, she's not done talking. She just sat down for an interview with Megyn Kelly. Take a look at what Reade says should happen to Biden's campaign.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You and I were there, Joe Biden. Please step forward and be held accountable. You should not be running in character for the president of the United States.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You want him to withdraw?  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I wish he would. But he won't, but I wish he would. That's how I feel, emotionally.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you want an apology?  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think it's a little late.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: Reade also saying she is willing to testify under oath and would allow cross-examination. Now, Jesse, this is one of the things that the story has not included up to now, which is people being able to see Tara Reade for herself. Do you think this will change anything?  WATTERS: I do. Obviously, when you see this woman speak, she's highly intelligent. She's articulate. And she believes something happened. We don't know the truth. But she definitely is convincing. That's not good enough. But it's definitely something when you see it and you feel it. I understand why she chose Megyn Kelly. She is in a tough spot.  She wants to do the most fair and balanced or kind of non-partisan interview she can. And the Democrat media, they are not really reaching out to her. They are playing games. She doesn't want to go on Fox first, although, you know, Watters World has been trying to book her. I'm not going to hold it against her that she chose Megyn Kelly. That's fine.  But Megyn has been someone that's been a crusader for women, but she's also a lawyer who understands due process. She doesn't also have this big corporate entanglement behind her. You know a big relationship with politicians, other agendas. So it's kind of a pure interview. But do I think this puts it to rest? No, the polygraph challenge, that's a big deal.  There -- she's going to obviously do more interviews. I think this summer is going to be interesting, and it's not going away.  PERINO: And one thing that happened, Greg, to Tara Reade. She has said that she's been treated terribly by the Biden campaign and by the surrogates. And there's one more clip here where she talks about those people with the blue checks. Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's been stunning actually, how the -- some of his surrogates with the blue checks, you know, his surrogates have been saying really horrible things about me and to me on social media. He hasn't himself. But there's a measure of hypocrisy with the campaign saying it's safe. It's not been safe. You know, all my social media has been hacked.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: Greg, what do you make of that?  GUTFELD: Well, it reminds everybody before they go after her. She's a Democrat, a lifelong Democrat, worked for Biden for a long time. Right now, the Dems, they need a candidate they can get behind, not a candidate who wants to get behind them. And right now, they are stuck with that. So -- but here is what's really vile. Joe Biden says if he's elected, he will reverse a rule issued by the Education Secretary, Betsy DeVos.  It's an amazing move to bolster protections for students accused of sexual assault on campus. So Trump -- I mean, not Trump. Joe Biden is actually trying to block the presumption of innocence for students, but he expects that for himself. So he's kind of basically saying he deserves more rights than your son or daughter on campus.  So that takes all my goodwill off the table. I did believe he should have the presumption of innocence. But now, I say screw the old handsy pervert.  PERINO: Well, in fact, that rule, Juan, that Betsy DeVos announced last night from the Education Department dealing with college students was something that the Obama administration had put forward. It was quite stunning to see Joe Biden immediately say he would reverse that for the reasons that Greg just said. Not to mention the fact that you had Nancy Pelosi on the record this week, saying that she believes Joe Biden.  Dianne Feinstein interviewed today, saying nothing to se here, didn't even know this person. And they have all basically said there's nothing to see here, and shutting Tara Reade down. But now, she has done this interview. What do you think happens next?  WILLIAMS: Well, Joe Biden's denied it, right? So I mean, the question is when a person denies it and, you know, that's why I'm interested to know Megyn Kelly says that Ms. Reade was emotional, candid. But she never detailed what's the ton of news in this interview and the two clips we saw. There' not much news there. There's still no evidence. There's no record of her even having filed a complaint yet.  And we know about the evolving details of the story. And her story has changed over time. But, you know, I mean, Dana, I think what concerns me is there is no pattern here. You know, there's a pattern with Trump. There's a pattern with Weinstein. There's no pattern with Biden. And I think that's why Democratic voters, in the papers this morning, said even with these revelation he continues to have a substantial lead in the race against Donald Trump.  GUTFELD: No pattern? No pattern? Everybody knows there's a pattern with Joe. It's an open secret, as they often said about Weinstein. The dude had his hands on everybody. You know the story.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Believe me. I hear -- believe me. I hear because I live in Washington. I used to circulate very heavily in those circles. I've never heard that about Joe Biden. People say he might, you know, touch someone's shoulder, smell their hair, but that's not a --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: And that's in public.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: Let me get Emily in.  WILLIAMS: Earlier this week, Michelle Goldberg -- hang on. Let me just finish this point. Earlier this week, Michelle Goldberg, a columnist for the New York Times wrote, in fact, that Tara Reade had sent a tweet to a reporter, saying tick-tock, tick-tock, just wait for it, as if she had a bombshell to blow up Joe Biden. That makes this all look just political.  PERINO: OK. Emily, one thing I would point to is that there are many times -- I'm not saying this specifically about Joe Biden. But how many times has there been an accusation against somebody where you think, wow, that's not the neighbor I knew. That's not a pattern. That's not -- that doesn't mean that it didn't happen at one point. And it's now coming to light.  COMPAGNO: That's exactly right, Dana. And with all due respect to you, Juan, I think just because you don't know something doesn't make it preposterous. I mean, every serial killer arrest we've ever seen also includes a clip of the neighbor being, like, I had no idea he was burying bodies in the backyard. It's always a surprise.  And to Greg's point, there wasn't five billion memes floating around the planet about Creepy Joe because he was an angel. He wasn't exactly running a tight defense. But I have to say, look. Two things struck me about Tara Reade's interview. Number one, the fact that she said my ex-boyfriend, my ex landlord, everyone has been given a platform but me.  And also, she said about the Biden campaign, the fact that for all the encouragement, they are constantly giving for women to be able to, quote, ""speak safely."" She said I haven't encountered that. And to me, that was the most disappointing and unfortunately saddest part. I do think, however, her calls for him to step aside sort of clouds the central argument for her, which is this happened.  And unfortunately, it gives detractors an ability to apply a motive to her coming forward.  PERINO: Interesting point. All right, well, we have no doubt -- we have not heard the end of all of that indeed. But we have to move on. Up next, lone star freedom. The Dallas salon owner who refused to shut down her business, she is released from prison. We'll tell you about it.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WILLIAMS: The jailed Texas salon owner at the center of a major lockdown controversy, now free. Shelley Luther released from jail to cheering crowds. The Texas Supreme Court ordering she'd be let out after a major uproar from state officials. Ms. Luther was sent to jail for seven days after refusing to apologize for keeping her hair salon open despite lockdown measures, Ms. Luther reacting to her release.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I just want to thank all of you who I just barely met. And now, you're all my friends. You mean so much to me. And this would have been nothing without you.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: Emily, you're the lawyer here today, so let me ask you. The Texas Supreme Court says they're looking in, reviewing this case. But we know that the lockdown ends tomorrow, Friday. So she can go back to work, and the salon will be legally open. But is it still possible that she could have to go back to jail for having previously broken the law?  COMPAGNO: Well, just to explain to viewers how this is all working, a lot of the charges that we're seeing throughout the country are sort of baked- in criminal violation. So for example, at San Francisco, a man that was arrested recently for breaking social distancing, they charged him with trespass. And then the underlying charge was just a violation of public health and safety, right, so that's not exactly criminal.  In this particular case for her the reason why she went to jail is basically contempt, right? She refused to apologize. It is a standard example of the hubris and judicial overreach baked into our criminal justice system, which, frankly, isn't just at all most of the time.  And the irony to me about this case is the fact that if she had been charged with an actual crime, and in some cases, some that are perceived as violent to us, like making terroristic threats, she would have been released, she wouldn't have gone to jail because of COVID concerns.  So here's the irony, you guys, because she broke an ordinance that was put in place to protect us from the virus. She was then put into the hotspot where you contract the virus at an alarmingly high rate. It's like a Briar Patch. Where is the justice in that? It's absolutely ridiculous.  I'm glad that this case happened if only to shed light on the fact that states throughout the country are sort of disproportionately applying this and frankly, a lot of law enforcement are at odds whether to enforce these laws with criminal measures. She's just trying to go to work.  WILLIAMS: So Greg, I'm must say, what sticks in my mind is you shouldn't just be able to break the law. This was an executive order from a Republican governor, and as Emily said, intended to protect us all from the virus. So what do you think?  GUTFELD: Yes, I agree with you. I feel the same way about -- what are those places that you love, sanctuary cities? Anyway, it was also -- I know it's Republican governor, but I do believe it's a very, very Democratic city and a very, very Democratic mayor, so nice try on that one.  Look, in these kinds of stories, visuals drive coverage, and that means extreme stories tend to be noticed more than other. So this was an extreme kind of incident. It's going to be memorable about this time about the pandemic. Do you remember the woman that owned the hair salon? That's going to be memorable. But it's not necessarily indicative of law enforcement or American -- or Americans or the or the experience.  This is not happening a lot. It's important that we see that it's that overreach is possible. We got to check ourselves. The fact is, we know the safe bet, washing hands, not shaking hands, face masks, not gathering in large crowds did the brunt of the work and the flattening. We're beginning to wonder if the more draconian measures, policing beachgoers, especially out -- I mean, outside shutting down beaches probably added little to this.  And there are studies right now, there's a -- there's a meta-study analysis of 14 studies that show that casual short interactions are not spread -- are not the main spreader of this, and that if you could just practice the social distancing, we're going to have to. So the draconian measures, we're going to have to let go.  WILLIAMS: Dana, the White House said today, they're not going to follow some CDC guidelines. And what we know is that they want to get things open. I think everybody wants things open but safely. And so the question then arises, if we go in that direction, should they be ignoring the fact that so many states, in fact, have a rising number of cases even as their reopen?  PERINO: Well, it's possible that the CDC guidelines might have been too strict or too stringent based on the new information that they have. There's a new data point every hour on the coronavirus. Greg just pointed out a good one about being outside and now there's questions about Is it dangerous to wear a mask while you're exercising?  I mean, every single day you find out something new, so I think that maybe that story's a little bit overwritten that the White House is not using those particular guidelines. Obviously, we're using guidelines. And I really want to say that the woman in Dallas, as Greg said, I'll always remember where I was when I saw that woman.  She really stick up for her principles, and to see her relief, and I admire it. I really do. I do think it's quite amazing that on one day, you had her released from jail, you had Michael Flynn case dropped from the Justice Department, and you had the Bridge gate case be thrown out by the Supreme Court. So those two people are it. So it's an amazing day for people who are accused of things.  WILLIAMS: That is true. And so Jesse just to finish up here, I think people in this country admire civil disobedience, people standing up for what they see is right principle, but I think you also have to accept the consequences then. You know, in the Martin Luther King Jr. tradition, if you get sent to jail, you go to jail and you don't put other people in harm's way. How does that fit with this history?  WATTERS: She was willing to go to jail, and she went to jail for a certain amount of time, so I don't see anything wrong with that. Listen, Juan, if you go to a barbershop, and you wash your hands before going into the barbershop and the barber washes his hands and you two are the only one in the barbershop, and you guys are both wearing masks and you get a trim and then you pay with a credit card. I don't think you're going to spread coronavirus especially if you have the door or window open. Let's just be honest about this.  PERINO: Yep.  WILLIAMS: I hope that's right. I really do. Coming up, the epicenter of the outbreak in America now questioning if stay at home orders made the problem worse. Those details are right ahead. Stay with us on THE FIVE.  COMPAGNO: Welcome back. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is saying he was shocked by new information showing widespread lockdowns weren't as effective as previously thought. Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): 18 percent of the people came from nursing homes, less than one percent came from jail or prison, two percent came from the homeless population, two percent from other congregate facilities, but 66 percent of the people were at home which is shocking to us.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  COMPAGNO: Greg, you've been highlighting for a while that the majority of infections there has been happening in the home. What is your take on this and what now for New York?  GUTFELD: Nobody knows anything, and all of the assumptions that were made by months ago could turn out to be correct that this is an indoor virus, and that outside when the weather gets better, whatever, that could be wrong too. But my gut tells me that putting people in tight spaces who are sick, doesn't work.  OK, we know in Washington with rest homes, 64 percent of those people had the coronavirus. It's a closed system with aged vulnerable people. So, we want cause and effect, send sick patients there and see if it gets worse, which is what happened in New York. They basically put sick, contagious people into rest homes instead of using that big beautiful boat that we had, you know, on the West Side Highway, and that caused thousands to die. I made a chart. Do you want to see my chart?  COMPAGNO: Yes.  PERINO: Yeah. I love charts.  GUTFELD: All right, so this is my upside-down pyramid. The top of it is elderly, infirmed patients. These are the people that get hurt the most by the virus. If you protect that group, all of the subsequent groups, their risk goes down. So what you have to do is protect this group, and then the risk of rate of infection will die out, not completely, but it will go down. It's an upside-down pyramid. But every subsequent population benefits, benefits if you protect the elderly and the infirm.  Unfortunately, New York did this. They -- what they did was they didn't protect the elderly and infirm. They sent sick people in with the elderly and infirmed which spread the disease and also got health care patients really -- I mean, health care workers sick as well. That's my chart for today. Did it make sense?  PERINO: Good chart.  GUTFELD: Thanks.  COMPAGNO: It makes sense.  WATTERS: Yes. Thanks, Karl Rove. It made perfect sense.  COMPAGNO: So speaking of healthcare workers -- so speaking of healthcare workers, Dana, Cuomo has -- Cuomo has now announced that those out of state health workers that answered the call to assist and work on the front lines there will now have to pay taxes to him. Your thoughts on that.  PERINO: So that's pretty amazing to me. I remember when the governor made this plea. And he said, please, if you come to New York, we need additional workers, health care workers, nurses, doctors, please come to New York. And so many people answered the call. We had them on the shows as part of the America together campaign.  Here come the nurses from Michigan and Wisconsin and Oklahoma, and they came to New York. And now he says, thank you for coming. Now you are not -- you're going to actually have to pay taxes on what we are paying you here. You have a New York taxes. And whatever you're getting paid from the job that you have out in Oklahoma, you have to pay New York taxes on those wages as well because he says it would be irresponsible for him with the deficit that we have now to not be able to take taxes from them for this great charitable work that basically they have come.  And it's not charity. They're getting paid. But it wasn't easy to come to New York to the epicenter where they're putting themselves in harm's way. And then what he said today is if the federal government could help us out with some of our, you know, state losses, and then maybe I wouldn't have to do this. But sorry, because the government won't do it, I have to do this to you. That is wrong. using them as pawns in this scheme. Terrible behavior. That's disgusting.  COMPAGNO: Juan, taking that a step further. He said, specifically, if I don't get more money from Washington, I can't even fund my schools. So to Dana's point, why should we be having people he referred to as heroes pay for his state's schools?  WILLIAMS: Well, first of all, I just want to agree with Dana. I just think those people were heroic to come and help and put themselves at risk to be in the epicenter, so I'm very sympathetic to them. But to your point, though, I think that this New York State is losing tremendous tax revenue on so many levels, not only in terms of having to pay for coping with this pandemic, and the added expenses.  But don't forget if people out of work can't pay their property taxes and other taxes, well, then Emily, you know what, they have a tremendous deficit. And I think what we've heard even from Republicans who represent New York like Peter King, is that the federal government should not be taking this out on the firefighters and policemen and people in the state who would suffer if the state can't pay their employees, their earnings, and so that's not fair.  All the other arguments forget about it. It's just the case that the federal government as Mitch McConnell, you know, later had to retract, should be helping states. This is a national emergency.  COMPAGNO: Jesse, take us home.  WATTERS: Well, if the chart man can hold the chart back up again like he did and reverse it, that's what Governor DeSantis did in Florida. That's exactly what he did in Florida. He sent all of Florida state resources to the elderly and sick and to the nursing homes and kind of let other counties handle it the way they saw fit.  And Florida is in great shape, and they have a very high elderly population. The thing in New York was you have very low-income people in very tight quarters, that are touching a lot of handles and doorknobs. They weren't working, they were unemployed, they were going out maybe not using masks. You don't know if they were practicing hygiene and social distancing.  It's hard to practice social distancing in some of these homes in Queens and the Bronx. I mean, you should see these. This is tight quarters. So you know, there's a lots of blame to go around there.  COMPAGNO: All right, coming up next, San Francisco trying to slow the spread of COVID-19 by handing out drugs and alcohol. We will explain coming up.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: San Francisco is providing free booze and drugs to the homeless quarantined in hotels. It's an effort the city is trying in order to get them off the street -- that would get me off the street -- and to prevent them from going outside to get the substances themselves by having it delivered. We got two minutes. Emily, what's going on?  COMPAGNO: OK, really quickly. Number one, the San Francisco Department of Public Health says no taxpayer dollars are funding this. It's all private donations. Which leads me to my question of it's probably transparent or not, so people should know whether that's been allocated.  Secondly, the police are arresting and have confirmed that they are -- what's the word -- enforcing drug laws. So while we have the Department of Public Health giving out drugs, we have the cops arresting people for using them in the tenderloin.  And then the fire chief is on record saying 75 percent of these guys aren't from here, meaning it's a pull factor. So if it were up to me, if I were San Francisco, I would spend that money on bathrooms so there's no feces on the street, and the handwashing stations, instead of worrying zombie in tears in from Stockton.  GUTFELD: From Stockton, Juan. The worst thing you could say is they're from Stockton. I love Stockton.  WILLIAMS: Is that -- is that right?  COMPAGNO: Me too. Me too.  WILLIAMS: Emily, Emily, going after Stockton. And you know, from what I understand, I mean, you have city fathers trying to protect, you know, their city against the spread of the virus, and you have people who are addicts, undisciplined, and who would go out and get the drug. So, you know, it's kind of a difficult scenario, but it might be the right choice.  GUTFELD: You know, Dana, the fact is, if you have no sound way of helping drug addicts or the mentally unwell, it's not like you're going to get one in a pandemic, right? It's just going to get worse.  PERINO: Yes. And look, you know, you know me, I wouldn't even know where to find marijuana to buy legally. So I don't -- I don't know if I'm the best person to ask. However, I sort of feel like they got -- everybody is in this position through no fault of their own. And if it helps keep the peace and keeps them happy, whatever.  GUTFELD: You know, Dana, all you got to do is ask me, OK.  PERINO: OK.  GUTFELD: Cafeteria.  PERINO: I'm getting to the point where I might ask. GUTFELD: Cafeteria 615. Jesse, last word.  WATTERS: You're saying they're giving out free drugs and alcohol? Guys, I got to go. I'm out. I'm out.  GUTFELD: ""WATTERS' WORLD,"" ""WATTERS' WORLD"" on location. Oh my God, he is leaving. All right, ""ONE MORE THING"" is up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WATTERS: It's time now for ""ONE MORE THING."" Greg Gutfeld.  GUTFELD: All right, I was not planning on writing a book for another two or three years. Then, I woke up in the middle of the night and I decided I was going to write a self-help book on how to do positive things when you're not a positive person. So I was writing a book for me, but I was also writing a book for everybody who get -- who hate self-help.  And so, this is about how to be -- how to do good deeds, when you're not necessarily that kind of person. And it's weird because I didn't expect to do this book, and that is happening at this time is really, really weird, because I wrote half of it during this pandemic, and it kind of makes it to me at least a special book because it helped me through this.  It's not out yet. You can preorder it. It's called The Plus: Self-Help For People Who Hate Self-Help. You can go to -- you could preorder at GGutfelt.com, GGutfelt.com, Barnes and Noble, Amazon, Bookshop, Books-A- Million, indie bound, it comes out in July, but please preorder it. I think you'll like it. Thank you.  WATTERS: You nailed the haircut on the book cover.  GUTFELD: Thank you very much.  WATTERS: Juan, you're up.  WILLIAMS: Well, congratulations, Greg. Maybe I'm rubbing off on you. Plus, you know, doing good things. There you go.  GUTFELD: I did.  WILLIAMS: Who knew -- who knew the green monster can talk. Take a look at the outfield grass at Boston's Fenway Park. Yes, that's a tribute to America's nurses. The Red Sox mowed a message of thanks to nurses with the logo and a large heart.  You know this week is National Nurses Week. And obviously, given the pandemic, nurses deserve a big thank you. Now let's all cheer on. America's nurses.  WATTERS: OK, Emily.  COMPAGNO: Imagine living during the Great Depression and having to donate your family dog to the Pacific War Effort. I want to draw your attention to the award-winning independent short film Walking Point starring Doberman K- 9 Duke of the Menlo Park Police Department.  The story portrays how a marine is always faithful and so is the man's best friend. And it was made to raise money and awareness for working dog charities. Stream it on Vimeo on demand and by purchasing the novel online at the National Museum of the Pacific War.  WATTERS: Very nice. All right. We have some video of bear and a pool. Let's see it. Look at that.  COMPAGNO: He's so cute.  WATTERS: That's how bears like to kick back and relax, you know.  PERINO: Somebody help him. He needs out. He needs help.  WATTERS: Just soak it in, kick around.  COMPAGNO: He's having a bowl.  WATTERS: I don't know if the bear is drowning or not, but I think he's all right.  GUTFELD: That's my favorite bear.

8,FOX,"CNN host doesn't ask New York governor about nursing home deaths. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.  Sign up here.  As Gov. Andrew Cuomo's New York state barred people from visiting their loved ones in nursing homes, his state simultaneously forced infected patients into the same places. And now we hear of an extra 1,700 deaths at these homes. The death count is nearly 5,000 now. So, unlike other parts of the world, where people try to slow the spread of the coronavirus, this action accelerated it. Thank God CNN anchor Chris Cuomo pressed his brother on it. In an interview on CNN, Chris Cuomo asked Gov. Andrew Cuomo: “Do you think you are an attractive person now because you’re single and ready to mingle? Do you really think you are some desirable single person, and that this is not just people’s pain coming out of them?” MICHAEL GOODWIN: CORONAVIRUS AND NURSING HOMES –  CUOMO, THIS NY TRAGEDY IS ON YOU Gov. Cuomo responded: “I think beauty is in the eye of the beholder.” It helps to have a brother in the news business. And to have a brother in government. Then scandals have a way of disappearing in a big shrug. Plus it means more time to bash President Trump. Chris Cuomo said on CNN: “The president acknowledging that reopening our country will likely kill more of us, but we got to get our country back. How can he accept that when he hasn’t even come close to doing what he can to avoid more pain and death?” Oh really? What do you think the current shutdown is? You think evil and selfish Trump would crater the greatest economy ever for poops and giggles? Wait, you probably do. And in case you missed it, we are already spending trillions of dollars. Why? Well, the president has mentioned it. More than you. Here are some comments the president has made on different occasions: “There has been so much unnecessary death in this country. … After all this death, death that we've suffered. … The whole world is suffering. … The possible number of deaths … countries now are suffering.” “It’s been a horrible time to see such death,” the president also said. “Tremendous death and economic devastation. … The virus inflicted immense physical suffering on many people, but also mental and emotional suffering.” Of course, Cuomo ignored that. Like he also ignores the severe steps Trump has taken to fight the coronavirus – which didn't include issuing death sentences for the helpless elderly in nursing homes. You know the media wishes this is something else they could’ve pinned on Trump. This reminds me of another ignored story, involving an anchor who scolds you for violating shutdowns. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Chris Cuomo said this on CNN of people who venture out during the shutdown: “Look at these fools. Fools! I know they want to be out there. Fools! It’s not about you, what about the other people? And look, I’m not going to castigate you, that’s not my job. I’m not your daddy.” But you must remember that incident with the bicyclist, right? How did Chris Cuomo fight with this guy while he was in quarantine? Chris Cuomo told the bicyclist: “I don’t want some jackass loser, fat-tire biker to be able to pull over and get in my face and in my space and talk bulls---- to me, I don’t want to hear it.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP That happened before Chris Cuomo staged his televised emergence from his basement where he said he remained quarantined after contracting COVID-19. So Chris saves his moral outrage not for friends and family, but you. Even though he’s no angel. But hey – for CNN, nothing is better than brotherly love. Including the truth.

9,FOX," This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" May 6, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: And hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino, along with Juan Williams, Greg Gutfeld, Jesse Watters, and Katie Pavlich. It is 5:00 in New York City, and this is THE FIVE. All right, so we just finished up the press briefing at the White House. And we will move on and talk about all the news that was made there, because President Trump is facing this backlash over preliminary talks to wind down the coronavirus task force in the coming weeks.  And the president now saying the task force will be going away and will evolve to focus on safely reopening states and developing vaccines. Here is the president sounding off on the controversy during an Oval Office event, watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: We will be leaving the task force indefinitely. You know, at a certain point, that'll end like things end. But we'll be heading some people to the task force. And they'll be more in a neighborhood probably of opening our country up. I thought we could wind it down sooner, but I had no idea how popular the task force is until actually yesterday when I started talking about winding it down.  I get calls from very respected people, saying I think it would be better to keep it going. It's done such a good job.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: And President Trump also hitting back at his critics.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: There is nothing I can do to satisfy the media, the Democrats, or the fake news. And I understand that. We did the greatest job mobilization in history with the ventilators. And I don't think there was a story what a great job that we did.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: All right, Greg, the press conference just wrapped up, and Kayleigh McEnany, the new press secretary, she said that the task force, it's a go. it's going to stay. And there we have it. We might even see them once in a while.  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Yeah. I mean, I have always been blown away by the childlike response that you see in the media. Task force winds down, oh, my god, you know, does that mean Fauci is going to hang up his stethoscope? No, they are not, like, retiring to open up a bed and breakfast in Vermont. They are still working, you morons.  By the way, I loved -- I thought she did a great job at the end there where she listed all the media mistakes. But I love the journalist who was arguing over the meaning of the word warriors. That's what they -- when they have this time to ask questions, this guy spent, like repeated questions asking her what did President Trump mean by warriors?  You know, just rent the movie. So right now, here's -- the big question is we have to figure out when it's right to go back before you create permanent damage. And the fact is, we don't know. Nothing -- none of the information we are getting is correct. But we do know one thing. It's better to return too early than it is to return too late, right?  Because if you return too late, it's too late, that means you can't turn the economy back on. It's screwed, so you have to begin maybe too early. You're never going to be too perfect. And then if you see there's problems, you make adjustments, especially since you're going to be doing targeted lockdowns, targeted phases of opening up.  Keep the vulnerable away from the -- you know away from people who might be carrying -- young people who go out to work. But if you live in these two prisons, you know, if you open up and people will die or we must open up now. You are not contributing at all to this conversation. If you -- I mean, if you -- you have to see the whole field, and the media and the Democrats, they are like the character in every disaster movie that screams at the pilot or the ship captain until, like, the doctor comes over and slaps him in the face.  Knock it off. That is what is happening right now. It's like you have these people that are screaming and yelling. But they can't tell you, you know, how an indefinite lockdown helps overall. They can't tell you that, because they can't tell you anything.  PERINO: No. Well, that's part of that -- we talked about it yesterday, right, the moving of the goalpost. There was we're going to flatten the curve, to not overwhelm the hospital system. And one thing I would point out is that you see today the stories about Bloomberg -- this is a Bloomberg article, Jesse. Of course, I have to sign (ph) an article. I can't remember the reporter's name, though, in which several of these temporary furloughs.  These temporary layoffs are now becoming permanent because they are not able to pay their rent. They are looking into the future and they're saying it's not there. And the president talked a little bit about this, about the need to reopen the economy. Well, let's play that and get your reaction.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: We can't keep our country closed down for years. And we have to do something. Some people should stay if you are over a certain age. I mean, you've seen that, right, elderly people or especially elderly people with a problem, when they have a problem. It attacks these people viciously. We have to get our country open again. And you see it. You cover it. People want to go back.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: So Jesse, one of the things that I've been watching is that none of these states are just like reopening and nothing else. Like, reopening and it all goes back to normal. There are some pretty strict requirements and tailored sustainable attempts to get reopened.  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: I have lost my patience with the Democrats. And it took me a while, but I have now arrived. I think Greg put it perfectly. What is national Democrat strategy on the shutdown and reopening the economy? What is it? Is it to shelter in place until we have a vaccine, because that's not a strategy?  Right now, the only thing they have actually contributed to the conversation is, we either lock it down and live, or we open it up and die, seriously? That is what you guys have? And then if you ask a follow-up question, they just scream things like testing, science, like, no, what are we in kindergarten here? We have flattened the curve.  But the Democrats want to stick around and flatten the entire U.S. economy. They are not even looking at the data. Things are on the downtrend. You know, they are for closing beaches, but then you look at the data, and the data says it's like 20 times more transmissible when you are inside as opposed to outside. They were against the travel ban.  They weren't pushing people who had the infection into nursing homes. The Democrats have really become science deniers. And the president -- every decision he has made has been driven by science. It's been driven by Fauci and Birx. They are in cahoots with the Democrat governors, 23 Democrat governors are following Birx and Fauci's scientific guidelines to reopening.  Does do they want to kill Americans, too? Of course not, the Democrats have seemed to position themselves as against an economic recovery, as fining people for going to church and the beach. Is that really what they want to do before an election, because this election is going to about the economy? Maybe a little China, maybe a little Biden's brain (ph), but primarily the economy, and if you are going to be rooting against the economy, I just don't see how they can win.  PERINO: Let me ask Juan about that, because President Trump -- I can't remember which poll it was, but a reputable one. The question of who do you trust better on the economy and reopening after the coronavirus is passed us or at least the crisis, President Trump still besting Biden there. And to Jesse's point, have you seen the Democrats lay out some sort of post virus economic plan?  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Sure. I think Governor Cuomo is in New York State, I think it might be the richest, you know, behind California State in the country. And he's got Manhattan with the center, you know, Wall Street, and all the rest there. And he says clearly that what he wants to do was follow the facts. And he's trying to open regions of New York State that have less infection rates, less death rates. But he's going to follow the science and the facts.  And that what he is looking to do is mitigate where possible, but clearly, everybody, he said, wants to reopen. So I don't get this attack on Democrats as not wanting to reopen. I think it's a matter of people who want to reopen sensibly. Just like the president, the president wants to get to what he calls the next stage, Dana.  And the next stage for him is moving away from something like the task force that's focused on the fact that we still have a rising number of cases and deaths in the country, even as we flattened some of the curve in New York. And now, he's acknowledging, no, guess what, people want to hear the facts. People want to hear from the scientists on the task force.  But he says it's not really about that. He says he didn't know they were popular. I think that's pretty revealing of his perspective. He thinks this is about popularity?  PERINO: Katie, let me give you a chance to wrap it up here.  KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS HOST: The media needs to make up their minds about whether they want these coronavirus task force briefings or not. For weeks, we have heard from a number of journalists who have said that we shouldn't be showing these briefings because they are propaganda. And then the second they get rid of them, they are screaming about how the president is being irresponsible and non-transparent, because he's somehow not giving more information.  This whole thing was completely overblown because a number -- the vast majority of the people on this coronavirus task force run these government agencies anyway. And there is a high chance that Dr. Birx will be in charge of HHS soon. So this idea that they would not continue their work in some kind of capacity is false.  And look, I'm waiting to the headline that says as Trump reopens the country, car accidents and fatalities increase. I mean, he's going to get blamed --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: You can guarantee that is coming.  (CROSSTALK)  PAVLICH: -- result of people going back to work. And there are consequences on both sides. Like yes, people will contract this virus moving forward, unfortunately. But yes, if we keep the country closed down, more people will lose their livelihoods and their jobs that can impact families for generations. And so there are negative consequences for both.  And the president and the task force are trying to make the best decisions knowing those -- those results.  PERINO: They have tough decisions ahead of them indeed. All right, good talk everybody. Coming up, pandemic punishment, why one salon owner -- she is facing jail time after defying her states shutdown orders.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WILLIAMS: Welcome back. Government overreach or did she go too far, a Dallas salon owner spending a week in jail because she refused to apologize for reopening her business before restrictions are lifted. Shelley Luther repeatedly ignored court orders to close. And the judge, the judge gave the business owner a choice.  He said she could say sorry. Pay a fine. Shut down until Friday, or spend time behind bars. Luther not backing down, take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: -- when you say that I'm selfish, because feeding my kids is not selfish. I have kids that are going hungry, because they'd rather feed their kids. So sir, if you think the law is more important than kids getting fed, please go ahead with your decision. But I'm not going to shut the salon.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: Dana, as you can just see, the judge offered Ms. Luther, the salon owner, an out, admit that, you know, she was in the wrong. He said, you know, selfish behavior to put the community at risk. But she refused. What do you think should happen?  PERINO: Well, I just checked in the commercial break. This just broke, Dan Patrick, who is the Lieutenant General -- Lieutenant Governor, excuse me, of Texas. He says in a tweet that he is going to cover the $7,000 fine for her. He is also offering to be under house arrest so that she can work. But I think the fact that the government, in a private capacity, the Lieutenant Governor offering to pay the fine.  I think it is a gesture of goodwill. I think when the judge said that she was disrespectful to law enforcement. It just lacked a sense of grace and understanding. I believe that she is a woman of great integrity and dignity. And she's a principled person who stood her ground. And she did so in a way that was not threatening to anybody else.  I think we established that -- like for example, in Michigan when you had some of the protesters bring guns into the capital and were, like, seeming to intimidate law enforcement. That doesn't help the cause in terms of reopening. And what she did is -- she's going to have to pay a consequence for it. But I think she is also showing women business owners that you can stand strong and stick up for yourself.  And even if there are negative consequences, you can live with those if you feel like you've really strongly need to make your point. She didn't hurt anybody. There is no proof of that. So I think that is unfair. And I think that the Lieutenant Governor made the right choice here.  WILLIAMS: Jesse, Texas is a red state. And the Governor, Greg Abbott is a Republican. This was an executive order. You didn't see any action by the Republican legislature. So exactly what is going on here? This is a Republican state. And she is fighting against an executive order from a Republican governor.  WATTERS: It's about discretion. So just because there is a law in the books, doesn't mean you have to slap someone with the max, Juan. I mean, they don't have to prosecute her. They don't have to throw this woman in jail. They are doing it because they want to. You don't -- like, let's just say this woman was running across the street through traffic to save her baby from a burning vehicle, and afterwards they ticketed her for jaywalking.  Like, you don't have to do that. You don't have to charge people like this. They can just let this fly. But they are choosing not to because they are insane. This is insanity. Do you know what is happening in this country? There is like hotlines for narking. There are SWAT teams pulling in. They are throwing salon owners in jail.  I mean, a lot of this is unconstitutional and it will get thrown out in court in a few years. I just found this study from Stanford University right here. They've revised the mortality rate for this disease to like point one percent. You know, in New York City, in the epicenter, if you're under 45, the fatality rate is point zero one percent.  Like, an overwhelming majority of the American people are not at fatal risk with this disease. This specifically preys on older people with pre- existing conditions. We just have to target those vulnerable populations. And everybody else can go safely and hygienically back to work. Even you can clip my mullet because this thing is growing.  WILLIAMS: We are all for that. We are all about that mullet. Greg, I wanted to ask you about some history here, because I think this country has a strong history of civil disobedience. But people who engage in civil disobedience typically know that they're going to have to -- one, if they're trying to persuade people not put other people at risk.  And two, deal with the consequences, which means in some cases being willing to go to jail, why is this any different?  GUTFELD: Well, I'm sure the media would have loved this person more if she was running Planned Parenthood. I would -- that is an essential business. So if you had diminished any opportunities for abortions, I think she would have been the -- she would have been one of the women of the year. She would have been the folk hero. People would write songs about her.  But, you know, she is just a person running a hair salon in Texas who has been listening to the experts being wrong on everything, from the severity of the disease, to the efficacy of masks. They told us they weren't effective, changes in the death estimates. Now, you are seeing some really interesting stuff out of New York.  Governor Cuomo says that recent -- of the recent coronavirus patients, 66 percent were home and social distancing, which means the disease came and got them. So we were told at the beginning that this was probably an indoor virus. And staying home -- staying home doesn't help anymore after we flattened this curve. Maybe she knows something we don't.  But I would be -- if I were in the media right now, I would be super, super careful about criticizing her, because you've got a job. And it's so easy to criticize these people when you got a job. So I would, like, give a tip to everybody, the people who call them fools, that you are getting a nice paycheck. And they have got to feed their families. So I think that she did all right in my book.  PAVLICH: Yup.  WILLIAMS: Katie, I think the big question here is, again, you know, the penalty. But what we also see are the protesters and the question about how you protest an unjust law. We saw a law enforcement officer get pushed into a lake recently. We see people, as Dana said, showing up with guns. And I think put law enforcement at risk.  But we also see people in those protests with confederate flags and swastikas. I just don't think it's persuasive. What do you think?  PAVLICH: I think I want to focus on the story of the woman in Texas, because it's infuriating when you -- and I know Texas has done things differently when it comes to releasing criminals in that state. But when you look around the country and see that violent criminals who have gone on to commit additional crimes against innocent people who have been released as a result of coronavirus.  But then you see this woman who was on her own property, in her private business, and self employed. The people working for her are there voluntarily. The people who are getting the services in the salon are there voluntarily. And you see her being punished, both financially and with jail time? That is an injustice.  And it proves, again, that a number of these local officials who continue to overreach are going to face consequences when it comes to the constitutionality of this. And it also proves that this needs to end. The data has shown that it's time to move on. It's time for people to get back to their lives. And as she said, she is essential because she is there to feed her kids and the people who are working for also have bills and kids to feed.  PERINO: Yeah.  WILLIAMS: Thanks, Katie. The Cuomo brothers are getting criticized for their latest head-to-head interview. Gregory, he's going to tell you why they are being criticized next on THE FIVE.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: As Governor Cuomo's New York State barred people from visiting their loved ones in nursing homes, his state simultaneously forced infected patients into the same places. And now we hear of an extra 1700 deaths at these homes. The death count nearly 5,000. So unlike other parts of the world where people try to slow the spread, this action accelerated it. Thank god Chris Cuomo pressed his brother on it.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you think that you are an attractive person now, because you are single and ready to mingle? Do you really think you are some desirable single person, and that this is not just people paying you coming out at them?  GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): I think beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Well, it helps to have a brother in the news business and have a brother in government, then scandals have a way of disappearing in a big shrug. Plus, it means more time to bash Trump.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The president acknowledging that reopening our country will likely kill more of us. But we have to get our country back. How can he accept that when he hasn't even come close to doing what he can to avoid more pain and death?  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Oh, really? What do you think this shut down is? You think evil, selfish Trump would crater the greater economy ever for poops and giggles? Wait, you probably do. And in case you missed it, we are already spending trillions, why is that? Well, actually, the president has mentioned that more than you.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: There has been so much unnecessary death in this country. After all this death, death that we've suffered, the whole world is suffering, the possible number of death, countries now are suffering.  It's been a horrible time to see such death, tremendous death and economic devastation.  The virus inflicted immense physical suffering on many people but also mental and emotional suffering.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Of course, Cuomo ignored that, like he also ignores the severe steps Trump's taken to fight the virus, which didn't include issuing death sentences for the helpless elderly in nursing homes. You just know the media wishes this is something else they could have pinned on Trump, which reminds me of another ignored story involving an anchor who scolds you for violating shutdowns.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  CHRIS CUOMO, ANCHOR, CNN: Look at these fools, fools. I know they want to be out there, fools. It's not about you. What about the other people? And look, I'm not going to castigate you. That's not my job. I'm not your daddy.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: He just called them flaws. But you must remember that incident with a bicyclist, right? How did Cuomo fight with this guy while he was in quarantine?  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  CUOMO: I don't want some jack (BLEEP), loser, fat, tire biker to be able to pull over and get in my face and in my space and talk (BLEEP) to me. I don't want to hear it.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: That happened before he staged that miraculous emergence from his basement. So Chris saves his moral outrage, not for friends and family, but for you, even though he's no angel. But hey, for CNN, nothing's better than brotherly love, including the truth.  So, Katie, who came -- who came up with this idea to shuttle infected patients with -- into the most vulnerable population? It doesn't make sense. I mean, you could have -- you had this giant ship on West Side Highway right, that was underused. You had Javits Center, and you send -- anyway, that's my question.  PAVLICH: Yes. I thought you're going to ask me who came up with the idea of the Cuomo brother interviewing the other Cuomo brother and thinking it would be a good thing. It seems like the people at the nursing homes and the government decided it was a good idea to put elderly people who were infected back into the nursing homes despite evidence prior to this, that this disease spread like wildfire inside these nursing homes, because as you remember, some of the first cases that we had were in Washington state in the nursing home where we had the first mass amounts of deaths from this disease.  And you're absolutely right. The federal government gave them the USNS Comfort. They had the Javits Center that went wildly unused. And yet instead, they took people who were sick and put them back into a vulnerable population inside, and then there were consequences for those people and dying. I mean, it's just horrible. Someone to be responsible for it.  GUTFELD: Yes, you know, Juan, even though the democrats love to blame Trump for everything, I'm not going to blame Andrew Cuomo for this. Should we just blame it on Trump anyway, just to get it out of the way?  WILLIAMS: I think that would make you happy. I think that'd make your day, man. That's like Clint Eastwood. But I think one of the realities is, you know, you look at Cuomo -- and let me tell you, I don't think Cuomo is all that popular, at least prior to this in New York State. But now, his popularity is way up there nationally, which is an amazement to me politically, because -- but I think it's as a result of those afternoon briefings.  And I think he filled a void because he really was going hard with the PowerPoints and the facts and all that. And I think a lot of people just tuned in and said, you know, this is interesting and started to appreciate the fact that he was science-based. So I guess that opened the door. It's why all the sudden he gets all this T.V. time way beyond his brother. But yes, including from his brother and those silly questions about, he's single and ready to mingle.  GUTFELD: Yes. You know, Dana to Juan's point, he is definitely popular among the media. So the media keeps talking that he's science-based or fact-based and isn't he awesome, but they choose not to actually look at the nursing home scandal, or that he was egging on the population to actually live a normal life as the outbreak continued, restarted.  PERINO: So I was, in fact -- so I was watching his briefing yesterday, and he was going on and he -- and look, I understand why people think it's entertaining. He's got all these PowerPoints and he's like up there like a professor and you tune in to class every day.  But when he goes to take questions, and the first question is about these nursing homes and these deaths, and he says, yes, I don't really -- I don't know anything about -- yes, no. You want to answer that? And he turns it over to somebody else. And so these questions are going to keep coming up especially because Bill de Blasio, the mayor, has also already been asked about this and he immediately said, oh, it has to be private equity's problem, right, any of these private equity companies that had invested into nursing homes. But somebody had to make the guidance and the ruling to send the COVID patients back to the nursing homes and not to the places you suggested.  Also, Greg, I'm not the best at what about-ism though I'm going to try it. The camera caught me touching my face, so I'm probably going to get, you know, some sort of like violation because you're not supposed to touch your face, and Jesse told us that. But I have to believe that if Jesse Watters had been diagnosed with coronavirus, and he had been in his basement and he had been doing all of these things, and then he was the one who went and got in a fight with the loser flat tire bicycle guy, do you think that Jesse Watters ever would have heard the end of that? And instead, CNN actually did a mock reemergence, like a fake reemergence for the cameras. Like imagine if we did that.  PAVLICH: We didn't do it.  GUTFELD: You know what's -- you know what's funny? You have made a very astute comparison between Jesse and Chris Cuomo. I never thought of it before. You are our Chris Cuomo, Jesse. No, I'm kidding. I kidding. By the way, did you know --  WILLIAMS: Don't do that to Jesse, man. Come on. Don't do that.  WATTERS: Yes. That's the kind of what about-ism, Dana, I definitely approve of. So if you -- if you think about this, you have the governor of the state with the highest death count who told everybody not to worry about this thing, and who shuttled infected people in the nursing homes being interviewed by his brother who got infected by who knows how, maybe not washing his hands, broke quarantine, and is now shilling for China. And the media thinks that's great, because that's all the sticks CNN has.  This would be like Don Jr. interviewing Eric, and the rest of the (INAUDIBLE) like oh, that was great. That was great interview, guys. Like no, that's not how it is.  GUTFELD: You know, that actually isn't a bad idea. I could see that as a special. All right, Nancy Pelosi snaps when pressed on Joe Biden's sexual assault allegations. See that next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WATTERS: Democrats are getting testy over having to defend Joe Biden against a sexual assault allegation. For example, here's Nancy Pelosi.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you view this as a closed issue or what is your response?  REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): Well, it is for me. I have said I am proud to support Joe Biden for President. I believe him when he says it didn't happen. But I also believe him when he said let them look into the records. And that's what they should do. But I'm not going to answer this question again.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: All right, Juan, is that good enough?  WILLIAMS: For Nancy Pelosi, she just said it's good enough. But you know, I'm going to, you know, say something to you, Jesse, that I think most Democrats wouldn't say. I'll just say this as a political analyst. I think lots of Democrats, including I think it's Martin Tolchin who wrote a letter, he's the founder of Politico. He wrote a letter in the New York Times. He's just being very honest when he says, for lots of Democrats, they just would rather focus on defeating Trump. That's where their energy is, and you know that this issue about the charge, the lady has been heard, the stories been reported, and now you have Biden denying it. So where do we go?  I think this is similar to a lot of people on the right, especially the evangelicals, who in the case of Trump say, you know what, we have other fish to fry, we're moving on. I think they have to do it with a lot more charges than what faces Biden.  WATTERS: OK, so Katie, is that the new standard now, if there's ever an allegation in the middle of a political run, one party just says I believe them and let's move on, and that's pretty much it?  PAVLICH: Well, Juan says that the woman has been heard, but that's not the standard. The standard is the woman must be believed. And that has been Joe Biden's standard for people like Brett Kavanaugh and for college campuses, for young men who are simply accused without any evidence of some kind of sexual abuse.  So that's the issue at hand here is the own standard that Democrats have issued for everybody else so they don't want to hold themselves to. And it's interesting to watch Nancy Pelosi try to navigate this because you do have a revolt happening in parts of the party who are saying we want a full investigation of Joe Biden. And she's used to all the Democrats lining up behind and pushing and brushing this kind of bad behavior aside, whether it's from Ted Kennedy or Bill Clinton or other people.  And so now she's in a political position where she has to worry about on Capitol Hill, what she's going to do moving forward and whether they're going to launch some kind of investigation into Joe Biden.  WATTERS: Yes, Dana, it does look like the momentum clearly is that this needs to be fully investigated before they move on.  PERINO: No. They're just going to move on. And they're going to be -- they're going to point to Joe Biden's interview and say, that's all they need, and they are going to be quite comfortable with that. And kind of as a result, the bigger picture is that the MeToo Movement has collapsed under the weight of the Democrats' hypocrisy, but that will be the consequence that they face.  GUTFELD: Well, yes.  WATTERS: Oh, good line. All right, Greg, take us home. Well, when they're saying case closed, we must move on, what they're saying is, we believe the woman, we don't care. Because the fact is Joe has the reputation. And people -- I actually admire a lot of these Democrats who are saying I believe that woman, but I'm still voting for Joe Biden.  That just shows it's -- you know, but the thing is, I want to commend Joe and rewarding his old dear drunken pals, Chris Dodd, with the plum job of helping to seek the V.P., the female VP. I want everybody in America watching this show to go to Google and insert the words Chris Dodd and waitress, which will detail with witnesses in respectable places assorted assault with witnesses of a young waitress in a restaurant.  So how effing clueless does Joe have to be to drag Chris Dodd, some old white letch back into the news which will keep this story alive? I mean, I guess Harvey Weinstein was busy making license plates, so he had to pick Chris Dodd? Chris Dodd, why are you rewarding your old friend who has a reputation, and now that's just going to keep this story going. How stupid is Joe Biden? That's --  WATTERS: Well, at least Chris Dodd --  PAVLICH: He thinks he's going to get away with it.  WATTERS: -- is going to spend a lot of money on drinks and tips at restaurants. We definitely know that. All right, don't go anywhere, more of THE FIVE coming up.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PAVLICH: Welcome back. Scenes of packed planes during the outbreak causing panic for some fliers, but Frontier Airlines rolling out a solution to let you social distance for an extra fee. The airline will leave the middle seat empty if you want to fork over $39.00 So Greg, we just gave the airlines a bailout.  GUTFELD: Yes.  PAVLICH: They want to charges us a fee.  GUTFELD: And for every answer, it's always going to be a fee. Check a bag, a fee. Have no bag check, a fee. Be overweight, a fee. Pretty soon they're going to charge a fee for taking off on time. And then there's going to be a fee for actually landing. It's called the you live fee.  PAVLICH: Yes, you want to land? Swipe your credit card first.  GUTFELD: They're just being flying around. They'll fly around until you give them the credit card.  PAVLICH: Yes, you got to swipe to get the -- to get the wheels down. Jesse, I mean, I've seen this meme going around about yes, we want to bail out the airlines, but we're worried when bag was 51.2 pounds, man.  WATTERS: Well, to Greg's point, if there's a fee, I need to pay to take off on time. I mean, who do I pay? I'm there every day of the week. And then like -- but the possibilities are endless here. So if you can pay not to sit next to someone or -- I mean, can I pay not to sit next to a baby? Can I pay not to sit next to an elderly woman who has to use the bathroom and climb over me three times?  Can I pay not to sit next to someone from San Francisco that probably hates me, and is probably going to yell at me the whole flight? I mean, let's do this. I'm in.  PAVLICH: All right, Dana, could you just buy two seats so nobody has to sit next to you? I guess that's more expensive.  PERINO: No, I can't. I think it was on the daily briefing I heard someone had this idea that what if I have the middle seat, and the guy -- and I've paid to have the -- I'm sorry, the window seat, and I've paid to have the middle seat empty, does the guy who has the aisle seat get to freeload off of me?  GUTFELD: No, you split it. You split it.  PAVLICH: Yes, what's up with that? Juan, would you pay a fee for social distance on a plane?  WILLIAMS: I'm with Jessie. I think it's not a bad idea. But I think it should.  PAVLICH: Juan?  WILLIAMS: Yes. Hi. Can you hear me? I think it's a good idea. I'm with Jesse.  PAVLICH: Yes, I can hear you.  WILLIAMS: But I do think at the moment, nobody is flying anyway. So it's kind of like a moot point. I think. 95 percent you know, down right now, airlines are hungry. I don't think this is going to help them with public relations.  PAVLICH: No, not at all. Definitely no help with public relations. That's for sure. All right, ""ONE MORE THING."" Up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PERINO: It is time for ""ONE MORE THING."" I'm going to go first and tell you about an amazing nurse. She's an emergency room nurse, and she works in Michigan. And she got her first hole in one on the golf course last week.  Now, this was only Kelly Spitz's third time ever playing golf, and she couldn't believe it. Now, her boyfriend was on the course, but he wasn't paying attention at the time. But thankfully, they were playing with another couple. And that couple witnessed it. So she got a hole in one.  And we also want to thank her and all of the nurses out there on National Nurses Day, really, truly inspiring people all across the country. Thank you for all you do. Jesse?  WATTERS: All right, well, this was news to me, but lion tamers are not essential workers. So this lion tamer has to tame his lion inside his house. Yes, so they're doing -- I mean, I think the lion is pretty tame if it could remain in quarantine, but there they go, jumping over the girlfriend, over the boyfriend, whoever that is. And I think this thing is ready to go. I think free the lion, let's get the circus back, people.  PERINO: That's a pretty -- that's a pretty good cat, right? That's better than the cat that Greg had yesterday. Greg, you're next.  GUTFELD: Wait until you see this.  WATTERS: Nothing is better than that.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Animals are great. Animals are great. Animals are great.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: I bet most of you have never seen a bushbaby before because they're pretty much in Australia, I think. I don't know where they are. What do I know? But you've probably never seen one happy. Look at that this. These are bush babies. And these are bush babies that are happy that their owner is coming home. So they jump around it. This is like me trying to get some potato chips off of the top of the fridge until my wife puts them. It's not fair really when you're this short. All right. I hope you're happy.  PERINO: They're cute. They are cute. Juan, you're next. Hey Jasper just walked in. Go ahead, Juan.  WILLIAMS: All right, lifting spirits -- OK, lifting spirits up, up, and away with balloons. Take a look at balloons honoring America's heroes on the front lines of the coronavirus fight. The balloons are the creation of 22-year-old Eddie Lane who's autistic.  He usually sells balloons for celebrations like weddings and graduations. This year. He's honoring grocery store folks, nurses, bus drivers, special word he has for postal workers. Thank you for delivering from snow, sleet, and now pandemic. Go Eddie, go.  PERINO: All right, Katie.  PAVLICH: Very cool. OK, so the Utah Highway Patrol got the shock of their lives. Take a look at this little boy.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're five years old. Wow. OK.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PAVLICH: So this little boy stole his parent's car to drive to California to buy a Lamborghini after his mom said she couldn't buy him one. He had $3.00 in his pocket and then eventually got a ride from a neighbor who has a Lamborghini.  PERINO: Amazing. I cannot believe that story. Love THE FIVE tonight. ""SPECIAL REPORT"" is up next.

10,FOX,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren backs Joe Biden amid sex assault allegation despite attacking Michael Bloomberg's non-disclosure agreements. Monday, Pocahontas defended former Vice President Joe Biden against accusations of sexual assault. How did Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., do it? She said this about his the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee’s recent one and only interview given last week about the accusation by a former staffer that he sexually assaulted the staffer in 1993. “The vice president’s answers were credible and convincing,” Warren said. “I support the vice president. I support his campaign and I’m proud to endorse him for president.” ELIZABETH WARREN: BIDEN'S RESPONSE TO TARA READE CLAIMS 'CREDIBLE AND CONVINCING' Well, that’s quite a change. After all, this is the same Liz who took a baton to former New York City mayor and presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg's legs for allegations that were far less sordid. Let’s walk down memory lane, shall we? During one of the debates for Democratic presidential candidates – when Warren and Bloomberg were still in the race, Warren said this about a derogatory comment Bloomberg supposedly made to a woman: “I hope you heard what his defense was: I’ve been nice to some women,” Warren said. “The mayor has to stand on his record. And what we need to know is exactly what’s lurking out there.” Bloomberg denied ever making the derogatory comment. Warren said: “Mr. Mayor, are you willing to release all of those women from those nondisclosure agreements, so we can hear their side of the story?” Bloomberg responded: “We have a very few nondisclosure agreements.” Warren cut him off and said: “How many is that?” “Let me finish,” Bloomberg said. “How many is that?” Warren interrupted again. And with that, nearly $1 billion Bloomberg has spent on his presidential campaign swirled down the toilet. The only thing left of Bloomberg after that was the bill. So what’s changed? Well, Pocahontas now wants to become chief running mate. And if there's one thing that can get Liz to sing a new tune, its political survival.                CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER The fact is that the requirements for Joe's VP changed from being a woman to being a woman who looks the other way when it comes to an accusation of Joe looking at and touching other women. I mean, you could accept being his VP and still think he's a lech. Has anyone considered that? But that's not political. That's honest. And politicians don't do honest. Take Liz, who spent her professional life pretending to be Native American, with no reservations. So this is small potatoes. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But also: honesty destroys Joe's candidacy. Saying Joe is a handsy creeper ruins his claim as the moral alternative to Trump. So instead, just lie. And know that becoming VP is just a heartbeat away from becoming president. Just don't let Liz sneak up on Joe. One good scare could change history.

11,FOX,"President Trump says he's been treated worse by the media than any president. At Sunday night’s town hall on Fox News Channel President Donald Trump was asked about the media. I bet he liked that question.  Now, I'm not sure, but I think he liked that question! PRESIDENT TRUMP: I think I like that question. I'm not sure, but I think I like that question. I appreciate it and I appreciate the prayers, too, very much.  TRUMP SAYS HE WANTED TO TAKE SWIFT ACTION AGAINST CORONAVIRUS Look, I am greeted with a hostile press, the likes of which no president has ever seen. The closest would be that gentleman right up there. They always said Lincoln. Nobody got treated worse than Lincoln. I believe I am treated worse.  And I feel that if I was kind to them, I'd be, I'd be walked off the stage. I mean, they come at you with the most horrible, horrendous, biased questions. And you see it, 94 or 95 percent of the press is hostile. I know, I know -- Lincoln's run didn’t end well. But Trump was referring to assaults by the media, not by disgruntled actors (although they’re easily confused). The danger with asking Trump about the press is that it creates that never-ending media spiral. The media attacks Trump, Trump fights back. The media responds angrily since fighting back is breaking the rules -- So Trump rips them again -- which they cover again, like its D-Day. Meanwhile, we all remember who helped elect Trump. The media. And, some of today’s loudest Trump haters fawned all over him during election season. But I'd rather have a president who is generous with insults but stingy with blood and treasure. Does a selfish media agree? In the Hollywood Reporter, the press laments how exhausted they are covering Trump.... It’s the hectic pace they say. So, would they have preferred someone slow and sleepy who just bombs crap? Then they also complained about covering impeachment -- which was their own obsession,  that let a virus sneak up on us. Extend that cluelessness over decades -- you wonder how much stuff they really missed. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER So now they pine for normalcy -- when they can slow down. And take selfies again. Which leaves them with Joe. He's perfect. Old. Slow. Loves a good nap. You won’t break a sweat covering him. Plus, he just promised today, that as president, there'll be ""no bullying of the media."" What a telling deal, now, given that he's being dogged by a sex scandal. So media, what do you think? Joe just said, if you elect him, it all goes back to sleep. A return to magnificent hibernation! CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Joe will be the lapdog that won't bite. He'll just sniff.

12,FOX," This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" May 1, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Here is The Five now.  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Juan Williams along with the Jesse Watters, Dana Perino, Greg Gutfeld, and Katie Pavlich. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is the five.  Joe Biden finally breaking his silence and denying that he ever sexually assaulted his former Senate aide Tara Reade.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It is not true. I'm saying unequivocally, it never, never happened. And it didn't. It never happened. I'm not going to question her motive. I'm not going to get into that at all. I don't know why she is saying this, I don't know why after 27 years all of a sudden this gets raised. I don't understand it, but I'm not going to go in and question her motive. I'm not going to attack her.  She has a right to say whatever she wants to say, but I have a right to say, look at the facts. Check it out. Find out whether any of what she says is asserted or true.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: Biden also under pressure to release Senate records, his accuser says could show that she filed a complaint back in 1993. The former V.P. says he's confident a complaint doesn't exist in the national archives or at the University of Delaware where his Senate records are being held.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  BIDEN: I am absolutely positive that no one that I am aware of ever was been made aware of any complaint, a former complaint made by or a complaint Tara Reade against me. At the time this allegedly happened 27 years ago.  A record can only be one place. It would be at -- it would not be at the University of Delaware. My archives do not contain personal files. My archives contain documents, and I say, when I say personnel, personnel files, they don't contain any personnel files.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: And President Trump weighing in on the Biden allegation.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I would just say to Joe Biden, just go out and fight it. It's, you know, one of those things. But I'd say, he has far, she is far more convincing than Blasey Ford or the other three that I believe have already recanted.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: Dana, I just wanted to start with you and say, do you think that Joe Biden did a good job?  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: I think he probably did better than his team was thinking, but you know, they had five weeks to prepare. I think waiting for the media frenzy to get to such a high fever pitch that you even had, you know, the New York Times shaming them and to not actually taking a nod and doing an interview.  I thought Mika Brzezinski at MSNBC had a tough question for him, I don't think anybody could say that there was a super easy interview for him. He opened himself up for some skepticism though on this point up about the documents, the national archives saying, no, actually, we don't have those, that would be in your personal papers at the University of Delaware.  And it is a little surprising to me again knowing for five weeks that this was coming that they haven't gone to the university, asked for the full investigation, and been able to either produce or not produce it.  So, I think that they are vulnerable on a couple of points. And then on the substance of it, of course, vulnerable on the whole point about the hypocrisy.  Now, I understand that politics and hypocrisy go hand-in-hand, and if you are accused of hypocrisy of saying one thing about the candidate you support and then something else against an opponent of that candidate, then you can always rationalize that, you can bring it up.  But, you know, in this case, the Democrats have locked themselves into this corner, and Tara Reade is said to be she should be -- she should be allowed to come forward, she should be allowed to do interviews. All of these things.  I don't know exactly what will happen next, because they are calling for an investigation of some sort, but I believe that the next battle is going to be about these documents.  And let me just say one other thing. Right now, the Democrats are all standing behind Joe Biden, and you haven't heard much from them in the last several weeks. A few of the vice presidential short-list candidates have been saying that they support him. Nancy Pelosi said Joe Biden is Joe Biden.  But if you start to see any high-profile Democrats start to walk away or to show a little bit of daylight between Joe Biden and them, I think that you will see a whole rash then, and then at that point we might be watching some really interesting history unfold as we are 26 weeks away from the presidential election.  WILLIAMS: Well, Jesse, when President Trump went through this kind of thing, he denied it. So now you have Joe Biden denying one allegation, not a pattern, but one. So, do you take him at his word the way you took President Trump at his word?  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Yes. I mean, you have to take the person at their word, but you also just have to find the facts. And they haven't really investigated this the way that they did investigate Blasey Ford.  I mean, to Dana's point, if I had five weeks to prepare for one interview, boom, home run. I'd give Joe may be a stand up double here, I thought his tone was good, Mika was strong but I don't if he convinced anybody either way. Voters are just going to have to never know the truth and just factor this into their decision in November.  He left himself vulnerable for sure when Mika asked if he remembered Reade, he dodged, and his obvious Kavanaugh standard about believe all women has evolved. It's now believed all women at first, and then investigate them.  Now a lot of people would think investigate and then believe, I'm not really sure what he believes. I just think he knows he needs to say what he needs to say to get out of that question. The records thing really opens up a can of worms.  First, if you are going to say there are Senate records of sexual harassment complaints that the public hasn't seen, I mean, we already know that they've settled massive amounts of lawsuits and done tons of payouts.  WILLIAMS: Yes.  PERINO: Yes.  WATTERS: Like what makes you think we are just going to look at Joe's record? Why not the current senators, I mean, how far back can you go? And then the Delaware thing, we already know his operatives snuck in there and were squirreling away records, they got caught by business insider.  It's like remember Sandy Berger, they called him Sandy burglar with stuffing documents in his pants after the Clintons missed Al Qaeda, I could see that happening.  But why did Joe Biden say that in his personal records there are transcripts of conversations he had with Vladimir Putin? Why would he say that? You don't think the president is going to turn up the heat on that and say, Joe, release the transcript, I released my transcript, mine was perfect, what about yours? So, this isn't going away anytime soon.  WILLIAMS: All right. Hey, Greg, take a listen, here's Joe Biden talking about Justice Kavanaugh.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  BIDEN: As they could come forward and say something that is that they said happened to them, they should start off with the presumption they are telling the truth, then you have to look at the circumstances and the facts. And the facts in this case do not exist. They never happened.  And there are so many inconsistencies in what has been said in this case. What I said during the Kavanaugh hearings was that she had a right to be heard, and the fact that she came forward, the presumption would be she is telling the truth unless it's proved she wasn't telling the truth.  WILLIAMS: So, Greg, does this give the Democrats cover holding to that standard that people now have heard from Tara Reade, people have vetted Tara Reade and now Joe Biden has spoken on Tara Reade?  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Yes. I'm going to take Biden at his word. I presume that she is telling the truth. Because that's exactly what he said. They haven't disproven it. They haven't disproven it. So, we have to presume she is telling the truth.  Look, Biden was doing great in that interview until he confessed. You know, first he had the total denial. I thought that was pretty good.  WILLIAMS: Yes.  GUTFELD: The denial was pretty strong, and then he says that's a complaint, you know, I don't know why all of a sudden, 27 years, this gets raised. What is this? What is this? That's interesting. I would pursue that. He also didn't bring up a lot of the corroborating, very tough word to say, corroborating evidence. Like what about the phone call into Larry King, I thought that was interested -- that was interesting, that was around the '90s.  I think what's fun is watching the pro Biden response which is almost word for word what their side would have mocked when presented in defense of Kavanaugh, so they are apoplectic over a single segment interview of their candidate.  The Kavanaugh thing why you can't compare it went for days. He was grilled by teams --  PERINO: Yes.  GUTFELD: -- of salivating lawyers. And Mika ruffles their feather with one segment, shut up, you are a bunch of hypocrites. Again, the argument will always be about consistency. Everybody has brought it up, but if you said believe all women then you got to destroy Joe Biden.  So theoretically, Joe Biden has to take Joe Biden out unless he says, hey, this whole believe-all-women thing it only suits us politically, so I'm actually not a sexual harasser, I'm just a shameless hypocrite that will ruin you politically given the opportunity.  Lastly, I've noticed an epidemic of people getting hoisted by their own petard. Petard is a box that holds a bomb.  PERINO: I love that.  GUTFELD: Juan, one, de Blasio gets busted for violating rules that he enforced and want people to narc on others. Number two, you saw the dudes that tried to frame Michael Flynn, framing themselves, and now you've got a guy who is right up there with Me Too and Kavanaugh getting Me Too-ed himself by himself. So, I find this epidemic to be extremely interesting. Look, a spider doing push-ups.  WILLIAMS: All right.  GUTFELD: Isn't that fun?  PERINO: Yes.  GUTFELD: It's Friday. It's Friday. Have fun, everybody. Come on.  WILLIAMS: Katie Pavlich, Katie, the vice president has said that a woman will be his vice-presidential choice. He has named the panel this week.  KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS HOST: Yes.  WILLIAMS: So, what happened today, the denial, the whole episode, is that going to impact who the choice is? I think, you know, right now you've got Senator Harris, Senator Klobuchar, Senator Warren, and former House Rep. Stacy Abrams from Georgia.  PAVLICH: Well, first, I think the news that came out of this interview today is not that he denied it, because that was obvious, what is he supposed to say, yes, I did it, let's move on. Of course, he was going to do that. The news is that he was finally asked about it, and the president had been asked about it multiple times before Joe Biden was asked about it.  So that's the first thing. And I would hope that the media doesn't just let it go, because there's been one interview about his response to it.  But to your question about the vice-presidential candidate, a lot of these women who are on the short-list, apparently, for this position were worse than Joe Biden when it came to what they said about Brett Kavanaugh and due process.  And I thought that the Trump campaign today, what they said in their statement about the Vice President Joe Biden's record on this issue especially when it comes to college campuses of young men all over the country in the standard that the Obama administration applied to sexual accusations on campus, Joe Biden would have been excel -- excelled and kicked out of campus by now.  And so, I think that if you take the statements that his vice-presidential candidates made as women and apply it to the record of Vice President Joe Biden, people are going to look at this and say, there's an injustice here.  On one side women who have valid claims are usually dismissed and ignored, or men are falsely accused, and in the political arena, both of those things are bad. So, I think people just feel bad about it and they want to move on.  WILLIAMS: You know, Katie, does that mean like you think this has been a setback for the hash tag Me Too movement?  PAVLICH: I think completely, because it shows the Me Too movement which we pointed out from the beginning was political. It wasn't about all women. It was about promoting Democratic women who are able to get Democrats more power in positions that they found interesting.  WILLIAMS: All right, so it's about politics. Coming up, stay-at-home protests breaking out around the country including this very tense being at Michigan State Capitol. How President Trump is reacting, that's next on The Five.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PAVLICH: Dozens of protests against lockdowns breaking out across the country again today. And what is happening in Michigan is getting a lot of attention too. Governor Gretchen Whitmer extending her state's buyers restrictions for another month. It comes after some armed protesters showed up in the state capital demanding a stay-at-home order be lifted.  President Trump tweeting the governor should make a deal with the protesters. So, Greg, as this thing drags on, some governors are taking the restrictions off, some are putting more on. Your thoughts?  GUTFELD: Well, you know, I'd like to quote my favorite philosopher Hannah Frankston who said you didn't come this far to come this far. So, it's like we are carrying this really expensive wedding cake to the ballroom and you make it already there, almost there, and then you drop it.  You don't want to drop it. We've been flattening this curve, this country is made of heroes who have been able to fight a deadly disease, and you don't want to just, you don't want to screw the whole thing up.  I think we do need an office of reasonableness. Like some guy like Norm from ""Cheers"" who listens to the complaint and says, OK, you both got a point, maybe, governor, not so much overreach. And protesters, wear your masks and social distance but maybe don't bring guns to the capital. Because that makes everybody really nervous.  That's kind of like the reasonableness we need, and I think that's Trump's role. He is like the street-level reasonable guy who should kind of like step in and go, OK, kids, we are almost there. Let's not screw up. We don't need a showdown.  PAVLICH: Don't make me turn this car around, please don't. Dana, there is a legal aspect to this, and Attorney General Bill Barr has been for a couple of weeks telling states, yes, we are taking a look whether you are overreaching or not, and it seems like they are getting to that point in certain places.  PERINO: And I -- and I think Bill Barr actually has said something even additional in the last few minutes here saying that's some -- it's time for some of these restrictions to be lifted.  Now, you know, the federal government is also putting a lot of the onus and rightfully so on the states and the governors to make decisions. And so, I think it's a little bit of a sticky wicket for the govern -- the federal government then to say, OK, it's time for this governor or that governor, you've gone too far, you've gone too far.  The governors are either in charge or they're not, and she will have to, Governor Whitmer will have to deal with the fallout for her -- of her decisions, and I do think also that the imagery makes a difference here.  You know, if you have, you are always going to see the pictures that grab the most attention will be the ones where they were maybe just a few people, but they are people doing things that you think, wow, OK, is that necessary? Like, whoa, back off. And in some ways, it makes the governor look more sympathetic.  But I do feel like across the board if you look at somebody like Jared Polis, the governor of Colorado, he is trying to make some good decisions. They are reopening in a lot of places, but they're continuing to keep the ski areas closed.  And I think if you are going to put it, make sure that the governors are in charge and you want to blame them for things that go wrong, you also have to give them some leeway.  PAVLICH: Yes. Juan, what about that? Giving the governors some leeway and letting them make their own decisions. But there are political implications going on inside the state. Governor Whitmer now is in a fight with Republicans, or saying that they are going to sue over her new restrictions that she has extended?  WILLIAMS: Well, I like Norm from ""Cheers."" I like reasonableness. I'm all for that. I think we do need reasonable people around here, because, you know, to me, it's pretty clear if you look at the public opinion on this, 80 percent, and I don't care which poll you take, A.P., Reuters, Kaiser Health, most Americans say they are fine with shelter in place.  I think it's like more than half of Republicans and Democrats say another month doesn't bother them, even people who are unemployed at the moment as a result.  But you know what, I think that people who have a different point of view have an important message to deliver and deserve to be heard. I don't like the guns and the intimidation. I don't like that at all.  But I think that they deserve to be heard and as long as the governors are trying to explain to the citizens what they are doing that they are operating in terms of the science. I think we've got to give these governors leeway to make those calls.  I think that, you know, if they are being unreasonable, let's have a discussion, let's challenge it.  PAVLICH: Yes.  WILLIAMS: But that's not what we are hearing from most Americans at this juncture. We have a vocal minority deserving to be heard, but they can't dictate public policy on that basis.  PAVLICH: Jesse, is it time for another plea to save the football season?  WATTERS: I mean, football, how about baseball? Let's go. I just don't see Gretchen as Norm. I don't see her looking into the face of a bunch of guys with guns storming the capital and saying, you know what, we are going to lock ourselves in this room and not come out until we solve the lockdown.  She just doesn't have what it takes. I do understand her concern. Michigan's top three in deaths, top seven in cases, but she has to read the room. This is an agricultural industrial automobile economy. They are people that are working with their hands. This is a blue-collar state. They need to work.  It's not like New York where they can go to the second home or work from home on the computer. Good governors know their state. She doesn't know hers.  PAVLICH: All right. We've been debating about reopening the economy. If you are a business owner or employee who wants to ask the president a question, send us a video at townhall@foxnews.com. Or log on to the Fox News Facebook or Instagram page to share your stories.  Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum will host America together returning to work, a town hall with President Trump live this Sunday at 7 p.m. Eastern.  And straight ahead on The Five, President Trump turns up the heat on China over the pandemic.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WATTERS: President Trump blasting China for botching the handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The president threatening to slap a trillion dollars' worth of tariffs on the country in retaliation.  Trump also saying he has seen evidence suggesting COVID-19 came from a lab in Wuhan. Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: We're looking at exactly where it came from, who it came from, how it happened separately, and also scientifically.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Have you seen anything at this point that gives you a high degree of confidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the origin of this virus?  TRUMP: Yes, I have. Yes, I have. And I think that the World Health Organization should be ashamed of themselves, because they are like the public relations agency for China.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: All right, Greg. So, in terms of making China pay a price, I don't know if more tariffs are the right idea when you are coming out of this terrible economy, what would you do?  GUTFELD: That was my line, the who is press agency, remember that? I like to call every line that he uses. All right. But, you know, it's a compliment to me. I'm very touched.  Look, this is always, if you've been conscious for four years, you are aware that Trump's strategy rarely produces the goal that the media expects. So, his strategy is publicly I am the bad cop, privately, I am the good cop.  So, he is blunt with China, and he's rightly so should be blunt and angry with them. But then he'll be favorable to President Xi, who I know I just ruined his name. So, the goal ends up not being war or peace. It's a situation that it's, you know, gives our country the advantage.  So, he is working on behalf of the United States, but it's his role. That's why you -- I don't understand how people go, get all, you know, you can look at the stock market, the stock market it's like your aunt. She is just having a nervous breakdown every 10 minutes. It's like, we get it, this is how Trump works.  WATTERS: Dana, it looks like the president is being successful so far with rallying the rest of the world kind of against China. What kind of momentum do you see there?  PERINO: Well, first of all, Greg, I got to point out that if the president ever takes one of your lines, you just got to give it to them free of charge. Like no, don't try to take credit. You need to give it for him.  GUTFELD: I do the same -- I do the same with Scott Adams.  PERINO: It's true. Oh, drink. I don't even have my water with me here. So the -- I thought that the President was actually trying to make a little bit of views yesterday on China and he is almost like, if you were Hansel and Gretel you're dropping -- he's dropping crumbs along the way. Because he is the commander in chief, he has to figure out a way to deal with this country because of something that China is doing, while we're all busy dealing with coronavirus, they are pushing forward in the South China Sea. Who knows what they're doing to the Uyghurs? The human rights situation in China is deteriorating. Think about what China has done to the continent of Africa.  And now basically, having taken all these minerals and put all these countries in debt, now are calling for those debts to be paid by these African countries have been treated terribly by China. I think that you have a split and the Europeans are not exactly sure how to deal with China, because in a lot of ways they think they need China's help.  We also have a situation where China actually might be the first country that comes up with a vaccine. Are we going to want access to that vaccine? Now, we know that when Remdesivir made by Gilead, when it was sent over as a possible treatment, the Chinese, what did they do? Immediately tried to copy it, and not give us any credit for it.  So we've got big problems with China. I think instead of the tariffs, like tariffs are paid by people so I wouldn't do that. But you look at something like Japan, has basically said to all of its companies, we want you to come back and manufacturer in our country. Leave China. We will help you do that. That would be a big undertaking for American companies, but I think the President could possibly do something like that. And I would call that before Joe Biden does.  WATTERS: Yes, I fully support that. Maybe in the second term, right. Maybe right now, you don't go that far as the economy recovers. Katie Pavlich, you know, the timing of --  PAVLICH: Yes, Jesse Watters.  WATTERS: -- China trying to patent that drug, very suspicious. It was like, within the same week, as the WHO said this thing wasn't contagious, yet they're trying to patent the drug.  PAVLICH: Yes. The timing on all the things that China is saying you can just erase all of what they've been telling you because it's not true. In terms of what we can do here in the United States, China is engaged in espionage against the United States on every single level. I know Tom Cotton is working to make sure that we now at least put a hold on visa, student visas for Chinese students who want to come to the United States and study STEM and be in our labs and our Ph.D. program and steal all of that information and take it back to China so they can copy drugs and they can compete with us when it comes to vaccines.  So domestically, there's a lot we can do. In Europe, you know how the U.K. -- the U.K. finally coming to their senses and dropping Huawei as a 5G provider. Hopefully, the rest of your Europe will not be cowardly and doing the same. And they will realize that the West has their interests in mind, and not China and take lessons from Africa in the way that China has come in to help them and really it's about controlling them and taking away the resources.  So, there -- as Dana said, there are huge problems with China, and they're going to take a whole of government approach in addressing them and hopefully, politics won't get in the way of that.  WATTERS: I smell the blood of an Englishman. A little Hansel and Gretel reference from Dana's earlier point with regard to Huawei in China and the U.K. Juan Williams, how do you separate the Chinese Communist Party from the Chinese people because that's the problem. We don't have any problems with the people, it's the authoritarian regime.  WILLIAMS: That's very good, Jesse. I appreciate your making that point because I think that we need to, as this become so political, make it very clear that we're talking about the regime.  WATTERS: You know what, Juan. We're going to now go to the President because he took a few questions earlier on the way to Air Force One. Let's listen to that.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  TRUMP: The Lincoln Memorial, that'll be very nice. But we'll be back soon, and I think some of you will be traveling around the area, wherever. But we'll be at Camp David for a working weekend.  (CROSSTALK)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The North Korean leader just surfaced at a fertilizer plant in North Korea. Do you know about this?  TRUMP: I'd rather not comment on it yet, Kim Jong-un. We'll have something to say about it at the appropriate time.  (CROSSTALK)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE)  TRUMP: I think he's doing a very good job. He's a great friend of mine. And the President is doing really well in Brazil. We're very proud of him.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: How about the situation of the coronavirus in Brazil?  TRUMP: Well, they have -- they've been hit hard. Brazil has been hit very hard. But you have a president that's doing a very good job.  (CROSSTALK)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you know that Kim is alive? Can you at least say that?  TRUMP: I don't want to talk about it now.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. President.  (CROSSTALK)  TRUMP: I may.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE)  TRUMP: So, we're going to see what happens. A lot of things are happening with respect to China. We're not happy obviously with what happened. This is a bad situation all over the world, 182 countries, but we'll be having a lot to say about that. It's certainly an option. It's certainly an option.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. President, are you going to be social distancing - -  TRUMP: It's certainly an option.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you going to be social distancing during your work weekend?  TRUMP: Yes, I will.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Recently you said you were not happy with Gov. Kemp about opening up in Georgia.  TRUMP: I didn't say that, John. I said I didn't like the particular place, the spa, the tattoo parlor. No, no, I think it's wonderful. I want to see us open safely, but I didn't like spas and that to parlors and I wasn't thrilled about that. But I said nothing about Georgia other than that.  I like the state's opening. They will be opening. They can open safely and quickly I hope because we have to get our country back. Thank you. Thank you.  (END VIDEOTAPE)  WATTERS: OK, that was the president united states leaving for Camp David for a working weekend and more of THE FIVE after the break.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PERINO: All right, welcome back. That's a new song by Kenny Chesney written by one of my friends J.T. Harding. Jesse, I got to tell you something. Right before you -- in this previous block, when you quoted classic children's literature. You said that Fee-fi-fo-fum is from Hansel and Gretel, a reference that's something I said. It's actually from Jack and the Beanstalk.  WATTERS: Wait, it's not. It's not. It's Jack and the Beanstalk, you know.  PERINO: There you go. There you go.  WATTERS: I stand corrected.  PERINO: All right, parents in Georgia say they're getting nervous because teens can now get their driver's licenses without taking a road test due to the coronavirus. Now Greg, you know a lot about driving tests. You went through this not too long ago. What do you think of this?  GUTFELD: Well, Jack and the Beanstalk, Hansel and Gretel, this truly is the Algonquin table, not THE FIVE. Teenagers are the perfect group for road tests. It's the -- I don't know if you've been outside lately because I come in every day, it's the autobahn out there. Because there are fewer cars, a dramatic decline in traffic, there's an uptick in fatalities caused by relentless speeding.  And the calling card of the under -- you know, the underdeveloped brain of a young driver who has nothing to lose because they can't tabulate loss at all, they have to take a driver's test. This is idiotic. Sorry.  PERINO: Juan, how would you feel if you were a parent and all of a sudden your teenage kids didn't have to have a driver's test?  WILLIAMS: I feel unsafe. I don't think it's too rational. But at the same time, due to the virus, what choice do you have? Because if you're 16, you're dying to get your driver's license. That's just reality. But I must have -- I do have a question, Dana. Where are they going? Right now, there's less traffic because there's nowhere to go. So what's the rush? If you could just say, hey, slow down on the hormones. You know, you don't need the license right now.  PERINO: You don't. Katie, how about?  WATTERS: They're leaving their parent's house.  PERINO: I bet you pass your driving tests with flying colors.  PAVLICH: It's like the concept of having your driver's license when you turn 16. You don't want to wait until you're 17 to do this. But I think Greg should ask for a refund since he had to go through all the testing and I do think that parents are actually responsible for making sure their kids know how to drive before they go to the DMV to get their driver's license.  So you know, that preparation I think can happen. You can still be a safe driver without having the exact test at the DMV. But it's a good prudent thing to have, I think.  PERINO: Jesse, I'm looking into the future, and I'm seeing you teaching your young daughters to drive. That'll be something.  WATTERS: Yes, that will be something, would it? I can just imagine, in Georgia, you have teenage adrenaline junkies probably hopped up on some crazy drug I've never heard of, and then you have COVID-19. I'm taking my chances with COVID-19.  PERINO: Well, who knows? I mean, I think that young people can also be very responsible. We want to be clear. All right, ""FAN MAIL FRIDAY"" is up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: All right ""FAN MAIL FRIDAY."" First question from Terry T. What is the one job in your past that you wouldn't mind doing again? Katie?  PAVLICH: I was a hostess at a golf course. That was really fun.  GUTFELD: That's fun. Outside all the time.  PAVLICH: Yes. It was a great job.  GUTFELD: Getting tips.  PAVLICH: Yes, outside. Well, I got in fights with waiters because I wasn't old enough to be a waiter so I had to be a hostess. And they wouldn't always share their tips even though I would bust their table, so they weren't spreading the wealth around.  GUTFELD: I could predict Dana's answer. Dana, what is one job you wouldn't mind doing again?  PERINO: Country Music DJ but with better hours because I worked overnight. And I would not want to work overnights again, but I would like -- I'd do that job again.  GUTFELD: You do it already. You do it right now on THE FIVE. This next song is from so and so written by a good friend of mine coming up.  PERINO: So good. But I have friends.  GUTFELD: Jesse?  WATTERS: I just can't believe Dana fact check my fairy tale like that.  GUTFELD: I know. Well --  WATTERS: I mean, I get one thing wrong my entire career, it's a fairy tale. I mean, I'd probably -- I was a busboy for like a week before I got fired, so I'd probably be a busboy just so I could be in a restaurant again.  GUTFELD: Eat off other people's plates. What about you, Juan?  PERINO: The fries.  WILLIAMS: My first job was as a gardener, the Brooklyn Botanical Garden, so I can imagine that. That's a lot of fun. And then at one point in school, I was a short-order cook in the cafeteria and I had a lot of fun, got some burns but I had a lot of fun doing that. That's an intense job by the way.  GUTFELD: Yes. I was -- my favorite job aside from this was being a -- called a pool monitor at Foster City, California condo on Edgewater Drive. And I remember the first question the guy asked me was do you have a life- saving certificate? And I said no. And he says, good, you won't need it.  And he says, we do not want you to save anybody because we don't have insurance. So just sit in the chair and hand the stick. Use the stick if anybody is drowning. Luckily, that never happened, Foster City, California is.  Next question, from Frenchy Firecracker, blast from the past. Real quick, if you could have unlimited access to one thing besides money, what would it be? Well, that's greedy. Dana, what would it be? You can't say money.  PERINO: Right now, at the end of this week, red wine.  GUTFELD: Yes. Juan, unlimited access to what?  WILLIAMS: Your love, Gregory.  GUTFELD: I was going to say the same thing. Jesse?  WILLIAMS: That's what I thought. I'd beat you to it. I'd beat you to it.  WATTERS: Well, there's one answer I'm not allowed to say so I'm going to go with, if it's not money -- I can't say money? Are you sure I can't say money? Wishes, do I get wishes?  GUTFELD: Yes, you get wishes.  WATTERS: Three wishes.  GUTFELD: Unlimited wishes. Katie?  WATTERS: Right.  PAVLICH: I would say land or airplane rides.  GUTFELD: That's good. That's very practical. Because if you have land, you're going to need the airplanes. I'm kind of like, Jesse, what I want to say is perhaps illegal right now. It might change in a few years where we all look back and go, why was that illegal? So I'm not going to say what it is. But if you have any, meet me after the show. I'm usually on 46th. All right, ""ONE MORE THING"" is up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WILLIAMS: It's time now for Friday fun, ""ONE MORE THING."" Dana, you're up.  PERINO: All right, I'm going to irritate Greg a little bit but I'm going to go into continue on the Country Music front. Five-time Grammy winner Steven Curtis Chapman has released a new song that hopes to inspire and lift up those who are struggling during the coronavirus. And other country stars like Brad Paisley and Lauren Alaina lent their voices to the project.  And I had a chance to speak to Steve and Lauren earlier about the importance of this song that they have just performed, Together We'll Get Through This. Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  STEVEN CURTIS CHAPMAN, SINGER: It's not the word we've heard a lot in recent months and years. And it was so refreshing and inspiring to me because it's what we're all longing for. It's what we're made for, relationship, togetherness.  LAUREN ALAINA, SINGER: I am so thankful for opportunities like being a part of this song because I think music brings us all together. I understand the importance and really believe in this song and I believe in people. And I think we're going to get through this.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: The proceeds from the song benefit the Opry Trust Fund and the Gospel Music Associations Disaster Assistance fun. They help those who have been gravely affected by the pandemic. And we thank them for being a part of our show today.  WILLIAMS: Thank you, Dana. So Dana, what do you do when you save 1,000 lives? You celebrate. Take a look. You're looking at the fanfare at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan as the staff celebrated the release of Ramdeo Radhay. He was the 1,000 patients successfully discharged after recovering from coronavirus. His wife and children who work at a nursing home also tested positive but they didn't have to be hospitalized.  Mr. Ramdeo says that he wants to thank you, everyone, at Lenox Hill a million times. I say multiply that times 999 for all the other people saved by the doctors, nurses, healthcare workers at Lenox Hill Hospital. Jesse?  WATTERS: Well, every day, Greg Gutfeld never misses an episode of THE FIVE because he sets his DVR and he goes so many watches himself. And he's in love with himself and gets very excited watching himself. We found footage of Greg watching himself. There he is on television. He thinks he's so witty with his little norm references and his stupid little spiderman push- ups. He's just very charged up every time he comes home. It's unforgettable.  Also unforgettable, ""WATTERS' WORLD"" 8:00 p.m. Eastern Saturday night. We have a ""WATTERS' WORLD"" investigation into Bill Gates. Is he a devious mastermind or are the Internet rumors false? We'll tell you the truth at 8:00.  GUTFELD: I'll save you time. They're false.  WATTERS: Not all of them.  WILLIAMS: OK, Greg. You're up.  GUTFELD: All right, ""THE GREG GUTFELD SHOW."" It's after Jesse. It's 10:00 p.m. I got Dave Rubin, amazing Emily Compagno, Kat Timpf, Tyrus also. That's tomorrow 10:00 p.m. Let's do this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Animals are great. Animals are great. Animals are great.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: We're running out of time, but I had to fit this in it. This is a self-loading laundry basket. Check it out. It's amazing. Just throw your clothes there, and it immediately goes into the laundry basket, right? There you go. Look, look, look, there you go. See? Isn't that amazing? Oh, he didn't like the sock, or did he? There you go. I could watch that for days.  WILLIAMS: All right, Katie?  PAVLICH: My one more thing is going to be pointing out Greg Gutfeld's fancy Friday tie that he has on today.  WILLIAMS: Katie, we have to -- we have to go. I apologize.  PERINO: Well done, Katie.  WILLIAMS: That's it for us this week. Stay safe everyone. See you back here on Monday.

13,FOX,"Coronavirus-related lawsuits explode amid COVID-19 crisis.  Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.  Sign up here.  I’m just going to list some lawsuits arising from the coronavirus pandemic, straight from The Washington Post. Airlines have been sued over grounded flights. Ticket brokers have been sued over canceled events. Insurers have been sued over coverage limits. Grocers and Internet retailers have been sued over rising prices. Hospitals have been sued over protective gear. Universities have been sued over closures. Amusement parks have been sued over unusable season passes. Ski resorts have been sued over refunds. Strip clubs have sued for federal benefits. DEROY MURDOCK: TRUMP TEAM'S CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE — THEY INSPIRED, MOTIVATED AND TURNED THE TIDE A church has been sued for holding services. Cruise lines have been sued for sailing with the virus. Banks have been sued for helping existing customers first. Gyms have been sued for collecting membership fees. Walmart has been sued for allegedly allowing a sick worker to infect others. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Target has been sued over the efficacy of its hand sanitizer. Hooters has been sued over allegedly stinting on severance. Ride-hailing firms have been sued over sick leave. And multiple employers have been sued for allegedly firing workers who complained about safety measures. So here's a suggestion. When the lockdown lifts, everyone should go back to work – except the lawyers. Seriously. I think this is the first time we are starting a civilization with the burden of lawyers. When the world began, you didn't need a real estate lawyer to buy a cave. The witch doctor didn’t have to get malpractice insurance. There were no recalls on the wheel. And do you think we'd even have fire if a lawyer was near? CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP So to get us out of this hole today, we need lawyers to lighten up. Congress should attach legal immunity to these bailouts, so companies and organizations don’t get ruined again – by some guy yelled ""cough"" in a crowded theater. Then when the economy returns, we can get back to suing the crap out of each other. This seems like a plan we can all get behind. Except maybe the lawyers. Which means it has to be good.

14,FOX," This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" April 29, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everybody. I am Jesse Watters, along with Dana Perino, Juan Williams, Greg Gutfeld, and Kennedy. It is 5:00 in New York City, and this is THE FIVE. The left's double standard on Joe Biden's sexual assault allegation exploding into a major controversy, top Democrats who wants led the charge against Brett Kavanaugh are either silent or downplaying a credible claim against their presumptive nominee.  The biggest hypocrisy coming from Democrats on Biden's VP shortlist, take a look what they said during the Kavanaugh confirmation.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Republicans want to confirm Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, and they are willing to step on anyone, including the victim of a vicious sexual assault in order to advance their agenda.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It comes down to credibility, to your point, you know? And it's going to be about listening to what each party has to say, but I believe her.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I believe her. She is credible. She should be heard.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: And when it came to Kavanaugh, Democrats didn't care about due process or giving him the benefit of the doubt. But now that it's Joe Biden, some of the same people are conveniently changing their tune.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She has come forward. She has spoken. And they have done an investigation in several outlets. Vice President Biden has vehemently denied these allegations, and I support Vice President Biden.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I believe that women deserve to be heard and believe that they need to be listened to. But I also believe that those allegations have to be investigated. I believe Joe Biden.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: As I said, she has a right to tell her story. On the issue of Joe, I mean, I can only speak to the Joe Biden I know. I mean, he has been a lifelong fighter in terms of stopping violence against women.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: OK, Juan Williams, I have to acknowledge you have been very fair in how we have treated this story with the Kavanaugh and Biden hypocrisy. And now that I've buttered you up, I want you to answer my question in the way that I want you to answer it, OK? So we this montage that the producers just put together was devastating. How devastating is that montage to these women's credibility?  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: You mean to the nominees, the people who might be the vice president, Jesse?  WATTERS: Yup.  WILLIAMS: Yeah. Well, I think it's pretty clear from the montage that the Democrats are in a bind here. They said that everyone deserves to be heard. Even if its 30 years later, that person deserves to be heard. That's what happened in the Kavanaugh hearing. So I think that clearly the Democrats are on the defensive here.  Now, let me say it's also true that Republicans, especially the Trump campaign, is trying to exploit this issue. So both things can be true. The other point I would make here is that I think that if you stop for a second, you can look down the road. It's pretty clear that President Trump is opening the door to a review of the 16 or 17 women who were on the record making charges of, you know, of bad misconduct against him.  And you can imagine that the same instrument that Republicans want, the media, all of the surrogates, you know, making charges. There's another side to that, and it's going to come against the president. Now, one last point, Jesse, I think that if Biden was smart, he would come out and do a big interview, hopefully on Fox News, but anywhere, and talk about this.  And he would also clear the University of Delaware to release all records. Let's just clear the air on this, because I don't think this is going to end his campaign in any way. But I think it's better for the Democrats to get this out and get it past him.  WATTERS: Hey, Kennedy, wouldn't you agree with Juan? Probably get it out now, and just -- you know, it's going to come back in the fall, obviously, you know, may be ask the University of Delaware. Release my senatorial papers. Get it all out now. And I just, you know, take your medicine.  LISA KENNEDY MONTGOMERY, FOX NEWS HOST: Absolutely. And it's one question that the Biden campaign can easily take off the table. And the way some of these female senators are treating this, the hypocrisy and the double standard, I think is incredibly offensive to victims. And what we need here clearly is one standard that doesn't have to do with politics, doesn't have to do with someone you like, and the convenience of clearing this person in order to move forward.  I think that's also very, very offensive and dangerous to victims who might not come forward, because they got caught up in this highly politicized vortex. And it ruins lives. It damages reputations, and does very little to the people who have been so harmed as victims of sexual assault, that, you know, this has come to light in the Me Too movement.  So if you really believe in that movement, they created the Kavanaugh standard. And what that means is its fair to go back decades into someone's life and hold them to account for choices they made back then. Brett Kavanaugh was a teenager. Those are the accusations they were dealing with. Joe Biden was a United States senator, and he had much greater responsibility.  And, you know, arguably, more wisdom not to -- not only not harm someone and sexually assault them, but also not retaliate, and fire that person because those advances were unwanted.  WATTERS: Yeah. And that's a good point, because this was after, allegedly, the Anita Hill situation which he was heavily involved in. Dana, allegedly, the Biden campaign, they're circulating talking points to some of their surrogates and they're pointing to this New York Times article that they say clears them. It actually doesn't clear them. It's kind of a mess.  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: No. It's a mess. And this position of Joe Biden is untenable. So they are saying -- the campaign is saying that Joe Biden denies it. But Joe Biden has not been asked to directly. I agree with Juan that he should either do an interview with a high profile person, and answer all of the questions.  However, if he chooses to have his -- yeah, Greg, definitely, if he chooses to have his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, sit with him for that interview, she cannot answer the tough questions for him by jumping in and saying let me vouch for his character. Also, if I can just say a couple of words about Kamala Harris, so the senator.  We didn't play the montage of what we could of her vicious prosecution of Brett Kavanaugh during his hearings. But when she said that I know Joe Biden's character, and he, you know, he was instrumental in the Violence Against Women Act. OK, that has nothing to do with her accusations. So you either need an independent investigation, like, from the FBI and ask for that or do an interview. Jill Biden But basically, what Joe Biden has done by not himself talking about it, and all of these other surrogates in a position of having a point to the New York Times. But what happened today, even The New York Times said that's fake news. Because The New York Times has said it was inconclusive. And if you have not read the story, then go back and listen to the Daily, The New York Times' podcast, where they interview the reporter that spent two weeks going through this.  And at the end of it, she says we don't know. And part of the thing that is a big mystery here is something that everybody has pointed out, is that there apparently is -- well, she's -- Tara Reade says that there is a complaint that she filed with the Senate. And that paper, that document should exist. How much do you want to bet that that paper disappears?  WATTERS: Yes, it has either disappeared or it is under lock and key in the office of the University of Delaware where they keep all his papers. Greg, there is no mechanism, though, to adjudicate this. This is just like these things that happened decades ago. It's just going to percolate out there in the atmosphere, and people are just going to take sides.  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Yeah, where to start? You know, to Dana's point about Kamala bringing up, you know, Joes support for that bill. Well, let's not forget that Harvey Weinstein was an amazing supporter of feminist issues, as was Bill Clinton. And there were reasons for that, because it's the progressive pig pass (ph) that allows you to get away with a lot.  I do think the #Me Too needs an adjustment. It needs #Me Too unless it's somebody running for president as a Democrat, very long hashtag. But I think they should change it. This is really delicious. I'll tell you why. There only used to be one requirement to be Joe's VP choice. It was female. Now, he has added another.  You have to be a woman, and doubt the word of a credible female victim in order to be considered the VP. So it's a great measure of how thirsty these candidates are -- the candidates for the candidacy are by how fast they will steamroll over this female alleged victim. We already knew that Gillibrand was an ambitious, you know, Tracy Flick.  But I have got to admire Abrams for just jumping in there, because it's an interesting choice that you have to make in your head. Do I sign the oath that I believe in Joe and go nowhere? Or I don't believe in Joe and go nowhere, or if I sign that oath, I could become the next president. Because Abrams is saying screw Tracy Reade, I get the VP nod, Joe wins.  I'm VP, then he is removed from wandering nude in the Rose Garden, and then I am president. So she is very, very smart. I think she's very smart. This is the strangest time for an election in history. You got Trump defending his crown. You got a pandemic, which will wilfully destroy an economy. But it's the first time the Democrats are desperate to replace, you know, to replace their nominee with anything that has a pulse.  And I think that, like, sometimes I wonder why are we helping the Democrats with this? Why are we helping them unload this guy, because anything is better than Joe Biden? You saw him yesterday with Hillary. The guy didn't - - like, the guy almost fell asleep during it. And he also -- he has got to be worried. Alyssa Milano, his most famous ally, tweeted support for Tara Reade.  I mean, that's like, oh, boy. That's not good for him. Because that was his one in the bag that he had, and say, hey, look, she is for me, not so much anymore.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: We will be watching Tara Reade on the Greg Gutfeld Show this weekend. I'm sure that will be her first venue that she visits.  GUTFELD: Are you mocking me? You are mocking me.  WATTERS: No, not at all, no, no. President Trump blasts Democrats, claiming they're taking a vacation as millions of Americans suffer.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PERINO: President Trump pressuring Democrats to return to Washington to help millions of suffering Americans, House Democrats say a Congressional physician warned it could be dangerous to return to work. But President Trump has a different theory.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: Well, Democrats, they don't want to come back. They don't want to come back. I think they should be back here, but they don't. They are enjoying their vacation. And they should not be because of Nancy Pelosi eating ice cream on late-night television.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: So Kennedy, it's -- I think, you know, pretty safe ground to make fun of Democrats for not wanting to come back, because a lot of people think that Congress does not do anything anyway, so there's that. But what about this point that the Democrats say that their doctor told them that it would not be a good idea? I mean, how do they weigh that?  KENNEDY: They socially distance. They wear face masks. They wash their hands, and they don't touch their face. And come back and they do critical work, because their work decides who lives and dies right now. And that is the unfortunate reality. You know, it's very easy for them to stay in quarantine in, you know, for the most part by and large their gilded towers, and expect people to work in nursing homes and hospitals and fire and police stations, and Chipotle.  Kentucky Congressman, Thomas Massie, has been very entertaining on this. He wants to get back to work. He is challenging people to get back to work. House Democrats say they don't have any legislation, so why should they hurry back to craft legislation? And at least do something to make the situation better and make your constituents feel like you care about them.  PERINO: Well, Juan, one of the things that they could do is Senators Portman and Durbin, in a bipartisan way, have proposed a way for the senators and the Congress to be able to vote, you know, by proxy or, you know, from afar. And there is so much resistance to that. I mean, doesn't it seem like there is a technological solution here?  WILLIAMS: I think there is. I mean, it's pretty clear what you just laid out, Dana. That's exactly right. But, you know, there is a lot of tradition about people showing up in person in the Congress to do the work. You know, what we are talking about, though, is 4.8 shrinkage in terms of GDP, Gross Domestic Product, over the next -- the last quarter. That's terrible.  And I don't think you can blame Republicans or Democrats. And I sure don't think anybody can do anything but blame the virus. Let's just be clear. And when it comes to the Congress and the president's nasty little comment about ice cream and they're enjoying their vacation. I don't understand, because Democrats, in fact with Republicans, have passed four large bills.  Two of them with huge spending intended to deal with this issue. And the Democrats worked very hard to the point that some Republicans said, oh, you're slowing it down by making these demands, and these demands aren't directly related. But the Democrats are working to get in money for hospitals, for people who are poor and hungry in this country.  PERINO: Right.  WILLIAMS: I think that you can -- even if you are a hard-liner, make a case for them self. I don't think that's a fair argument. And I think that I would agree with Kennedy on people coming back. I think that if you can get one or two staffers in there, go to work.  PERINO: And Greg, they already know that they are going to have to do more going forward. And members of Congress need to be there. I mean, they haven't had any committee meanings. They can't do any of the work, even if they wanted to do oversight, they couldn't do that, so your thoughts.  GUTFELD: God, this is hard, because I don't want them to work, you know? Because I just don't want to them to work. However, you know, the Founding Fathers assumed, because you know that I am an expert on the Founding Fathers, that people had to be present in the Capitol to work. But there are a few things that have happened since then.  There are these things called computers, and you can get on the internet, and you can do stuff from afar. I just ordered, like, $100 worth of records. I think, you know, these guys -- and they're old and they're fat and they're unhealthy, stay home and work from home, and you can pass all this money from there.  I think it's time that we change these traditions to reflect the reality that there is. And I agree with Juan, you know, the economy is 4.8 percent? The argument that this is an evil capitalist, which is often society propagated on our American campuses by professors who read nothing but Noam Chomsky and Howard Zinn, they claim that this is an evil, greedy society.  How is it that this evil, greedy society sacrificing its economy to save the most vulnerable people? I mean, even Sweden, you know, the model of cool socialism, didn't even do that. But here, fat cat America is doing something so incredible. It's so incredible. And we tend to forget. And I think we need to remind ourselves of that, maybe.  PERINO: Jesse, do you think that these members of Congress need to get back to town?  WATTERS: Yeah, I do. Do you remember during the shutdown when Nancy tried to leave the country on a jet, and the president grounded the jet?  PERINO: Yeah.  WATTERS: I think this time he should send the jet to Nancy, stock it full of ice cream, and say in five we are going wheels up, Nance, and I'm going to give you a lift back to D.C. I mean, she is like the most powerful woman in the world and she is sitting, hiding in her mansion. You can't say the president is not leading and then hide in your mansion.  It's not a good look, especially when the Senate is coming back to work. She is basically acknowledging she is not an essential employee. And most of the time, Congressman Arndt, but now they are. She could go back into China. She could do infrastructure. She could do testing. She could create tons of legislation. So it would be a symbolic move to show the Congress working again.  They should be on the frontlines along everybody else. I just hope Nancy doesn't want to stay at home because she doesn't want to help the recovery or visually associate herself with the federal government response. But I'm going to give her the benefit of the doubt.  PERINO: I'm sure you hope that. I'm sure you do. All right, coming up next, disturbing videos shows how out of control the homeless crisis is in the epicenter of the outbreak.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WILLIAMS: Welcome back. Shocking images of the homelessness crisis getting far worse in the biggest COVID-19 hotspot in the country, New York City leaders facing criticism as homeless people crowd the subway and create unsanitary conditions. Scenes like this one that you are seeing, putting first responders and essential workers who ride mass transit at risk. The state's Governor, Andrew Cuomo, disturbed by what is happening. Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): The picture of a subway car filled with homeless people and their belongings. Respect the essential workers. That is disgusting what is happening on those subway cars. It's disrespectful for the essential workers who need to ride the subway system.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: So, Dana, there's no doubt about it. Essential workers do come to work off and on the subway. At the same time, the homeless population is, you know, they are very vulnerable, high risk in terms of underlying conditions. Is there an empathy element that we have to consider as we look for solutions?  PERINO: There absolutely is an empathy element. But there's also a time for actually doing something. You know, we have been talking about the homeless crisis across America, but especially in some of these bigger cities like Los Angeles and New York, San Francisco, Seattle, where you have just a tremendous number of people who are out of sorts.  You know, they have a loved one somewhere. Maybe they are lost. Maybe they don't have -- maybe they lost track of their family. Maybe they have drug addiction problems or mental health problems. There's a ton of empathy to be had, but there's also a time for action. And so when these homeless people are on the street, then the governor doesn't have to necessarily say something like he had to say, which is -- and he is right.  I mean, essential workers that have to utilize the subway to get back and forth to work in order to help us be able to live our lives. Yes, absolutely something that should've been done. Something should've been done along time ago about the homeless. And we need maybe to figure out a way to put a group in charge that is going to actually finally try to deal with homelessness, rather than trying to sweep it under the rug.  WILLIAMS: That is great. And, you know -- and Greg, I was thinking, you know, you live in New York. And right now, there is a lot of argument from people that say New York is different than the rest of the country when it comes to this virus, far more of a hotspot. Do you think part of this is people just picking on New York or delighting in New York's problems?  GUTFELD: No, not at all. I think that the subways do play a role in transmission. We just have people on top of people. I think the opposite of empathy is letting sick people be sick in public. And I hate it when any time you try to seek a solution, people say you are being insensitive. This is why the mayor, Mayor De Blasio is a disgrace.  Because I think he does not mind that the homeless have gone underground, because they are less visible. And this is one reason why we need people to get back to work and start using the public spaces because then you can't get away with this.  Let's remind everybody that while the mentally ill and the homeless have created dangerous campsites in our public areas, what was the mayor doing? He was harassing the law-abiding public, trying to get them to narc on each other and then threatening to send the police after Jewish folks who were practicing their religion. I mean, that's really not a good look.  And meanwhile, there's his wife who coincidentally -- wasn't she in charge of an $800 million program that was intent on helping the mentally ill who are often on the streets? I wonder if there was any oversight by the mayor on that -- on that group.  And then this is what's interesting. There's something else you don't hear about the homeless, the homeless. Like what is the percentage of death because of those underlying conditions during this pandemic? What about the untreated mental illness? What about the substance abuse problems now combined with COVID? Have you heard anything? I'm serious. Have you heard anything about who's dying, who ended up being buried on that island, right in New York City because their bodies weren't claimed? Who could that be? Does anybody care?  WILLIAMS: That was a sad picture itself.  GUTFELD: Yes. Did you hear De Blasio say a thing? You know, that's all I'm saying?  WILLIAMS: I think like -- well, Jesse, if you were Mayor Watters or Governor Watters, as a frequent -- a man who I know was frequently on the subway, what would you do? What would you do, Mayor?  WATTERS: Well, first, I'd ask you for money, Juan, because I got to run the campaign on something. And then I would do this. Technically, the governor controls the subways. The MTA is controlled by the governor, but the enforcement is done primarily by the mayor, because the NYPD is controlled by the mayor and the NYPD has to go in there and clean it up.  And the NYPD has been going in there. There have been 60,000 engagements with homeless people on the subways within the last, you know, month or so. And only 3,000 of those instances did the homeless people accept the help, say, OK, I'll go to the shelter, I'll get a roof over my head and a hot meal. They refuse the help they're given.  So you're offering more help to the homeless who I feel bad for and less help to the people that actually have to use the subways to perform their duties on the frontline. So I have no confidence in the mayor to handle this at all. And unfortunately, you're not going to get the city humming unless you get the homeless epidemic taken care of before you deal with the pandemic.  WILLIAMS: Kennedy, you just heard Mayor Watters' ideas, but Mayor de Blasio says his idea is close the subway between midnight and five and have authorities clear it out. What do you think of that idea?  KENNEDY: I enjoy the feud between Mayor de Blasio and Governor Cuomo. I think it's great because I think -- I think De Blasio is completely incompetent. I'm really glad that Greg pointed out the fact that he was singling out Jews and threatening to round them up using police.  That's -- those are the authoritarian tactics that he is resorting to. And every time he makes another misstep, it makes Cuomo look better. So you know, the city is being run dangerously by an incompetent person who lacks empathy and hides behind his wife in so many instances and ends up harming more people.  We're about to enter another quarter of contraction, and the more the economy contracts, the more homeless people you're going to see. So the fact that it's gotten to this point -- it's going to get so much worse and this mayor is being chauffeured around the city. He was cornered in Central Park as a total hypocrite. And people's lives are at stake. And it just goes to show he sees homeless people as completely disposable and he really doesn't care about them.  WILLIAMS: Well, I just want to say, Kennedy, vote Watters next time. Vote Watters. Ahead, don't miss Greg's monologue on a -- on a key thing that could help America reopen all the fast food.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: So today, I'm just going to list some lawsuits arising from this pandemic but it's straight from the Washington Post. Airlines have been sued over grounded flights, ticket brokers have been sued over canceled events, insurer sued over coverage limits, grocers and internet retailer sued over rising prices, hospital sued over protective gear, university sued over closures, amusement park sued over unusable season passes.  Ski resorts have been sued over refunds, strip clubs, strip clubs have sued for federal benefits. A church has been sued for holding services, cruise lines sued for sailing with the virus. Banks have been sued for helping existing customers first, gym sued for collecting membership fees. Walmart has been sued for allegedly allowing a sick worker to infect others. Target sued over the efficacy of its hand sanitizer. Hooters has been sued over allegedly stinting on severance. I have no idea who she is. Ride-hailing firms sued over sick leave. And multiple employers have been sued for allegedly firing workers who complain about safety measures.  So here's a suggestion. When the lockdown lifts, everyone goes back to work, except the lawyers. Seriously, I think this is the first time we are starting a civilization with the burden of lawyers. When the world began, you didn't need a real estate lawyer to buy a cave. The witch doctor didn't have to get malpractice insurance. There were no recalls on the wheel.  And do you think we'd even have fire if a lawyer was present? So to get us out of this hole today, to restart civilization, we need lawyers to lighten up. Congress should attach legal immunity to these bailouts so companies and organizations don't get ruined again, you know, by some guy who yelled cough in a crowded restaurant. Then when the economy returns, we can get back to suing the crap out of each other.  This seems like a plan that we could all get behind, except maybe the lawyers which means it's got to be good.  You know, Dana, I often -- you know, I know that we need lawyers. It keeps things civil so we don't go, you know, duel with muskets. But how can we expect businesses and organizations to take the risks in opening if somebody could pull like the modern, you know, slip and fall saying that they got sick at your Arby's?  PERINO: Yes, and imagine that some of the rescue money that was just passed by the Congress has to go to actually pay for lawsuits like this, not to keep people on the payroll, which was the original intent. So I think this goes back, maybe not to the caveman days, but whenever there is a crisis, the trial lawyers start chasing the ambulances. This happens all the time.  And the Republicans for years have been trying to get tort reform passed in Congress. They have a strong support with the Democratic Party, but I think that this is the time when you're going to need compromise. Senator Mitch McConnell this week has been talking about the need for this. And he said that the next round of support money for the -- for America will not pass if there is not some sort of liability protection.  And he's not saying that because he wants to stick it to the lawyers necessarily. He's saying it because it is essential in order to get the economy moving again. If companies are too afraid to start back to work, they're worried about getting sued, we're not going to be able to do this properly.  Now, they have to figure out a way to do it so that companies still do what needs to be done in order to protect workers and all of us like whatever it's going to be in terms of keeping things clean, etcetera. But this legislation is going to pass and it's going to have liability reform. And I think there's finally time that we're actually going to get a compromise on this in Washington.  GUTFELD: So Juan, I'm not talking about allowing restaurants or any businesses to be incredibly careless. There's common sense. But I feel like there needs to be an injection of reasonableness of knowing that like, it's going to take some time to get our legs back in this economy.  WILLIAMS: That's absolutely right. I agree 100 percent. The only caveat I throw in, Greg, is I think you can't excuse count companies who say that workers come back to work, but they'd been reckless or negligent in terms of protecting those workers so that people don't get hurt, don't get sick. Those companies should be held accountable. I don't think there's any question about it.  But in terms of just being reasonable, forget slip and fall. We just have to be reasonable with each other because we're going through a difficult time.  GUTFELD: Yes, exactly. I think that there needs to be like an office of reasonableness, Jesse, which could be -- you could actually run it and just say, hey, look, lighten up everybody. I kind of admire the strip club applying for federal benefits.  WATTERS: Yes. You know, Juan is always talking about all these people that are, you know, getting the applications through to apply for these loans. They're the ones applying for the loans. Like the Lakers applied for a small business loan, and he blames Trump. How about you blame the Lakers.  But here's the deal. The Democratic Party is in the pocket of the trial lawyers. Every year, trial lawyers donate over $100 million. 75 percent of it goes to Democrats. They take their profits from suing companies, plowed back into the Democrats' coffers. The Democrats get reelected and they don't pass tort reform. That's the little shell game they play.  But the Democratic Party's economic philosophy is not what we need right now. Remember, their philosophy is overburden and over-regulate small business and kind of downplay consumerism. Remember, you know, you don't need this extra car. Why are you getting a truck? Don't take a vacation. How much do you really, really need. And then they're making small businesses go out of business.  They're suing them. They're accusing them of discrimination. They're making them compromise their religious integrity. That has to stop. And now it's going to be set up where the left is hurting the recovery and Donald Trump is going to be saying, hey, let's unleash this thing. And it's not a good position to be in if you're a Democrat.  GUTFELD: Yes. Kennedy, I'm thinking about suing you for no particular reason.  KENNEDY: Solid, all right, I'll countersue you. How do you like them apples? It boils down to something that is very unsexy, but very much needed right now, and that's personal responsibility, and that is a two-way street. And that means you can't just go around blaming everyone else for everything especially when you can't prove your grievance.  So if you're immunocompromised, and if you're older, don't go outside, don't go back to work. And if you're an employer, don't put your employees in a situation where they could become infected. We all have to help each other out. And that doesn't mean we run behind the courts as some sort of a shield when our actions, our intellect, and our rationality could have helped us out in the first place.  GUTFELD: Excellent point, personal responsibility. All right, straight ahead, is this the new normal? Well, you can see this the next time you go out to eat. A man with a tattoo?  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  KENNEDY: No can do. COVID-19 dividing people literally behind Plexiglas. Check out this restaurant in Italy testing it out. Patrons there are eating out like they're making a bank deposit. And here in America, some restaurants creating private dining spaces. It may sound extreme, but this could be the new normal.  There's also serious consideration about bringing back the dreaded office cubicle instead of those open floor plans which are really kind of annoying. So Greg, I will go to you first. We're seeing things about Plexiglas and division. What of these solutions will stick and become long term?  GUTFELD: I think -- I think it'd be more about spacing and we'll mention my good buddy Al Fresco that we will be hopefully opening up the fronts of restaurants on the sidewalk so we can spread out tables. But if you look at all the things that are being impacted, whether it is work or eating out or events, they all share one thing in common and that is gathering.  We're naturally social human beings. And all of these things, even though we think work is about work, it really is about kind of coming together the desire to be social. And if you remove the social from social events, then really what's the point? I go to restaurants never for the food. I just like to you know, I like to observe the curiosities and be part of the world. I'm a worldly person.  Don't you understand? I mean, like humans are naturally social and at certain point, we're going to have to absorb a little bit of risk. Not a lot, but a little, space, masks.  KENNEDY: All right, so Dana, what of our current COVID-19 procedures do you actually like? Well, first of all, I don't believe that Greg goes to look at curiosities. I think he goes for the pinot noir. And secondly, I would say that I am not a fan of the open plan. I believe that people should have cubicles so that they can have some privacy.  KENNEDY: Agreed. And I also like no hugging, no handshaking. I'm fine with that. Juan, very quickly, when are we going to get back to baseball? The Yankees obviously superior to the Mets. I know both of us want to see our respective teams. But will we ever see that again?  WILLIAMS: What? All right. Hey, stop it. No, no insulting. But just on the point, Kennedy. I just saw a poll today at Washington Post that said 66 percent of Americans think the current restrictions are great. In fact, a large percentage think we're going too quickly. So, I just think that people have to understand that there are real fears still and consumers who would go back in the restaurants, back to the ballgame, may not be going as quickly even if things are reopened.  GUTFELD: But Juan, the 66 percent could be the people that haven't lost their jobs. Like if you look at the -- you know, there's 25 million people. So it's hard -- and also they never in that survey, they never say what they mean by the restrictions. Is it -- is it the social distancing, which I could do forever, you know, but like staying at home and not going to work. That's -- I don't know.  KENNEDY: Yes. Netflix and (INAUDIBLE) Jesse, is that -- is that going to be our normal forever?  WATTERS: Well, I'm a fan of fine dining and some people say that I have the most refined palate of anybody at Fox News, so I am really looking forward to getting back to eating out.  PERINO: 66 of people say that.  KENNEDY: And you know what, I have faith we're all going to be bubble wrapped and divided by Plexiglas and eating snails very soon. ""ONE MORE THING"" is up next. Stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WATTERS: It's time now for ""ONE MORE THING."" All right, I'm going to issue a challenge to Dana Perino. All right, so I expect Dana to train Jasper to balance a beer bottle on his head for that long and we expect a video tomorrow. All right, let's see what we get. Juan Williams.  PERINO: He's got a little -- he's got a little thing on his head. It won't work.  WATTERS: We'll see. Excuses, excuses.  WILLIAMS: Well, you guys --  WATTERS: Go ahead, Juan.  WILLIAMS: OK. So you guys have heard about Barbie and Batman. Well, how about these new superheroes? Take a look at hashtag thank you heroes line of action figures. They're essential workers who are risking their own safety to help others during the pandemic, doctors, nurses, EMT. Proceeds from the sale of the toys by Mattel will go to charities for health care workers and first responders. Real-life heroes in action.  WATTERS: That's a good way to spend some money. Greg?  GUTFELD: I'm the real hero here, because I had this. Greg's Fox News. Oh, we got some major Fox News. I had no idea that fox is actually giggle. Listen to this Fox being tickled.  WATTERS: Sounds like a seagull.  GUTFELD: I don't know what that is but I can watch it for days. All right, that's it.  WATTERS: Dana?  PERINO: All right. So this guy in Colorado. He went two $1 million Powerball jackpot last month and won. And look at this. He claimed his tickets on Monday. He says his boss, the wife, has a lot of plans for it. That was in Pueblo, Colorado where I went to college.  GUTFELD: Wow.  WATTERS: All right, set your DVRs, everybody. Never miss an episode of THE FIVE. ""SPECIAL REPORT"" is up next with Bret.

15,FOX," This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" April 28, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Hi. I'm Greg Gutfeld, with Jesse Watters, Juan Williams, Dana Perino, and Emily Compagno, THE FIVE. In today's New York Post, a New York City E.R. doctor calls the Coronavirus the worst healthcare disaster he has ever seen. Yet, he says it's time to open up. His reasons, first, he believes the wave has crested, which is good news.  His second point, out of fear, people are avoiding hospitals for treatment of other stuff. E.R.'s have seen a big drop-off. People have cancelled tests, 911 calls have declined. If people are avoiding hospitals, how many others have died of heart attacks or strokes? The fact that we can talk about this now is actually a good thing.  At the start of this, we were ready to lock down and throw away the key. But remember, this debate will be forever. It's the prism of two ideas. Was it the distancing and shutdown that worked, or was the disease not as bad as we thought? It might be both, or maybe we flattened the curve and affected the crest of the wave.  This is where math is your buddy. Disease can have a -- disease A can have a lower kill rate then disease B, and still kill more people if it infects vastly more people. Meaning, 1 percent of 100 is 1, but a half percent of 1,000 is 50. Dana, check my numbers so I know this is right. The fact is we have already had 58,000 dead.  And if it keeps going like this over time, you can get pretty close to the predictions, a disease many times worse than the flu on top of the flu. But maybe it is time for people, meaning the young and the healthy, to return to work so we can afford to protect the elderly and the infirmed. And most important, people need to go back to the job.  And be careful and see their doctors for their usual heart, liver, and lung ailments. If they don't, the Coronavirus will kill many more people without even trying. You know, Juan, the author Daniel Murphy was chairman of the Department of Emergency Medicine at Saint Barnabas in the Bronx, so he is on the frontlines. He has seen it all.  And yet, he was emphatically saying we have to rapidly get back to work. So, I mean, that's hard to ignore, right?  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Yeah. I mean, I thought the information he presented, especially about people who were suffering strokes, heart attacks, and then not going to the hospital because they were afraid. That's very real, because that doesn't stop. You know, you got to take that into account. But I must say. I wanted to underline something you said about, you know, you presented it as the prism of two ideas.  But I think if distancing, in fact, has helped lower what we have seen in terms, not only infection, but therefore deaths, so it's like two interlocking ideas, as I was listening to you. And I think you have got to realize. I think as of today, we have a million people in this country who have tested positive for Coronavirus.  But that's, Greg, only with about -- I think it's 1.6 percent of the nation having been tested. So we, in order to really protect ourselves, we need to have more robust testing that would allow us to identify hotspots, to engage in contact-tracing, to try to halt widespread, you know, sort of exponential spread of this disease.  Dr. Fauci said in an interview, I think it was yesterday, this disease is not going away with the summer weather. He thinks it may stick around. And he thinks only by being cautious are we protecting ourselves from even a more devastating outbreak.  GUTFELD: Yeah. You know, Dana, when I was talking about the prism of two ideas, I was talking about the mistakes people make when they're looking at this, the fact that it's either this or it's this when it's actually a combination. I think there are going to be people, this might be a safe prediction who will say, see, I told you this was no big deal after they see -- after they choose to ignore the fact that our social distancing helped flatten the curve.  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Right. And then actually, they could even go back the other way, too. It's -- you are going to see a lot of -- we -- and you are right. We could debate it forever, or we could also celebrate the fact that Americans did what we were asked, right? We were able to prevent the hospitals from being overwhelmed. And Governor Cuomo said that today.  He said the hospitals did not get overwhelmed. And I think that people are mistaking something, like, when you say you want to reopen America, that's not a synonym for ignoring the virus.  GUTFELD: Right.  PERINO: OK? So you can reopen America, recognizing that we have accomplished something that the government asked of us, which was a huge sacrifice, not just the stay at home part, but the people who have lost their jobs, their businesses, all the supply chains. Like, that's a huge sacrifice. We did that. The hospitals did not get overwhelmed.  And so, people -- if you trust people, they can be responsible to try to get back and do the things that we need to do in order to keep our economy going so we can take care of all the people. Because in that New York Post piece, Greg, the doctor also said he was very worried about the people in the neighborhood.  GUTFELD: Right.  PERINO: The people who were standing in food lines for the first time, the poverty that is being basically imposed on them. So there are all of these concerns. So when you say you want to reopen America, it also -- it's not just because you think want to help President Trump win the election. That is a huge problem, and people should not fall into that.  GUTFELD: Yeah. Jesse, I would like to read a quote from the doctor and get your response. Would you like to play along with me?  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Please do.  GUTFELD: Do you have the quote, producer? Put it up there. I've worked the Coronavirus frontline, and I say it's time to start opening up. Standing up to this virus can't be the job of essential workers only. We have been strong, but we are tired. And we need the rest of you to help us by getting back to work. So essentially, what I get him saying is that we should be sharing the risk.  It is time, especially if you are young and healthy, to get out there and perhaps become part of the herd immunity that he mentions.  WATTERS: Well, you have made this point before, is that this country kind of has a pain threshold. I feel like we are reaching that pain threshold, especially in certain parts of the country. You know, going back to last conversation, any intelligent person can make an argument that proves they were right, even though they were wrong.  GUTFELD: Right.  WATTERS: I mean, I do that all the time. I mean, it's what people do. Like, you can play the Super Bowl, and then the next day you can have all of these analysts on ESPN. They should run the ball. Why did they throw the ball? They should just ground and pound. Control the clock. Anybody can do that and look good. But you talk about the prism of two ideas.  I think what we are seeing is the prism of 50 ideas. Because there are 50 governors in 50 states doing 50 different things. It's dynamic, flexible, and tailored. It's brilliant. And there are even mayors doing things different than governors with the governor's full consent. We are talking about restaurants, parks, elective surgeries.  They are all being done differently based on the local county or states' health or economic landscape. And the one-size-fits-all policy would have been a catastrophe. Could you imagine treating New York like you treat Arkansas, or treating Arkansas like you treat New York? Like, that's what Obama wanted to do, this big national central policy.  You would've heard talks of secession if that had happened. And also why it's so brilliant that they did this is because you are going be able to see in real time what's working and what's not. If you see a hotspot in a certain state, maybe they opened the gyms too early, right? You can see the mistakes being made in real-time. There's going to so much fresh data to chew on, that Dr. Birx's silk scarf is going to pop off of her neck.  GUTFELD: That's quite a visual, Jesse. Emily, what are your thoughts?  EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, just to echo these op-eds, I think just like all of America helped flatten the curve. Now, it is up to us to help Americans get back to work and thrive. And that's why it's so crucial for state and local government leaders to send messages with their decision-making right now that they are prioritizing saving jobs, while acknowledging that it's a different normal that we are going back to.  So Jesse mentioned restaurants. And the reason that I have been continuing to talk about the restaurant industry is not only because of its volume, right? It's a $900 billion industry as of last year, but also because it touches so many other industries, like manufacturing and shipping and Ag, and it has such a broad supply chain that touches millions of America.  And so we can't just flip a switch and have these businesses go back to normal, where all of a sudden think that they have the ability to get back on their feet. And I want to take LA for example, that a lot of times we bash on this show. But right now, it's a really interesting case study, because the local government there, from the beginning, has been resisting and sending headwinds to the restaurant industry as they are trying to cope with this and implement new policies.  But the mayor there, Mayor Garcetti, has been open to big, bold ideas. So for this time, I think it is incumbent upon all of us to support the creation of new policy, right, that acknowledges this that saves jobs, things like tip credits, and suspend those policies that are in existence right now that are hampstering (ph) these businesses from staying open, like certain class action litigation and things like that.  In that example, in LA, the city and local government has been resisting because they are failing to see the forest for the trees, that it's a new normal. And things like retailing alcohol, things that have been put in place during this time, we need to consider moving forward that -- with his web that faces millions of Americans.  We should look at all of these individual junctures and try to acknowledge the gives and carry these policies moving forward, because it's about saving these jobs so that we don't have an economic death, too.  GUTFELD: Yeah. And also, alfresco, that is the solution right now. Move everything outdoors as the weather gets better. Put the -- close some of the streets down. Let the restaurants put their tables outside. All right, coming up next, the media tries to pin the COVID-19 death toll on Donald Trump. Stay with us on THE FIVE.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WATTERS: The liberal media's scorn for the president is on full display. Trump's been feuding with hostile reporters during the task force briefings, and for good reason. Check out this ridiculous gotcha question.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If an American president loses more Americans over the course of six weeks than died in the entirety of the Vietnam War, does he deserve to be re-elected?  DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: So, yeah, we have lost a lot of people. But if you look at what original projections were, 2.2 million. We are probably heading to 60,000, 70,000. It's far too many. One person is too many for this.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: Plus, The View has a new target, Dr. Deborah Birx, the liberal host attacking the medical expert for defending Trump.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I feel like at this point, she is less of a doctor and more like an elderly care nurse to this guy.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So do you think that Dr. Birx is part of the problem?  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I do. I do think she is part of the problem. And it gives me no pleasure to say that. You can't be complicit in a time like this, Dr. Birx. And so I think she has become part of the problem.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: Wow. All right, well, I don't think -- I'm not even going to address The View ladies. I thought that was way, way over the top. Dana, you know, I have asked my fair number of gotcha questions before. I know how you play the game. That woman played it pretty well with the president. I just don't know if I could ever bring myself to ask a gotcha question like that to the president of the United States. Have you ever seen anything like that before?  PERINO: Do you think I have -- have I ever seen anything like that before? So I worked for a president during a time of war, torture, memos, I mean, yeah. I have seen it before. And a little bit of that is just that you get into a chance where you have the cameras on. You know, she is a reporter that has written some pretty great things. She has broken a lot of stories.  She is also writing a book about the 2020 election. So I think her question about does a president like you deserve to be re-elected was sort of geared towards where she is thinking and where she is spending her time. But remember, look, the president answered it so well. So sometimes, it doesn't matter if the question is hostile. If you hit a home run, then who cares?  It actually makes you look better. Can I speak to the Dr. Birx thing for a second? Way to stand up for women, ladies, I mean, wow. OK, Joy Behar, first of all, she's trying to look like Dr. Birx with the scarf. It's a look that I can't pull off, though I would try at some point. But here is a woman whose responsibility is not to coddle anybody.  She is supposed to try to manage a pandemic. And she is doing that with the commander in chief. So why don't we just let her do her job for as long as she needs to do it, and to do it to the best of her ability, and do it professionally, which is what she has been doing.  WATTERS: Yeah. She has been doing a very good job. Greg, I'm going to play some sound of another exchange, again, just crazy, crazy commentary from the Press Corps. The president and Dr. Birx were asked something. And you can react to all of it. Roll that.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: Are you going to apologize?  (CROSSTALK)  TRUMP: Go ahead. That's why nobody knows who you are, including me. Go ahead.  (CROSSTALK)  TRUMP: You're not getting your facts right.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have facts.  TRUMP: Well, your facts are wrong.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: Yeah. Greg, he asked a question and said, you know, we are behind South Korea. Actually no, we are ahead of South Korea. I mean, these are the kind of things that happen a lot.  GUTFELD: Well, this is the environment. It's the gotcha question game show. But I want to tie what Olivia Nuzzi and the Birx thing have in common. So Nuzzi's question is the perfect example of media narcissism. The question by its very nature is guaranteeing attention back to the person asking the question. I'm sure she got DM's (ph) from Acosta and the bald guy, saying, wow, that was really amazing what you did to her.  But the question itself is absurd. Do you deserve to be re-elected? Well, that's what the election will determine, you moron. And you can put it like -- let's put it this way. Given the tornado hit your town and killed 30 people, do you deserve to be dogcatcher? That's exactly how stupid her question was. Now, when you focus on Brix (ph), OK? It's called the contamination effect.  The media loves to just soil her reputation, because by -- if you are hanging around somebody we hate, Trump, then you are contaminated, right? They transfer the hate to her. So what about the people that Birx knows, right? Are they contaminated by now knowing her? You see how this thing works? They should do trace -- whatever they call it, contact tracing on everybody's friendships.  So lastly, why do these things have something in common? The media is hypocritically evil. They think that when they interview unsavory people, they are imparting their good moral fiber on them. So when they question Trump, they are actually the moral high ground, which is why Nuzzi had her absurd question. But when you, like Birx is among Trump, then you are the recipient of the unsavory-ness of Trump, right?  Then you are now immoral by being around him. So you see the trick. The media gets to decide who gets to impart moral value. And it's always them, but it's never you.  WATTERS: That's a good point. Juan, what do you think?  WILLIAMS: I think the press is supposed to hold powerful people accountable and ask questions. Now, I think President Trump is never shy, never shy about saying, hey, that's a crazy question, or that an unfair question, or that's a fake news question. But in this instance, he didn't do that. He treated it seriously. And as Dana pointed out, he gave what I think was a pretty good answer from his perspective.  He said the numbers are less than what had been projected, and then tried to take credit for it, so that's what he did. And by the way, I don't think it's a -- it was a gotcha question. I think it's a real question. I think they are real questions to come like today about, you know, banks and even some of the borrowers upset about the SBA screw up with the computers.  People can't get the loans. People are upset about, you know, these big companies, you know, some of these auto companies, the LA Lakers getting loans and not small business. People have legitimate questions to ask. And I don't think it's illegitimate for the president to ask them. When there's gotcha questions like who is the leader of Uzbekistan or something, Dana would know about that kind of silly question. OK, that's a gotcha question.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Does Dana know?  WILLIAMS: To me, legitimate questions --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: I do not know the leader of Uzbekistan.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: All right, Emily.  COMPAGNO: Well, I think this sort of -- it underscores the hypocrisy. Because, you know, respectfully, Juan, if her question was truly designed to provoke conversation, then why when she was called out that her question was just designed to provoke. She responded, quote, ""Shut the F up."" And I think for Joy Behar, that's just another example of someone who uses, you know, the media platform to attack those who attack women.  And she is a Hillary champion. And she calls herself a feminist. And yet, this opportunity, she calls Dr. Birx, who is a U.S. Army colonel and literally lead the HIV vaccine global movement. She has received tons of commendation awards under Democratic administrations. She managed $1.5 billion worth of budget. She literally led PEPFAR.  And Behar reduces her to an elderly care nurse. Now, I could compare in contrast Joy Behar's resume to her, but I will not. I don't think I need to.  WATTERS: All right. And you brought up Hillary Clinton. She just endorsed Joe Biden despite growing questions over a sexual assault allegation.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  COMPAGNO: Welcome back. Joe Biden picking up a big endorsement during a women's town hall despite growing questions about a sexual assault allegation, Hillary Clinton being accused of hypocrisy after throwing her support behind the former VP.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER UNITED STATES FIRST LADY: I am thrilled to be part of your campaign, to not only endorse you, but to help highlight a lot of the issues that are at stake in this presidential election. I wish you were president right now to end the kind of disregard, of not only American values, but American institutions, the rule of law, and so much else that is at stake because of the current occupant.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  COMPAGNO: Hillary previously said that women have a right to be believed, but she still went forward with the endorsement. Former Biden staffer, Tara Reade, claims that the then senator sexually assaulted her in 1993, and earlier, re-told Fox News that Hillary Clinton is, quote, ""enabling a sexual predator by backing Biden.""  So Dana, I would like to start with you. Is this Biden's way, with this endorsement, of responding to the sexual assault allegations?  PERINO: It's hard to say -- like, in some ways, I don't understand several of the things that Biden has done this week. He has floated the idea or conspiracy theory, really that President Trump is going to postpone the election. The president pushed back -- the president is not going to postpone the election. The election will be held in November.  He rolled out this Hillary endorsement, which I think was probably scheduled from a long time ago, because what a day to roll it out. And I mentioned yesterday that Henry Rodgers of the Daily Caller had called every single Democratic office on the Senate side and asked what do you think about these allegations from Tara Reade? Nobody responded.  And you have several of those people, including like a Kamala Harris, for example, who might be in the vice president -- the vice presidential sights for Joe Biden who are also remaining silent. And they're in a terrible position because of what they had done in the past.  So, I think Joe Biden would probably be better off if he just did nothing for a while, just let the President be out there and have to handle this crisis. See how he does, because Joe Biden's poll numbers have been fine, without even being out there. All of this that he's done, actually, I think makes things worse for him.  COMPAGNO: Greg, what are your thoughts on the endorsement and or the response to the allegations?  GUTFELD: Well, I mean, the entire town hall felt designed to create a suit of armor around Joe against this sexual assault. Of course, who does he have come in, the great political feminists who dragged all of her husband's victims through the mud. And apparently, we now learn that some sexual assaults matter less than others.  The other thing that kind of bugged me was that Biden was just repeating these platitudes over and over again, he doesn't even know what he's saying half the time. But it was all about gender and inequality. Of course, women are caregivers. We understand that. But every study that I've seen, more men are dying from the Coronavirus than women. But somehow that I believe was left out.  But he had to make it about gender. He had to insert the politics of identity into this horrible thing that is actually uniting a country. But I get it, it's politics, so you got to split people, men versus women. That's what they're doing. But I felt that she was kind of like looking at him like a vulture over a body like waiting for him to go so she could step right in. She was just like, make me V.P., make me V.P. and in a month, I will be P.  COMPAGNO: OK, Jesse, what do you think about that?  WATTERS: I read Chris Stirewalt today and he made that point that, you know, Joe does not have a firm grasp on this nomination. It's a grasp. I wouldn't call it firm. I mean, remember what happened with Al Franken. They dumped that guy over so fast because they thought it created vulnerability with the Roy Moore situation.  And I don't see that happening here but, you know, this guy is not invincible. And to think that Hillary batted an eyelash endorsing Biden under a cloud of sexual assault, one she's done it before, and two, I don't believe Hillary even knows.  The MSN and hasn't even covered this. They've covered it here and there. I mean, what is it -- it had been in the New York Times once or twice, it's been in cnn.com once. And every time it appears in the mainstream media, it's either to poke holes through Reade story, or to characterize the story as Republicans pounce on allegations about Joe.  If you were to use their standard on them, you know, this would be very troubling. This is a concerning pattern with Joe. The mere allegation may make him have to withdraw. I mean, this is what they do all the time. Remember what they did with Kavanaugh. Kavanaugh had to agree to an FBI investigation. And if you didn't, he was guilty.  So, Joe Biden, why don't you agree to an FBI investigation? Because if you don't, you're obviously guilty.  COMPAGNO: Juan, Jesse makes a great point. What are your thoughts on either the vulnerability of Joe or his silence or the potential for opening him up to an FBI investigation that might bolster any credibility he has left?  WILLIAMS: I think this is way, way off the -- way off the target here. We're in the weeds. And you know, it's like people asking the press, people asking now the FBI to do their -- to do their dirty work for the Trump campaign. I mean, that's not it.  I think this woman deserves to be heard. I think that's the problem for Democrats. That's why they're in an awkward position. Jesse was right. In the Kavanaugh case, Democrats were saying every woman has a right to be believed. And in this case, then, you have to apply the same standard or be accused of hypocrisy.  But to me, the larger story here is that he has spoken out and he's very clearly denied it. So most of those people who had been called including Hillary Clinton --  WATTERS: So did Kavanaugh.  WILLIAMS: -- they don't know anymore. Hang on, they don't know any more than any of us know about who is to be believed in a he-said-she-said situation. So to me, that's the hardest -- by the way, you can't delay the election. It's in federal law. The Constitution says when you have to leave. And so, I think going down that hole is useless.  COMPAGNO: All right, next up. A jam-packed plane creating a social distancing nightmare, plus, why you could see a lot of masks on your next fight. Stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WILLIAMS: Welcome back. So much for social distancing. A passenger said she panicked aboard a pack flight from New York to Charlotte. The woman says she was seated next to people who were not wearing masks. So maybe this announcement comes just in time.  JetBlue says they will become the first U.S. airline to require passengers to wear face coverings starting on May 4th. Jesse, are you willing to fly?  WATTERS: It depends on where I'm going along. I think honestly, you got to fly at your own risk until there's a vaccine in this country. I think airlines should require people to wear masks, they should suspend food and beverage, and they should test for antibodies and for the virus. Maybe not in first class, Greg, but you know how this thing is transmitted.  And they should test for antibodies for the stewardesses because I hate to make this point, but there's going to be rough air ahead in the industry. If they have to eliminate middle seats, they're going to start flying flights at a loss. So maybe take the train, maybe do a road trip. There's other options.  WILLIAMS: Greg, you're yelping over there. So do you think they should require masks?  GUTFELD: No. There's so many things that bother me. Number one, how are you going to drink? I'm actually for the masks, but I'm trying to figure out there needs to be a straw-mask combination, so you can still have your vodka and soda. And I do not fly first class, Jesse. Dana and I enter contracts only private. So this won't be a problem for us, right, Dana?  So here -- I know I have time. I have an idea. I've always had this idea called knockout air, where you, you, you fly, right? They come and pick you up at your house. They knock you unconscious with something, and then you wake up at the hotel at your destination so you don't even experience anything. They just slip in a little coffin put you in a plane.  WILLIAMS: So Dana, at the moment, TSA says that their screenings are down 95 percent at airports, so there are very few flights. I haven't even seen an airplane in the sky recently. How are you feeling about flying?  PERINO: Well, I don't really have anywhere to go though. I would like to go see my mom and dad and my sister in Denver at some point. But the good news for Greg and I is this, that they're going to eliminate the middle seat, but we can just fit in the overhead compartment, and then you probably don't even need to worry about it up there because you're protected. So I think he and I are going to be all right.  WILLIAMS: I'll put handles on the two of you. I'll carry you. Emily, the flight -- the planes that I have seen recently were the Blue Angels and the Thunderbirds over New York City and Philadelphia today. I think you've flown on them. Did they give you a mask?  COMPAGNO: No, that actually was supposed to take place next month, so I think with the whole COVID that has been pushed back. But I will say, first of all, Jesse, it's not stewardesses, it's flight attendants now. You have to get into 2020. And I feel like in terms of requiring masks --  WATTERS: I'm sorry.  COMPAGNO: -- if you have an optional policy, of course, not everyone is going to comply. So the whole public shaming and big brother and narcing that's happening, I think it's because everyone is feeling out of control, and they just want to have some type of control over something. And in that argument, it always ends with well, it's life or death.  So the airline's either need to make that policy something and have everyone wear a mask or not, and know that you might be the only one wearing a mask on the flight if it's important to.  WILLIAMS: A protester confronts Bill de Blasio, accusing the New York Mayor of breaking stay at home rules. That video up next on THE FIVE.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PERINO: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has preached the importance of staying at home, even telling residents to report each other for not social distancing. But now the mayor is getting called out after taking a leisurely stroll through a park about 11 miles from his house. Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Seriously, you guys have a park. You live in the middle of a park. You don't need to not essentially travel to Brooklyn. This is so terribly selfish. You call yourself a progressive, but you chauffeur yourself to Brooklyn.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: All right, Greg, I want to get your take on this. You have to love it.  GUTFELD: This is -- this is so hard. Don't make me defend de Blasio. He's the worst mayor in history. He's screwed New York telling people to go out, you know, weeks into this mess, putting everybody at risk. Then after you put everybody at risk, he told people to narc on the people he put at risk. He shoveled millions of dollars in power and influence to his wife.  We still don't know where the $800 million went to that help the homeless and the mentally ill. He is a ghastly, ghastly creature. But screaming at him, just makes him look sympathetic and makes you look like a jerk.  PERINO: Yes, it does. But Juan, what about the merits of it? I mean, he is basically telling all of us New Yorkers to not do what he just did.  WILLIAMS: Yes, it pains me to disagree with Greg. But, Greg, this guy -- this guy says he's the mayor and he tells people to stay home, shelter in place, and then he goes -- he takes I guess a chauffeur-driven car 11 miles to Brooklyn. That's just poor leadership. That's -- you're supposed to lead by example. Where is the example there? I mean, I'm told he wants fireworks considering a parade --  PERINO: Well, hey, Jesse, at least he was wearing a mask.  GUTFELD: Wait a minute. So Juan is right and I am wrong. I've changed everything I'm going to say that Juan is right, I was wrong.  PERINO: Jesse, I would say hey, Bill de Blasio, he was wearing a mask.  WATTERS: I'm going to have to disagree with Juan. I agree with Greg on this, and here's why. You're supposed to go outside and get exercise number one. So what if he went to Brooklyn. He's the mayor of every borough, and he needs to check out what's going on in the city. He's got to see who's out, who's not, what the deal is. And I also take issue with the quality of that ambush.  You never let the target get in front of you and just follow him and then you get his back. You have to stay in the front.  GUTFELD: You know, leave it to -- leave it to Jesse.  PERINO: Emily, what about this idea of having Neighbors tell on each other? I don't like that.  COMPAGNO: I hate that. I hate a neighborhood narc so much like every cell in my body is screams with fury at that. And so that's why to me, this is amazing because de Blasio is the worst of all time. And this is just him getting exactly what he told everyone else to do, which is narc on each other.  And to Juan's point, a real leader leads by example. So this guy is just basically being a rat by example. So go ahead, break the rules that you've set, and then get embarrassed for a shoddy ambush. We won't -- we won't, you know, resist that.  PERINO: I got to tell you, that was the best segment you'll see on Fox all day. Indeed, I love it. All right, ""ONE MORE THING"" is up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: Time for ""ONE MORE THING."" Jesse?  WATTERS: A big congratulations to our very own Ed Henry who's writing a book Saving Colleen: A Memoir of the Unbreakable Bond Between a Brother and Sister. As you know, Ed gave his liver to his sister. Everybody thought that was a beautiful thing except Greg Gutfeld. People keep asking how Colleen is doing during the COVID-19 pandemic, and she's doing great.  That was her getting her blood tests. She's doing much better. And Ed is doing better to his. He's back to drinking after donating his liver to his sister. Her liver is healthy. Ed is probably less healthy now that he's drinking than his sister's. So on September 15, you can go get this book or you can pre-order it. There it is saving Colleen.  GUTFELD: What a gratuitous way to get a book, donating your liver. What are you going to do? You follow up, you're going to give a kidney to Brian Kilmeade? Juan, sorry. Dana, sorry, Dana, you're up.  PERINO: It's OK. It's OK. So many of you know that I started a thing 10 years ago called minute mentoring. It's like speed dating but mentoring for young women. Well, tonight in the time of Coronavirus, and the pandemic and the lockdown, I'm going to host at 7:00 p.m. tonight a live minute mentoring session with a friend of mine, Lydia Fenet. And she is the managing director at Christie's. Of course, that's the big auctioneer. And she wrote a book called The Most Powerful Woman in the Room is You.  So we've got questions that we're taking from young women who submitted them on social media. Not just women. If you've got a question, you're a guy, send it -- send us our way. We're just going to talk about navigating your career during the pandemic and you can watch us on Instagram @MinuteMentoring. You just check us out there at 7:00 p.m.  GUTFELD: Excellent. Juan?  WILLIAMS: OK, folks, I want you to drop down and give me five push-ups. Yep. That's what Melinda Ligeikis would tell her gym class and Binghamton, New York. But with students out of school due to the coronavirus, of course, she's come up with a new way for her high school students to stay in shape. Take a look.  Yes, she's using -- she's using broomsticks, she's using shoe boxes, she's using milk cartons for one to two-minute daily fitness challenges. These bite-sized videos have proven to be a hit not only with their students, but with their families. Now that's one terrific teacher. She's not let the virus stop her from keeping her young students engaged and active. Thank you, Miss Ligeikis. I guess that's just great teaching.  GUTFELD: Wow. Well, you know, it's me -- it's me now. It's not often, it's never a fact that I'm wrong until today. I did a mistake in my math calculations. In fact, I said that a half a percent of 1,000 is 50 when in fact it's five. But my point still stands because five is so five times that of one. I will not throw the producers under the bus on this one. I will not do that. I will not say the producers should have caught this.  And -- but that's -- I have to take responsibility for that. The producers -- it wasn't the producer's fault that they had this monologue all day and failed to math, but it's not their fault. The responsibility lies with me and not the producer Mike LaMarca. Let's roll this.  PERINO: Wait, you said that I checked your math.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Animals are great. Animals are great. Animals are great.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Oh, gosh, that was fun. All right, let's take a look at this little guy. A very curious little cat. Check him out. He's being tricked by some kind of like bushy headed thing. Look at that. What could that be? Oh, look at that face. Look at that. Isn't that adorable. Yes, it doesn't know what to do. It doesn't know what to do.  This video actually goes on for 13 hours. Something that I like to watch when I am cramped up at home weeping quietly. So Emily, I think it's your turn. Try to say something at normal human speed.  COMPAGNO: I love the producers. I think they are all amazing. All right, I have a really special home prom story for you guys. So you know that I love the U.S. Veterans Corps and I'm a constant champion for the good works that they do for the veteran and combat community.  And they have a hero home endeavor. And their hero home 20 recipient was a U.S. Army Goldstar widow named Amy Dozier. And she moved into the house in November after losing her husband, Staff Sergeant Jonathan Dozier in Iraq in 2008.  Now she decided to host a prom for her two nieces. She said, look, my nieces Taylor and Parker had these gorgeous prom dresses but no prom to go to, so I had them come over and I ended up DJing in the street with my sister. But it turned into a full neighborhood prom. The whole neighborhood came out, all the kids in the street dance together six feet apart. She said it was a wonderful night and a perfect for those two well-deserving girls.  GUTFELD: Excellent. All right set your DVRs. Never miss an episode of THE FIVE. ""SPECIAL REPORT"" is up next.

16,FOX,"Outlets ignore sexual assault allegation against Joe Biden. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. In case you missed it, check out this CNN headline: ""Trump goes into hiding."" I guess CNN should know. Hide and seek is their expertise. Take the story of Tara Reade, former Vice President Joe Biden’s accuser. LIZ PEEK: BIDEN ASSAULT ALLEGATIONS TURN RACE ON ITS HEAD — HERE'S WHY As she gains credibility, who loses it? CNN. After all, they've avoided this story, even as evidence appeared on CNN decades ago, when the accuser's mom mentioned the alleged assault to Larry King: LARRY KING: San Luis Obispo, California, hello. JEANETTE ALTIMUS, MOTHER OF BIDEN ACCUSER: Yes, hello. I’m wondering what a staffer would do besides go to the press in Washington? My daughter has just left there, after working for a prominent senator, and could not get through with her problems at all, and the only thing she could have done was go to the press, and she chose not to do it out of respect for him. KING: So she had a story to tell but, out of respect for the person she worked for, she didn’t tell it? ALTIMUS: That’s true. You’ve got to love CNN for avoiding a story that appeared on CNN. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER This video was not unearthed by Fox News, but by The Intercept, Glenn Greenwald's progressive outfit. And what did CNN do? What do you expect? Forget President Trump “hiding.” CNN is now hiding from CNN. CNN ran hundreds of stories on Brett Kavanaugh -- with flimsier accusations. Meanwhile, the Biden accuser: So, where's CNN’s story? Their silence is the story. They're protecting Biden so he can be president. And Reade? The media has tossed her story into the Juanita Broaddrick file of crimes that never happened because liberals allegedly committed them. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Thank God, CNN did some heroic work during Trump’s first term, though. Chasing down people who posted memes. Which is really the second part of this story. The media will protect you if they like you -- and destroy you if they don't. Adapted from Greg Gutfeld's monologue on ""The Five"" on April 27, 2020. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM GREG GUTFELD"
17,FOX,"'Squad' member blasts President Trump's coronavirus response. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. Far-left Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., claims President Trump's coronavirus response is akin to a war crime. ""The virus does not discriminate by race, income or immigration status,"" Pressley said. ""And neither should our relief efforts. This hurt is unprecedented, it is being felt by everyone, and the relief should be felt by everyone. ... So as far as I’m concerned, what’s happening with this administration, it’s akin to war crimes. Criminal negligence, science denials, a sluggish response."" So I guess we can compare her response to Trump to childish drivel. To put it politely, she's badly informed. Can you blame her? Apparently, she's just been watching the news. SEN. TIM SCOTT: CORONAVIRUS — AN UNSEEN ENEMY IS HITTING US HARD BUT WE WILL OVERCOME. HERE'S HOW I KNOW ""Do you think there is blood on the president's hands considering the slow response?"" MSNBC's Chuck Todd recently asked. ""More are still going to die because of Donald Trump’s incompetence and lack of leadership,"" said MSNBC's John Heilemann. MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell claimed, ""More people are dead and dying in America tonight because Donald Trump is president."" CNN's Jim Acosta said, ""He became the chaos president, but what the American people want right now, and they're not getting, is a coronavirus president."" Events like these expose how in-sync the media are with the left-wing narrative. It's almost impossible to tell them apart from lefties like Pressley. Of course, the timeline really reveals Trump acted more quickly than many other so-called leaders, who were too busy thinking about impeachment. Politico described one early White House coronavirus briefing as ""sparsely attended"" because it was on the same day as a deadline for senators to submit their impeachment questions. Almost no one showed, except, of course, the virus. So, how many lives did impeachment cost? And what's it costing now? It's a shame. You'd think we could put politics behind us, like paper on a roll. But the media and their prized political pupils prefer division. Pressley said relief shouldn't discriminate based on race. Wow, thanks. Has anyone even mentioned that playing a role? It's against the law. And common sense. No wonder she didn't know. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER And for 99 percent of Americans, race doesn't play. Pressley is distraught, because all the identity politics BS she built her career on, has gone bye-bye. Like Antifa and Black Lives Matter, the ""oppressed Olympics"" have been preempted by reality. We see human suffering and sacrifice, not tribalism. All that's left are opportunists creating a false threat, to blame on Trump. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It's a hoax crime.

20,FOX," This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" April 17, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino, along with Jesse Watters, Juan Williams, Greg Gutfeld, and Katie Pavlich. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is The Five.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We can begin the next front in our war, which we are calling opening up America again. We must have a working economy. And we want to get it back very, very quickly. And that's what's going to happen. I believe it will boom.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: All right, that was the president, obviously. He was preparing the nation for the next front in this war against COVID-19. And as the White House releases their guidelines for states to reopen, carefully, that is, and in three separate phases.  The coronavirus task force will be coming out again in an hour from now for their Friday update. So, in the meantime we will break it all down.  First of all, the first phase could see the reopening of gyms, restaurants, maybe theaters, and sport venues, but with strict social distancing measures in place. Schools would stay closed, and high-risk individuals would stay home.  The other phases would then loosen restrictions more if cases continue to fall. But there are some critics of the plan including Speaker Nancy Pelosi calling those guidelines, quote, ""vague and inconsistent."" And here is more reaction from other Democrats.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think what he has kind of done is punted. He has decided that he is not -- he doesn't have the right to make the call for the country.  SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER: You have to know who has the illness, who is immune from the illness and who can -- who could get the illness before we can determine who can go back to work.  GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): OK, it's up to the states, but then don't ask the states, don't give them this massive undertaking that has never been done before and then not give them any resources to do it.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: All right, happy Friday. Greg, I want to start with you.  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Yes.  (CROSSTALK)  KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS HOST: Happy Friday.  PERINO: It's -- I thought I'd give a little bit of perspective just to set this up, because in a way all of us sort of feel like it's Groundhog's Day. It's been about four weeks now that we've been doing the show remotely, at least I have from here.  And last Friday was the end of the week of which Jerome Adams, the surgeon general had said that this is going to be our Pearl Harbor moment, that was when we had hopefully reaching the apex and the peak. This week we are talking about the reopening. And we have some guidance. Some of it is vague because the states are going to have to decide based on their different criteria.  But isn't that a little bit of a hopeful sign that it's not just one big block that we actually can look at some progress here?  GUTFELD: Yes, I don't see anything here that is vague. I see a roadmap and you are allowed to drive it. What drives me crazy is that if Trump had taken more command over this. Instead, this is what you're going to do, they would've accused him of being autocratic, a dictator and a tyrant.  So, what does he do? He shares the responsibility with the governors. He says here's the road map, you drive the car. And now he is accused of punting by Joe Biden? Are you serious? It is so pathetic.  And then I predicted this yesterday, I said that Pelosi wasn't going to say anything until after the plan is revealed because she did not want any skin in this game. She preferred to get stand in front of her double wide refrigerator and suck down ice cream until she gets an ice cream headache than actually offer practical advice.  You know, you can sit on a fence and you could, you know, crap on people doing the job when you are out of power, that make sense. But at this point, it's just so obvious and so sad. In this situation, people's lives are going to, there is going to be death. Because every path that we choose is going to have death. So, the path that you have to choose is a road map in which you can go in reverse. Or you can pause. Or you can take a left or a right.  PERINO: Yes.  GUTFELD: That's what this is. You are a stick -- you are a sports car with a stick shift, and you shift gears based on the terrain that's coming at you. And you could even go in reverse. That's what this guideline is. So, to sit there and go like, it's vague and inconsistent, you're just an idiot. Pure and simple, stick to your ice cream.  PERINO: That's of course, Pelosi. And I think that we have a couple of Trump tweets today and then a Cuomo sound bite. If you could pull those up those Trump tweets so I could read those for folks who are maybe listening on the radio.  So, President Trump tweeted this morning that Governor Cuomo should spend more time doing and less time complaining. Get out there and get the job done. Stop talking. We built you thousands of hospital beds that you didn't need or use, gave large numbers of ventilators that you should have had and helped you with.  Let's see there's a little bit more, testing that you should be doing. We have given New York far more money, help, and equipment than any other state by far, and these great men and women who did the job never hear you say thanks. Your numbers are not good. Less talk and more action.  I think he does say thank you a lot quite a bit to the healthcare workers, but Governor Cuomo decided to respond. We have a sound bite of that. Let's listen.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  CUOMO: First of all, if he is sitting home watching TV, maybe he should get up and go to work, right? Second, the -- let's keep emotion and politics out of this and personal ego if we can, because this is about the people. It is about our job. And let's try to focus on that.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: All right, Juan, I'll let you take a whack at this one.  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, you know, I hate to see us get political about this. I mean, I think that we need to work together. And I would hope that, you know, sometimes the president loves to be celebrated and thanked and all of that. OK.  So, Cuomo then fires back. I don't -- I'm not sure it takes as much of anywhere. But I will say this. In terms of the plan, Dana, to me, I feel like everybody has got cabin fever.  We know about the high unemployment numbers. Everybody wants to get out and get back to work but we have to be careful. We can't let sort of emotions that, you know, drive us, and impatience, because if we don't have testing, if we don't have contact tracing, then we can get ourselves in a very difficult situation where we put our workers, the people going back to work at a very high level of risk, and we put all of their customers, the people they come into contact with, work with --  PERINO: Yes.  WILLIAMS: -- also at risk. Then we can find ourselves in a worse situation. So I think when you hear people say, we'd like to know how to deal with that, and we'd like the federal government's help, I think in terms of specifics, what Schumer was talking about, even what you heard from Governor Cuomo in terms of, OK, if you lay out a plan, give us some of the resources to make it work, I think that's what people are saying. I don't think it has to necessarily become sort of --  PERINO: All right.  WILLIAMS: -- something nasty and divisive and finger-pointing.  PERINO: Got it. And actually, Katie, I saw -- there were lots of different governors on the -- Greg is laughing, but I'll just keep going. Lots of different governors on the shows today talking about how they are working in coordination with the federal government and they're trying to figure out their own road map. So, there is the Colorado governor, the Alaska governor, Ohio, and all of these states have a little bit of a different situation on their hands.  PAVLICH: Which is exactly why the president has said it's up to you guys, do what you want with this plan, it's going to be in phases, different places with a lower density population. They are going to have a different project and process moving forward on this.  But it's interesting to watch what's happening here in D.C. or not in D.C. where lawmakers are at home. You have Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi criticizing this plan, and continually saying that you have to be careful, you have to make sure the economy isn't open too quickly.  Well, when they are sitting there at home and not refilling the paycheck protection plan with or program, and not coming up with any other ideas about how to get people some economic health while they continue to advocate for the economy to be close, it's really easy to do that.  And it's also easy to do that when you are getting a paycheck. And the bottom line, I think for people who are getting cabin fever as one said, is they want to be able to make their own decisions about their own risk.  At this point they understand a lot more about the virus than we did two months ago, and they understand what precautions they need to take to not get sick, but they really want to be able to do that on their own without being dictated to by the government.  PERINO: All right, Jesse, let me give you the last word here.  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, I mean, if Democrats have a problem with the plan, take it up with Fauci and Birx. They are the experts that signed off on it. And then there's Cuomo, everybody on the left loves him they want him to run for president, so President Trump gives him free power and they say, he can't handle it, he can't do it by himself all of a sudden.  Cuomo is complaining about not getting the resources, he just donated hundreds of ventilators to other states because he had overcapacity. Because the president gave him so many. They just built hospital in Long Island they haven't even used it yet.  So, I would stop complaining already before the president has even given you any additional resources. This -- the country is viewing this from two different perspectives. There are people that are better off, that are kind of having a little fun, may be working from home, they are still getting paid. They are zooming, you know, they are doing their thing, they're cooking. And then there's people that can't afford to work from home.  They don't have a job. They have lost a business which had been in their family for generations. And they're dying to get back to work. And one side doesn't understand the other side. You know, how could you not want to protect the health? What about if it spreads further?  And then the other side is saying, wait a second, you guys understanding my position, I need to work to feed my family. Or else, this is it for me. And they are talking across of each other, and a lot of it has to do with New York.  The state of New York has 225,000 cases. New Jersey has 75,000 cases. Combined that's 300,000 virus cases. The next biggest state that has that case is like 30,000 in Massachusetts. Other states like Wyoming, North Dakota, Hawaii, Vermont, West Virginia, they have a couple hundred cases.  And so, to say that to New York should open up at the same rate as Vermont which has like a handful of cases is stupid. Everybody knows that's stupid. But they are trying to attack the president for politics. And that's just wrong.  PERINO: All right. Good discussion, guys. Coming up next, protests continue to rage across the country against strict stay-at-home orders which we were just kind of just talking about. Stay tuned. We'll tell you more.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WATTERS: Protests are spreading across the country against strict stay-at- home orders, breaking out in states like Michigan, Kentucky, Virginia, and Minnesota. They're calling on governors to roll back what they say are the more arbitrary and restrictive measures.  Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer is facing at least two federal lawsuits over her stay-at-home order which includes a ban on visits to friends or relatives. And protesters they are getting no sympathy from liberal View HOST Joy Behar. She mocked their concerns with this comment.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JOY BEHAR, ABC HOST: Well, I would like to ask them if they are willing to sign away their right to treatment if and when they get affected. Are you going to say, OK, I don't need a ventilator, because I thought that I should go out and defy the governor's order?  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: All right, Katie, you mentioned the other day about some sort of regulation they had in Michigan they can't buy seeds to grow food. I heard another one today, if you live in Detroit or something like that and you have a summer home outside in the suburbs or something, you can't leave Detroit and go stay at your second residence. It's crazy.  PAVLICH: Right. It's ridiculous and it's very personal for these people. And I don't really understand what Joy Behar is saying.  First of all, we've been able to buy some time with getting the hospitals ready and the equipment and beds that they need to handle the situation moving forward, but also what she says is like driving a car and getting a car accident and then saying that you're not allowed to go to the hospital because you got in an accident and made the choice to go do that.  I think that people are smart enough to make their own decisions about understanding the risk. They understand if they don't want to get sick, they don't have to go out, but they don't want to be told that they can't do basic things like garden on their own property. That's the first thing.  The second thing is, you know, in this new plan, one of the things that stuck out to me and the road map that the White House put out is elective surgeries in phase one will now be allowed to resume. That I think is such a crucial point, because elective surgery includes biopsies for cancer detection.  I've heard from doctors who have said they were unable to operate on their breast cancer patients at this point. I mention our family friend who has a collapsed lung. And just think about how much damage that is doing to people's health and mental health as a result of not being able to get to the healthcare that they need in those circumstances.  So, there are consequences to all of these things. I don't think that they are all arbitrary. But in Michigan they certainly have been, which is why you are seeing people say enough is enough, I'm essential, it's essential to feed my family and provide for myself. I make my own decisions.  WATTERS: Yes, Greg, I heard another regulation that they have up there in Michigan, you are allowed to kayak, but you can't go out in a motorboat. Figure that one out for me.  GUTFELD: I can't. I can't. I just want to point out that Joe -- Joy -- Joy makes a fabulous living as a feminist bozo the clown, so she doesn't understand the need to make money or the need to work. She just shows up and spouts whatever.  We trust our leaders until they push their luck. And what happened was you had a governor, micro micromanaging in kind of an arbitrary fashion. I mean, you can't buy seeds, but you can buy pot.  I remember when I was young, you would buy pot and all you got were seeds. So, the protests aren't --  WATTERS: Yes.  GUTFELD: -- the protests aren't about staying at home. They are more about the kind of the arbitrary micromanagement. One more thing, you know, she pointed out that she saw Swastikas at the rally, and she didn't -- and she did. I think she did see them, but there is a distinction. The protesters were comparing her actions to fascist dictators.  It wasn't that there were Nazis there, it was that they were unfairly. They were unfairly comparing her to Hitler, which is wrong. But one should make that distinction, because what she was saying was that there was Nazis there because she saw Swastikas.  WATTERS: Greg, what the heck is on your shirt by the way?  GUTFELD: This is a legendary misfit's shirt, but it's got a mask on it. Isn't it awesome? It's an icon.  WATTERS: OK.  GUTFELD: I got it from Jerry Only. I'm glad you ask.  WATTERS: I got it. All right. I'm glad I -- I'm not sure I'm glad I did.  Dana Perino, you mentioned the other day about the governor of Michigan, she was kind of on a short-list to be V.P., may have mishandled that opportunity to kind of show her strength as a governor. She now says she is going to have a plan to reopen next week. Is it too late for her?  PERINO: Well, it might be too late for her to be on the V.P. short-list, because I think that, you know, that debut --  WATTERS: Yes.  PERINO: -- was not so good. And I think what happened is she got caught up in the national political currents, and now she'll be swept out to sea. There are other examples though of governors who have done a pretty good job of ignoring the national politics and avoiding that and speaking very clearly to their states.  I think Governor Charlie Baker up in Massachusetts is one of them. I put Governor Polis of Colorado in that basket as well. It doesn't mean they won't have protests of people complaining about the lockdowns.  But I do think that from a governor standpoint, that leadership, when you are looking to see who is doing a good job and who isn't, you can compare those governors to somebody like Governor Northam in Virginia who all of a sudden today said, OK, or yesterday said we're going to be lockdown till June 10th. But didn't give any more reasons or data or explanations.  And this idea that Katie was just talking about, about elective surgeries. There are a lot of hospitals across the country that are desperate for patients. They are running out of money. And Nancy Pelosi and Schumer say that they want to hold up the money for the small businesses because they want to help the hospital.  Well, one of the ways to help the hospitals would be allow the governors to make that decision to allow for hospitals that can handle it to do these elective surgeries. Then you won't have to give them so many taxpayer dollars in order to take care of their short fall.  WATTERS: That's a really good point. Juan, bring it home for us.  WILLIAMS: By the way, I just want to underline what Dana just said, because you know, I know some doctors in my family. And again, the hospitals are struggling. And people who do need to have the elective surgeries. In some cases, they have to let doctors who are not in the emergency rooms and the like, they have to lay them off or put them on leave for a while, because they are not getting the income from those surgeries.  Over all, though, I would say, you know, I don't want to see this become a big political fight. And the thing with these rallies, you know, the president tweeting today, liberate Minnesota. Liberate Michigan, and the flags at the rally, they're Trump flags, it makes it seem so political.  And I think people are right to sometimes say to government, don't be intrusive. You know, don't step on my rights. We are going to act together. And America has acted together in terms of social distancing, in terms of the hand washing, everything to lower the curve.  So, we don't want to give that up just suddenly and without reason. I think you've got to give some leeway to elected officials who are looking out for the public's health. But you -- I don't think we want to politicize this so that, certain people think this way, certain people -- no, let's not do that with this.  This is too important and too deadly. I was shocked. Shocked, Jesse, to see it was 2,200 people, I think died in America yesterday, and 2,500 on Wednesday. Over 33,000 Americans dead as a result of this. This is serious business.  WATTERS: I would agree with you, Juan, we do not want to see this politicize.  Coming up, it's basket of deplorables all over again, may be. Joe Biden's attack on Trump voters is next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WILLIAMS: Welcome back.  The Trump campaign is accusing Joe Biden of a deplorables moment, just like what happened with Hillary Clinton's famous remark, or infamous remark, I should say, in 2016.  The presumptive Democratic nominee, Biden, was talking about Trump supporter's when he said this. There are people who support the president because they like the fact that he is engaged in the politics of division. They really support the notion that, you know, all Mexicans are rapists, and all Muslims are bad, dividing this nation based on ethnicity and race.  So, Jesse, I thought I'd come to you and just ask the obvious question, I mean, isn't it true that the president can say some divisive, polarizing things?  WATTERS: Yes, but so do Democrats, it's a wash. It's politics. It doesn't really bother me that much. The point is this, Juan. Joe Biden is supposed to be the Democratic that can win over disaffected Trump supporter's in places like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. The white working-class men and women of this country.  That's his whole appeal. And then he goes and says something like this. He is supposed to be the guy. Yes, Mitch McConnell is going to work with me when I get in there. I'm going to restore dignity and civility and honor and that kind, and then he goes and says this.  Do I think it's the same thing as the basket of deplorables with Hillary? No, but it's not good. And he just hasn't had a great run since this started. He botched the travel ban. It took two weeks for them to set up a home camera in his library. Then when they did get the feed up, he was -- couldn't communicate effectively. Then he got hit with a sexual assault allegation, and now this. it's like, you know, he's not performing well in a time when, you know, you're either a prime time player you're not.  WILLIAMS: That's a fair point. So Katie, I think from the Joe Biden perspective, people think, oh, Joe Biden is supposed to be a guy who's calm and a healer and more empathetic, but I don't think that he would play to the way -- I don't think he plays the Trump game, which Trump has played to obvious success.  PAVLICH: Juan, one look at Joe Biden's history shows that he's not a guy who has a long temper, that someone who is -- not someone who doesn't want to fight in political battles. I mean, Joe Biden is not a very nice guy when it comes to the political game. And he's been portrayed as such to kind of rewrite his own history and record, but he's not that kind of person.  The reason why you have Donald Trump sitting in the White House, the big reason is because people got very sick of the political correctness garbage, of being accused of being a racist just because you disagreed with some kind of policy. If you want to close borders or more border security, you didn't like -- you were xenophobic and didn't like immigrants for some reason. That was pushed aside.  And for Joe Biden to now alienate those voters that, as Jesse pointed out, he needs shows that again, his campaign keeps throwing things up against the wall, and nothing is sticking. If that's the final argument that you're trying to make, you're losing.  WILLIAMS: So, Dana, I was just struck by the idea that -- I don't know that Joe Biden really could win voters who are hardcore Trump supporters at this point. The Trump's base has never really gone away. They're there around 40, 45 percent in all the polls I see.  PERINO: Yes, it's got an uphill battle. But remember, he was the one that said that if you are an Obama-Trump voter, that his pitch was that he could win those people back. And this kind of language is obviously not going to do that.  It's also strange to me that, you know, he was the person that was going to be able to appeal to the lunch pail crowd. And a weak nominee would try to continue to win over his base over and over again, a strong nominee would start to veer to the middle. And he's not doing that right now.  So -- I also saw that somebody suggesting that Elizabeth Warren really would be a good nominee for him. He doesn't need to pick her as his VP. He already got her endorsement. She didn't win her own state. She probably couldn't win a single -- help him win a single battleground state. I mean, I don't think -- that one, you could probably just cross off your list.  WILLIAMS: So Greg, I think that everybody is saying the president is the president in terms of how he acts, how he behaves. I mean, he, he goes after Democrats, he goes after the Mexicans. He goes -- I think he goes after --  GUTFELD: He goes after the Mexicans? When did he go after the Mexicans?  WILLIAMS: When he was coming down --  GUTFELD: When did he go after the Mexicans?  WILLIAMS: When he was coming down the escalator.  GUTFELD: No, he was after -- he was talking about criminals, illegal immigrants who are criminals, but that's OK. What you're conflating, and I understand this, is that what Trump does, he actually goes after a person. The problem with what Hillary did and what Joe Biden does is they go after the people.  You can go after the person, but when you go after the people, it looks really, really bad. By the way, to Dana's point about Liz Warren endorsing Biden, is that kind of interesting that she was the woman who absolutely destroyed Bloomberg, who would have been a better candidate over sexual harassment, but then just adores the guy who's being accused of sexually assaulting a woman. I think that's pretty amazing.  WATTERS: Good point.  GUTFELD: But back to the -- back to the original point. I wonder how many blacks did Joe Biden and Kamala Harris put behind bars versus how many blacks Donald Trump released with prison reform? That would be an interesting survey.  WILLIAMS: Yes, we could check with the Central Park Five.  GUTFELD: I don't know what that means, Juan.  WILLIAMS: Straight ahead, some people are getting way, way too comfortable while working from home. That story up next on THE FIVE.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PAVLICH: Welcome back time for ""THE FASTEST SEVEN."" First up -- first up, plenty of people are objecting to this freaky new trend. A Miami judge was forced to remind lawyers to wear shirts for Zoom hearings. And over in Maryland, a police department there issuing a stark warning to residents who have been taking daily trips to the mailbox without pants. Jess, are you guilty of this?  WATTERS: I am. Yesterday, I took a professional FaceTime call and I didn't have a shirt on. And the guy at the other end was like Watters, what are you doing? And I just said -- I just didn't ever shirt on. I wasn't completely naked, but you know, it comes with the territory during these times.  PAVLICH: Yes, Greg isn't this --  PERINO: I can safely say that has not happen to me.  (CROSSTALK)  PAVLICH: Dana wears pants when she goes to the mailbox.  GUTFELD: I think what we're missing here is no one is asking, how are the nudists handling this? Has anyone checked your local like nudist camp to see if there's -- if they're actually wearing masks. Are they keeping their distance? I think this is worthy of a primetime Bret Baier investigation. Bear at all with Bret Baier.  PAVLICH: So Juan, you're in a suit and tie, but what is your regular apparel during the day?  WILLIAMS: Well, you know yesterday, Katie, I did -- the first time I did something on Zoom that was professional, because I did one of these things for Fox Nation where they picked, you know, your top five. So Carley Shimkus who's a Fox anchor and I did top five movies and went over it.  And I just could see myself and I thought hey, wait a second. Here I am in this schmucky little t-shirt. You know, it says Washington Nationals, and in the back, you can see all my gear and books and stuff. It didn't look very nice. I thought, I got to do a better job at dressing presume. This is going to be the next thing.  We're going to have to get -- what's the name of that Japanese lady who does all the ordering of things? We got to get her to help me out.  PERINO: Marie Kondo.  PAVLICH: Marie Kondo.  WILLIAMS: Yes, that's it.  PAVLICH: I think Zoom attire is an interesting concept that we will -- fashion will soon see. So, next topic, some students may be saying A is for awesome after hearing this new grading proposal. Officials in San Francisco are weighing the idea of giving all students A grades for the remainder of the year due to Coronavirus school closures. Dana, is this a good idea?  PERINO: I can imagine that the school districts are just trying to figure out what in the world are they going to do. I don't necessarily think that just giving everybody an A is the answer. I think maybe just giving everybody, you know, an X and basically saying we're going to not count this, or if they have been able to complete online schoolwork and the teachers are satisfied with it, great accordingly if possible. But I don't envy these teachers and school districts or the parents who are really trying so hard to keep up with the studies for their kids as well as doing their jobs at home.  PAVLICH: Jesse, you take the A?  WATTERS: Oh, I'd take it in a heartbeat. I'm saying, there's got to be massive grade inflation right now, because if you're taking the test at home, you're either getting your parents to help you or you're cheating. So I don't see how anybody can get below an A anyway.  PERINO: I wouldn't.  GUTFELD: Of course.  PAVLICH: Greg, over to you.  GUTFELD: You know what's going to be amazing? What will happen to the public school administrators when they find out that all these kids got smarter at home? Because school is a system -- is a system that is impervious to time management. And I think the real fear is people's going to find out that if you -- homeschooling could pretty much do eight years of grade school in three and a half.  PAVLICH: I think that's a valid point. All right, next up, a man's best friend could soon be jumping headfirst into the fight against the coronavirus. London scientists are in the early stages of training dogs to detect asymptomatic cases using their amazing sense of smell. Juan, amazing scientific development.  WILLIAMS: I think it's wonderful. That'd be great. You know, dogs obviously help us out at the airports, everywhere else, in terms of sniffing out bombs, even chemicals. So, you know, it's just a gift. If that was true, that'd be wonderful.  And by the way, on the issue about the kids, I think that they -- the bigger issue there is the kids losing time Katie, and how it would impact them next school year or in their terms of their future. That's really tough. Otherwise, I say, give Jesse that A. Give him that A. Go for it.  PAVLICH: Yes. Sorry, Juan, I jumped ahead on you on that story there. Dana, the dogs are saving the day again.  PERINO: I think it's amazing. Talk about contact tracing. It would just be terrific if we could be able to use them to help us as well as they do with -- like kids that have epilepsy or diabetes. That's a -- that's an exciting development.  PAVLICH: Greg, animals are great.  GUTFELD: If we could have more dogs sniffing out disease as opposed to sniffing drugs in airports, I would champion this progress to the heavens. Sniff out the sickness, stay away from my back pocket.  PAVLICH: All right, Jessie, final word on the dogs to you.  WATTERS: Rookie has been sniffing me kind of funny. I think I better get tested.  PAVLICH: Put some pants on first though, a shirt. All right, don't go anywhere. ""FAN MAIL FRIDAY"" is up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: Yes, that's a happy song. ""FAN MAIL FRIDAY,"" let's get it started from Mark. Did you have to postpone anything major due to this virus? Juan, did you have to postpone anything?  WILLIAMS: Well, speeches, obviously. And no one is having big meetings, you know, Greg. So I think that's one thing. And then, you know, it's springtime. I didn't have a birthday party. And thanks to you guys, I had one here. But so yes, something's got postponed.  GUTFELD: Yes, Dana, how about you? What did you postpone, a book club meeting?  PERINO: No, I still had those. But there was a long weekend trip that we had planned with our friends down in the Caribbean. And so that got pushed off till next year, hopefully.  GUTFELD: All right, Katie, what did you have to postpone? We're all suffering.  PAVLICH: I had to postpone -- we're all suffering?  GUTFELD: Yes, I am being --  PAVLICH: I have postponed an Arizona desert bighorn sheep society conservation project in Arizona which I was really bummed about because you get to use power tools and shovels and camp out in the desert and have a bonfire. So hopefully I get to one of those in the fall.  GUTFELD: Jesse?  WATTERS: I had to postpone all my elective surgeries like my nose job, my calf implants, my hair plugs, all that kind of stuff.  GUTFELD: You know what, I never would have noticed. But the funny -- I have -- I have like a wart on the bottom of my foot. I'll just leave it at that.  PAVLICH: Electrosurgeries need to come back.  GUTFELD: Yes, plant or whatever you call it. Plant or whatever, it's pain?  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Yes, yes, it's driving me crazy. I'm truly really suffering. OK, what is the one experience in your childhood that will always be first in your memory? Dana, I'm going to you first and I imagine has to do with some kind of animal.  PERINO: Yes, I actually think -- well, it's sometimes hard to remember if you're remembering a photograph or remembering the actual thing.  GUTFELD: Exactly.  PERINO: I did --my grandfather on my dad's side on the ranch, he got me a pony named Sally. And I know that I grew up loving this horse. And I feel like I remember that, but I think it might have been just from the photograph.  GUTFELD: A pony named Sally. That's a good Johnny Cash song that was never written. Jesse, what's your first experience in childhood that you remember?  WATTERS: Well, we were at the Barnum and Bailey Circus, and my parents just handed me over to a bunch of clowns. And they took me to the basement of the spectrum in Philadelphia and they lined me up with a bunch of other children.  And then they brought me out in front of like, 30,000 people and hoisted me up on an elephant. And they rode this elephant around and around in front of all these fans. I was terrified. I missed my family. I didn't know what was going on, and now I'm terrified of clowns.  GUTFELD: Are you sure that wasn't a dream you had as a child?  WILLIAMS: That was great.  WATTERS: No, that was true. That was true.  GUTFELD: That's like out of like the 90s like satanic abuse stories you hear about. Katie? The clown and the basement?  PAVLICH: Oh, man, I have a traumatic one. My son is bad as clouds at the basement. But I want a goldfish at the fair, and you know when you win a goldfish when you're a kid, and your parents are like, oh, now we have to take care of the stupid goldfish.  And my brother poured all the food into the goldfish bowl, and I brought it to my parents, like do something it's going to eat itself and die. And they're like, oh, we know, we'll take it to the pond. It's going to be set free and live a life on the pond. And then later, like 10 years later, I'm like, you could have just put it in a different bowl, but you got rid of it.  GUTFELD: Too easy. Juan, what's your -- if you're going back ways, Juan, memory.  WILLIAMS: Well, I think -- I think I remember being on a school bus and I was the last kid to be left -- lead off in a snowstorm and the bus driver gave me hot chocolate. And I just threw it right up. I just couldn't handle a hot chocolate that long. It was embarrassing, Greg.  GUTFELD: I just remember it. I remembered this -- it was really, really, really dark, and all of a sudden it got very, very bright and these hands grabbed my head. Anyway, ""ONE MORE THING"" up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PERINO: It's time now for ""ONE MORE THING."" I'll go first. So I know everyone is trying to stay in shape. Look at Megan Vaughan. She's figured out the way to have some success. This is her 55-pound Husky Cache, and she's been using him to boost her sets. I am impressed with the hop. I have to tell you, she is really in ferocious shape. I gave this a shot with Jasper today. Now, he's 72 pounds. He's 72 pounds.  WATTERS: Oh, my gosh.  WILLIAMS: Wow.  PERINO: That's was as much as I can do.  WATTERS: Lower, lower.  PERINO: All right, Greg, you're next.  GUTFELD: Hey, I just -- people keep asking about this shirt. It's not for sale because Jerry from the Misfits, very wise man, does not want to make money off this. But I might be able to get one for you Katie if you're nice. All right, ""THE GREG GUTFELD SHOW"" --  PAVLICH: I would love one. I'll wear it next time.  GUTFELD: -- tomorrow night. 10:00 p.m. April 18th. You got Mike Baker. You got Tom Shillue. You got Kat Timpf. You got Tyrus. It's going to be a hell of a show. Tune in. That's it. I'm yelling.  PAVLICH: All right, Jesse.  WATTERS: All right, let's go to Jesse's hair news. OK, so not everybody -- wow, not everybody has a great wife like Greg's who can cut their hair for them. So people are taking matters into their own hands literally. Look at this farmer giving yourself a trim with sheep shears. He does look like Robert De Niro. Sheep shears, everybody. Look at that. He looks great.  You know what else looks great? ""WATTERS' WORLD"" Saturday night 8:00 p.m. Eastern. We have a real-life virus hunter. He is a virus hunter. That's his job. He literally hunts viruses for living all over the world, so check it out.  GUTFELD: Virus Hunter Biden.  PERINO: Juan, you're next.  WATTERS: That's right. He's in Ukraine.  PERINO: Go ahead, Juan.  WILLIAMS: There's no business like show business, even during the coronavirus shutdown. So take a look at this actress in LA trying to keep her voice and acting chops going. Take a look.  That's Mary Neely and she's playing both the male and female parts Mary Neely, 29 out of Los Angeles. She did Phantom of the Opera, Wicked, Little Shop of Horrors. Miss Neely, you deserve a standing ovation for entertaining us off.  PERINO: Katie I've got 25 seconds for you.  PAVLICH: OK, real quickly. Yes, Arizona Game and Fish releases an awesome photo of an eagle in a swirl cactus in Arizona. And this has not happened since 1937. You could see the Eagles there with little eaglets, so it's awesome.  PERINO: That was a neat photo.  Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

21,FOX," This is a rush transcript from ""The Five” April 16, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everyone. I am Juan Williams, along with Dana Perino, Jesse Watters, Greg Gutfeld, and Katie Pavlich. It is 5:00 in New York City, and this is The Five. President Trump to outline brand new guidelines for reopening a nation under lockdown, he's set for a major news conference just one hour from now, the theme, opening up America again.  Officials say the guidelines won't be one-size-fits-all. Instead, they will be data-driven, tailored for each individual state focusing on a governor- led approach, the president's medical advisors, Birx, Fauci and Redfield, all signing off on the guidelines. That news comes as a group of seven Midwestern governors have announced a partnership to reopen their regional economy.  Meanwhile, the economy getting pummelled by a brutal new jobs report today, more than five million Americans filing for benefits just last week. That means over 22 million jobs have been lost in the past month, the president pledging to restore the economy back at full speed.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: -- also be leading a call with elected officials who will consult with my administration as we work to restore our economy to full speed. And we really think with all of the stimulus and all of the pent-up demand, we're going to have an economy that really comes back quickly. And would like to see it more than match what we had before.  What we had before was a miracle. And we think this is going to be even more than a miracle. We are going to do it because we have the greatest people in the world.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: Dana, I was curious about what you thought about reopening. Given that we don't have a rigorous testing regime in place at the moment, what are you thinking about this?  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, I think if you look back even -- it's Thursday. So I think it was Monday that there was a lot of sort of discussion and debate about who has the authority to reopen the economy. The president, the governors, etcetera. And what you see by Thursday is that the governors are working well in coordination and conjunction with the federal government.  And to the president of the United States is giving them really good guidelines and guidance in saying here's what we suggest. We will be here to help you if you need it. And the testing thing, I'm going to set that aside just for a moment, because I think it's a little bit separate. I think these regional packs that you will see that are bipartisan, they are happening on the west coast and now in the Midwest and you have one in the northeast.  I think that those make a lot more sense, and they are trying to do a one- size-fits-all approach. So I think all of that shows that people can start to, you know, lift their gaze a little bit and see that there is going to be light at the end of the tunnel, and that they are not going to be under some one-size-fits-all approach, because we all know that doesn't make sense and that that won't happen.  On the jobs numbers, I just wanted to mention, you know, 22 million people filing for unemployment. That is overwhelming, right? And you have to think that each of those people has a family. So you extrapolate that out. And it's millions of people who are impacted by this economically. And I think it's atrocious that you have the Democrats who are resisting refilling the small business loan fund.  It is out of money as of yesterday, out of money. So they're not even back in session until next Monday. Think of how many days that is as a small business person. You didn't get your loan. And how long those five days are going to feel for you until Congress figures out a way to get past this impasse and get it done? That is really should be our absolute priority.  And the president, I think if he put his shoulder behind it and push them, he should try to get this done.  WILLIAMS: Right. I think they're going to have to negotiate and do so urgently. Greg, I wanted to come back to this whole notion of reopening, because so much of it has to do with trust. That you can say things will reopen, but for you and me, are we going to, like, get back, you know, to a restaurant or get on a plane, or decide we are going to stay at a hotel if we are not quite sure in our hearts that we are safe?  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Yeah, I mean, it's -- I go back to what I said before. I think we are willing at this point to take that risk, because we kind of -- we all kind of like getting that feeling. That, like, you know what, we are doing the best we can. But right now, maybe it's time we start -- you know, as Dana would say, lifting our gaze.  I've never heard that before. It's very nice. But we have got to leave the vulnerable at home. If the vulnerable -- the older people with underlying conditions, if they are at home, the younger, the healthier people, the people that -- can go back to work. I do love how all of this is now governor-lead. And it makes me think that Trump just pulled, like, a Tom Sawyer painting the fence stunt.  It's like when he said I am in control and then he said no, no, no, you don't. He said, OK, you guys call the shots. So now, what's interesting is the governors have skin in this game. And it's really important, when you are criticizing the commander in chief or anybody that you have skin in the game, because that changes and alters the way that you criticize, because basically, you could be held responsible.  Lastly, it will be a challenge to tabulate. You can count the deaths by a virus, but you have a hard time counting the casualties of a shut down. Whether it is suicides, failed businesses, hopelessness, like, consequences. A virus is scarier than the unemployment numbers, even though the unemployment numbers could end up killing as many people.  But the problem is we can't count that. It's too amorphous and anonymous. And I think that's always going to be a challenge for a lot of people to not -- they won't be able to see the invisible death.  WILLIAMS: That's a good point. Jesse, let's speak to that point, because I think that you have a situation now where people are saying we want to get back to work. We have got these record-level unemployment figures. But at the same time, if we reopen too quickly, it could damage the economy, because then if there is a second wave, a second peeking in terms of the curve. That will crater the economy once more.  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, it's like when you go underwater and you hold your breath. If you keep holding your breath, you're going to sustain brain damage or you're going to drown. And you can tell this country is ready to stop holding its breath and get above water and get a gasp of air, because if you keep staying underwater, you have already seen depression-level economic jobs losses in just one month alone.  This country's not going to make it to May 1st. And that's why you see some states are going to have to open in phases. From what I understand about the plan, it is a three-phase plan. Before you even start phase one, a state has to demonstrate a two-week downward trajectory on cases. It has to have robust healthcare performance, and it has to have robust testing among those frontline workers.  Only then can you get into phase one. And phase one is just limited amounts of people going back to work. Phase two, you open up bars. You open up restaurants. And that is only with limited capacity seating and social distancing. And they suggest nonessential travel, kind of really be curtailed. Only until phase three, the -- have, you know, schools and camps and things like that and large events, still with certain amounts of social distancing.  Because right now, I don't know, man. You can feel this country getting angry. And it's not just at the Chinese. It's -- they are getting angry at the governors. They are not allowed to go to church. You know, they don't have freedom of association. They can't pursue happiness. This is getting pretty ugly. And we can't take it anymore.  KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS HOST: Yeah.  WILLIAMS: Well, I think you have to understand. We are dealing with a virus. But Katie, speaking to that point again --  WATTERS: I understand, Juan.  WILLIAMS: When you are asking people -- right. When you are asking people to listen to the government to reopen, I think a lot of people are going to say, oh, well, didn't it people say it was just like the flu? Didn't people say it was going to disappear quickly? Why should I listen to them this time?  PAVLICH: I don't think that people are super worried about what we have been through. I think that they want their leaders to make the right decisions so they can get back to work and provide for their families. You know, the protests in Michigan are -- really interesting experiment about what you're probably going to start seeing around the country.  Because as Jesse said, when people feel continually that they are pushed in a corner and that they're continually told that they are not essential, when they are looking at their kids and not stocking their freezer full of $13 Ben (ph) ice cream like Nancy Pelosi is in San Francisco and they're on an even tighter budget than maybe they were before, and they are worried about what the next two months are going to look like for -- look like for their family.  That feels really essential. And it feels just as suffocating and serious and threatening to them and to their livelihood as getting sick from the virus does. And so there has to be a balance with these governors, and not overstepping their bounds, not telling people they can't do things on their own private property, not telling them they can't grow their own food, as the governor in Michigan has effectively done by banning the buying of seeds.  If you overstep those boundaries, you're going to have a revolt. And Americans are smart. They have done very well at being cooperative throughout this process. But there will come a time when they are not willing to trade this non-freedom that they now have, and pushing the rights away for some kind of security that they feel that they have given up already.  WILLIAMS: Katie, do you have any sense of when -- you know, the governor of New York said today, I think it was May 15th or 14th. Do you think that is reasonable?  PAVLICH: I think that the president will probably lay out a plan today. And as Dana said, it will be case by case and region by region. So we will just have to wait and see.  WILLIAMS: All right. Coming up, a shocking report on the possible origins of the Coronavirus, stay tuned to The Five for that important story.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PERINO: We could be one step closer to finding out the origins of COVID- 19. Fox News sources say there is, quote, ""increasing confidence among the U.S. intelligence that the deadly virus escaped from a lab in Wuhan after sloppy handling, as opposed to a nearby wet market, as China originally claimed."" China pushing back, saying there is no direct evidence the lab was involved.  The sources also adding that the World Health Organization helped China cover it all up. Katie, let me go to you first about this development. And I guess it helps. This has sort of been out there. But it helps sort of pin the tail on the donkey here about where this would have come from, and what the important point that it wasn't intentional, apparently.  PAVLICH: Yeah. As far as we know, The Pentagon says that they are still looking into that. But they do say, on the record, that they believe it is natural. Now, Senator Tom Cotton has been floating this theory for months now. And The Washington Post actually called him a conspiracy theory who was peddling something very dangerous.  Well, now, we have State Department cables and also evidence out of China that this is likely what happened. Why would China not allow the CDC into the labs there to take a look at what was going on? Why did they destroy evidence? Why did they get rid of a number of people working in these labs? Did it come from a lab?  And Dana, one thing that I think is going to be the bigger question here moving forward, is are we going to take China seriously when it comes to them stealing our information in America by working in labs here and going back to China. Because it is part of Bret Baier's reporting that said this lab was trying to compete with Americans in terms of the kind of technology in science that we have.  Well, they have been in our universities. Last year, they introduced a bill to try and bar Chinese military scientists from working in American labs. Do you think that that would be something we would not want going on? The visa program for Chinese students is riddled with spies who come here and steal information from PHG programs.  Harvard, that professor was arrested in January who was a top chemist at Harvard who was working with the Wuhan lab. So this is a bigger box of issues that are certainly going to have to be addressed. But I'm not surprised at all that this is where this is going.  PERINO: Juan, there was reporting that our government officials, health officials had raised concerns about this particular lab and the sloppiness of -- by, you know, how the workers there, the scientists there were not following proper protocols. This is going back even a few years ago.  WILLIAMS: Yeah. And so what you have is a situation that's plausible. I think that is your point. I mean, it's -- we have every reason to say this could be the case. And again, to reiterate what Katie just said, it's not that they created it, but that they were sloppy in their handling of a virus, as they were competing with the U.S. to say we can handle viruses and the like.  To my mind, what you get then is a situation where the real and provable sin is that China covered it up. That's what -- it strikes me is that, you know, let's not get away from China -- you know, the fact that they are culpable here for having worsened the situation. And one other point on, I would say, is why are we going after the WHO when we should be going after China?  But finally, none of this, it seems to me, mitigates the idea that our own government was slow to respond, and that we have to deal with, you know, sort of what's right here in front of us at the moment, which is a slow response has put us in a situation where we have been on lockdown and we see these high unemployment numbers.  PERINO: OK. Well, Greg, let me talk about China and what this brought (ph), right? So we were talking about the unemployment numbers. And it's not just here in the United States, of course, all over the world. This is -- there is this huge impact. And what sort of price should China have to pay for that?  GUTFELD: Well, I mean, the lab has one job. It's like the one -- it's like the occupational version of Las Vegas. You know, what happens in the lab, stays in the lab. That's the only thing you're required to do. That's the only thing. If you can't keep that stuff in the lab, then you are not a lab. You are like everybody else, you know?  I'm going to let Juan's little slight go by about how we, you know, how said we weren't prepared or whatever, because that's a bunch of BS, and we have gone over that. The big issue here is that --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: What?  GUTFELD: The media -- the media always labels people as conspiracists when people ask questions that they are too scared to ask, right? They always apply this weird peer pressure on what's acceptable as a question. And that actually causes a delayed response, because nobody wanted to hear about shutting down travel, right?  Nobody wanted to hear about -- talking about Chinese cultural practices that might lead to disease, i.e., the wet market. So the most vital questions that needed to be asked, including the origins of the pandemic, were sacrificed for gossip, chatter, and finger-pointing blame. Oh, we were too late. Oh, we didn't act fast enough.  The problem is, the villain being foreign, just isn't a top media narrative for our press. The media is like every single Law and Order episode. You know, if the villain -- the villain has to be the rich American socialite, or they will kill the script. So they weren't interested in the fact that China was the villain or it came from the lab, because that is a foreign villain.  It isn't Trump or America, which is why Juan had to go back and say our response was slow, because he wasn't content with it being China's fault.  PERINO: Well, there were journalists from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post, Jesse that were kicked out of China for reporting on this. And they were basically told that they had to leave the country.  WATTERS: Yeah. I mean, I had a viral expert on my show last weekend, and he spoke about this theory. And the media said he was a conspiracy theorist. To Greg's point, it's a theory. It's not a conspiracy. And now it looks pretty accurate. He said the Chinese in this lab were conducting such dangerous and risky research on this virus in a city next to 15 million people in a sloppy lab with the bad protocols that the U.S. had to actually pull out of their collaboration.  He says this is gross medical malpractice. It's extremely reckless. And it was made worse by the communist government. Think about it like this way. And I'll speak to Juan on this. Imagine if ExxonMobil was doing some sort of chemical research at a facility and cutting corners in order to save a buck, and the thing got loose and ended up killing tens of thousands of people, and taking a trillion out of the U.S. economy.  And ExxonMobil covered it up, and the Trump administration then covered it up and pushed a propaganda plan to cover it up. And if that was uncovered, ExxonMobil would be bankrupt. They'd be paying billions in settlements. And Donald Trump would be hauled in front of The Hague for war crimes. That's how serious this is.  But everyone's going soft on China, and the media, like, they can't talk about it. Let's be honest about what happened and not be scared to tell the truth.  PERINO: All right. Good talk, guys, good talk. All right, next up on The Five, a plea Joe Biden to form a shadow government in his battle against President Trump. We will talk about it.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: Welcome back. The media is just getting more and more ridiculous with their anti-Trump hatred. Listen to this one MSNBC host to drop all pretense of objectivity and actually give Joe Biden advice on how to counter the president during this crisis.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do they need to do it in a bigger way? What did you just call it? The president's daily clown show, that's his press briefing. Should Joe Biden be counter-programming that? Should he be creating his own shadow government, shadow cabinet, shadow SWAT team, and getting up there at a podium every night and saying, here is the crisis we're in. Here is what we need to do to address this.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: And here is Sleepy Joe's latest attack on Trump's leadership.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: These are people who are frightened and they're looking for leadership. What bothers me, what bothers me so much is the president of the United States doesn't take responsibility. The president of the United States acts like this is not -- nothing is his fault. Nothing is his responsibility.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: All right. Dana, I'm not really sure who that was on MSNBC. I don't think she was a primetime host, because I have never seen her in primetime before. So she shouldn't really be giving that much of an opinion. I guess she is during the day or something. That seems a little out-of-bounds in my opinion. What do you think?  PERINO: Jesse, I actually -- like, regardless of what hour she's on, it's such a bad idea. It is such a bad idea. It's so terrible. I mean, we've just spent a week and a half talking about how there's confusion about whether the federal government or the governors are going to reopen the economy. And now, we all agree. OK, so there is collaboration and the governors help make decisions based on some guidelines you get from the federal government.  Look, I understand that Joe Biden is in a bind. That's bad. But what she is suggesting, one, it is a terrible idea if you are a patriotic American, because you cannot have two presidents at the same time. You have one president at a time. And I'm sorry they're in this predicament where they have to try to campaign during a pandemic, but that's the situation they're in.  This idea is like what I used to do with my sister when I got home from school after I had an after-school snack. I would make her play school with me. And this is like playing government. You don't do this for -- it's like make-believe, and I think would just make terrible, terrible sledding for Joe Biden.  WATTERS: Yes, well, you played school and Gutfeld probably played doctor. What do you think, Greg?  GUTFELD: I think I saw that joke coming like a frisbee in the desert 10 miles away. All right, what I find interesting is that Joe literally is in the shadows. That's what's so funny about her commentary. But here's the thing. Nobody, Joe, Nancy, Chuck, Liz AOC, nobody can answer the question, what would you do differently than Donald Trump? What would you do? When would you start the economy? How would you do it?  They can't -- they can't say it, because they know they have a 50 percent chance of being wrong. So they're petrified of actually raising their hand and going, oh, I have an idea. Let's do it now. They can't. So instead, they're not going to step forward. What they're going to do is they're going to wait for President Trump to flip the switch or the dimmer and any collateral damage that there is, then they will leap forward and they would go ha, we wouldn't have done that. No surrey, we wouldn't have done that. You did that too late or you didn't do enough or you did too much, or you're an autocrat or you didn't take control.  But they will not tell you when they're going to start. They're not going to tell you how they're going to start because they're too scared of being wrong.  WATTERS: You're right, because I think Biden stuck his neck out early on the travel ban and he was dead wrong. Juan, grade Joe Biden's, I guess, performance in this quarantined campaign. Would you give them an A, B, or C, and why would you give them that grade?  WILLIAMS: Well, I think that in Biden's case, it's a matter of getting out in public and not allowing the virus, which has changed the whole campaign landscape definitely for everybody on either side here, and not allowing himself to be pushed out of any spotlight because he's not campaigning.  So what you get is he's now on T.V. more than ever. And of course, he's doing those live streams from his basement in Delaware somewhere. So he's on a lot of T.V., and he has also, as I mentioned, these streaming efforts that are going out, so I think it's gotten much better. In terms, of a grade, I'd say initially, not so good, and now pretty good. But, you know, he's up against President Trump, who has this daily press briefing. That's, you know, as the President likes to say on par with the bachelors finale and Monday Night Football.  I do think that you know, in answering this question though, you've got I think everyone I've met who's run for President thinks they're about to win. And so if you're going to win in this environment, you better have a plan. And I don't think there's any reason that he shouldn't be saying to the American people, here's how I would be dealing with it.  And I think that he's been pretty clear, and I think others have said so as well, we need to do a better job when it comes to testing in this country, providing supplies to our medical workers, making sure that, you know, the bank computers don't get all screwed up when we try to deliver stimulus checks to our workers.  These are legitimate criticisms of this administration. And he's got to be able to say I would do a better job.  WATTERS: Yes, Katie, maybe he could ask Liz Warren to have a little help with the plan. She now wants to be his V.P.  PAVLICH: That is true. But do we really think that Joe Biden is capable of running a shadow government? He can hardly run his own interviews. When he's getting -- he can hardly figure out what it is at this point. There's no way he could start running a shadow government.  And I'm sure that the Communist Party of China would love for Joe Biden to start doing something like that, considering he's been -- lacks on China, he's unsympathetic to them, his son has ties to -- business ties to China which questionably may still be there. I mean, he was against the travel ban and allowing, you know, people going in and out of the country while the virus was spreading around the world.  I mean, I'm sure they would love for him to continue the work of the World Health Organization and covering for China on this issue.  WATTERS: And he still needs to learn how to cough into his elbow. We're going to give him a little suggestion there.  PAVLICH: Exactly.  WATTERS: Coming up next, getting life back to normal. How professional sports could make a comeback during the lockdowns.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PAVLICH: All right, well, as the White House prepares to reopen the economy, the world of professional sports having a similar conversation. Unfortunately, if you live on the West Coast, the mayor of Los Angeles says it's likely that large gatherings like sporting events and concerts will not be allowed until 2021. But there could be other options on the horizon. The NFL has discussed playing an empty or half full stadiums, which aligns with what Dr. Anthony Fauci has been saying on the sports -- at how sports can make a comeback.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: There's a way of doing that. Nobody comes to the stadium, put them in big hotels, you know, wherever you want to play, keep them very well surveilled and namely a surveillance, but have them tested like every week and make sure they don't wind up infecting each other or their family and just let them play the season.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PAVLICH: All right, Jesse, you've been trying to save the football season. What are your thoughts?  WATTERS: Yes, this is a no brainer. I mean, you resume sports immediately. You test everyone, the coaches, the players, and the refs, and then you don't play in front of a crowd. I mean, people need to start gambling again. People need to start watching sports on T.V.  I'm even okay with sports, competing against ""WATTERS WORLD"" on a Saturday night at 8:00. I'm willing to make that sacrifice just for the good of the country. We're talking about golf. You don't touch anybody in golf, tennis, their social distance all the way across the court. I mean, football doesn't start camp until August, racecar driving -- I don't see -- there's no contact there. Let's play baseball.  I think basketball, the worst part, you can get infected is maybe in the locker room. Let's get this thing going.  PAVLICH: Juan, are we ever going to be able to watch a national game together again?  WILLIAMS: Oh, I pray. Oh, Katie, you know, I want it so bad. I got a baseball joint. I think -- you know, I noticed that Mark Zuckerberg, you know, one of our great business leaders in this country says that his company is not going to have any meetings with more than 50 people until June of next year, 2021. So that's a private company that's going to lose money making a decision on his own.  And I think when I think about, you know, going to the game with you or hanging out, I just think boy, I don't -- I wouldn't want to see any of these players get infected and get, you know, hospitalized or die. And I think it would be very painful for all of us as not only just fans but as Americans. So you got to be cautious, but I would love to see a game.  PAVLICH: Yes, me too. Dana, our sports expert here, do you have any analogies for us?  PAVLICH: Well, I do. And my sister is in Denver and a big Denver Broncos fans. They have season tickets. And the other night I was talking to her, I called in the middle of -- I didn't text beforehand. I said, what are you doing? And she said, oh, we're watching this game between the Broncos and some other team from 2009. Why aren't you doing that?  But that's what big sports fans have been doing. They've been going back and rewatching games from before because there's a hunger for it. Plus, just economically, you think of just how many things happen around sports, the tickets and the concessions. And you think then, about the people who are working those concession stands. To me that's why I would love to see everything get back to normal because a lot of people are making their livings and taking care of their families and contributing to society, because they are working in and around sports.  PAVLICH: Yes. And some of the team owners are still paying all those people thankfully and they're turning stadiums into food -- places where people can come for food kitchen. But Greg, what are your thoughts on this, sports fanatic or not?  GUTFELD: Well, I mean, sports is -- I mean, it's just one facet of actually the bigger -- the bigger issue here, and that is any kind of mass gathering, whether it's concerts, comedy shows, comedy clubs, restaurants and bars have people too. We're going to eliminate an entire industry of live events.  I was planning on seeing King Buzzo from the Melvins and Trevor Dunn from Mr. Bungle on their acoustic tour. I probably won't be able to. I have two shows in August. I don't think I'm going to be doing them. But I want to -- I wanted to -- because we're talking about athletes. Athletes are pretty wealthy. People in the media do pretty well.  There are -- bands, bands are not millionaires. They travel in a van. Almost all bands are in a van. They live by the tour. There may be 30 comedians in America that are rich -- that are rich. Most comedians are not rich. Most comedians are sleeping on other people's couches. They look at restaurants and bars with razor-thin margins.  It's easy for people in entertainment to say, let's heed the experts, but these are -- all these people that don't have that luxury, and they're all getting screwed, not just the professional athletes and their 12 bedroom mansions, you know, with our deluxe fridges. Anyway, I'm done.  PAVLICH: Well, Greg, I know that you have a brand new guitar so I'm looking forward to your live YouTube channel for some new songs.  GUTFELD: Bass guitar from the Misfits. Thank you, Jerry.  PAVLICH: There you go. All right, straight ahead, love on lockdown. The terrible breakup trend sweeping America, thanks to Zoom.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: Welcome back. Video conferencing app Zoom is delivering some terrible relationship news to star crossed lovers. It's called Zumping, sounds disgusting, the act of unceremoniously dumping your significant other on the platform so you can socially distance from them forever.  But that's not all the mayhem Zoom has to offer. People are paying a lot of money to get into virtual nightclubs. That sounds pathetic. And as you know, animals are great, so a farm is charging 60 bucks, 65 bucks to invite a llama or goats, oh boy, to your next digital work meeting. That seems pretty interesting, Dana, to have a goat at your meeting.  Is this just another one of those trends, Dana, that board feature editors come up with or do you think this is real?  PERINO: I think the breaking up thing on Zoom is probably real. Imagine -- you know, that I would assume that if you can't see anybody, and you weren't really that into that person in the first place that if you're polite, maybe you would want to do it over Zoom so you could actually have a face to face conversation.  I also love the idea of the innovation of these farmers suggesting that you could have a llama for $65.00 in the background of your Zoom. This is -- this could be a whole new industry.  GUTFELD: Yes. In the background, not the back seat though. We don't go for that sort of thing here. You know, Jessie, as you know, my favorite T.V. show Sex in the City, Carrie was dumped by posted note. Remember that?  WATTERS: No, Greg. I didn't watch Sex in the City.  GUTFELD: You're watching Entourage?  WATTERS: It explains a lot about you. And no, I didn't watch that either, Greg. I watch sports.  GUTFELD: Of course, he did.  WATTERS: And you think -- you think you can just get away without doing a monologue and, like, no one's going to realize what just happened? I want everybody in America to just focus on one thing. Greg, didn't do a monologue today. So what were you doing that you were so busy that you couldn't do a monologue?  GUTFELD: I was doing charity work with you know, with the Orphans, The Orphans.  PERINO: Pictures.  GUTFELD: Juan, do you believe -- do you -- would you Zoom with a llama?  WILLIAMS: Well, you know, I was reading about it for this segment, and it sounds like people think that their comfort animals. You know, it's just fun. I mean, someone should call Jasper. You could get a big job or all of a sudden here. But you know, what are the options? The option if got to break up with someone these days --  PERINO: That's not a bad idea.  WILLIAMS: That's a bad one, OK, OK. But the options these days are texting, video, you know, phone call, and with the coronavirus, I guess the best option would be Zoom. You can't stand on the street corner like six feet apart and scream at them.  GUTFELD: That's true. You know, Katie, hundreds of employees for Zoom live and work in China, the engineers. They -- couldn't be compromised by the Chinese government? And then they could they could listen in on our meetings and see what kind of animals we like, and then perhaps, invade?  PAVLICH: I saw a report that China mixed a monkey and a pig, so that's weird.  GUTFELD: Yes.  PAVLICH: I think that Zumping is better than ghosting, right?  GUTFELD: Yes.  PAVLICH: Isn't Zumping better than ghosting and just leaving someone hanging? I mean, I don't know. That's probably good.  PERINO: Yes, I think so.  PAVLICH: It's not so bad.  GUTFELD: Yes, I guess we'll end it there, some hard-hitting news. All right, ""ONE MORE THING"" is up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WILLIAMS: Oh happiness. THE FIVE gets to do ""ONE MORE THING"" today. Let me kick it off with a question. How do you get to Sesame Street? Well, we can't tell you because everyone is staying home due to the coronavirus, and that's also the case on Sesame Street. Take a look at how they're dealing with being unable to get together with their neighborhood friends.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Elmo knows it can be hard to be away from your friends, so Elmo's mommy and daddy are helping Elmo set up a video playdate.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, look, look, I can make myself look like a bunny rabbit.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: Those tapes came from Sesame Street special that aired this week on how children are dealing with being at home and with the fear that they feel surrounding the virus. In addition, Elmo, Cookie Monster, Grover, we're joined by celebrities Lin-Manuel Miranda, Tracee Ellis, and Anne Hathaway.  This is another example, folks, of Americans helping each other as we get through this crisis together. Way to go USA. Greg, you're up.  GUTFELD: All right, let's do this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Animals are great. Animals are great. Animals are great.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: You know, we got two this time because we're piling up on them. And these are a special food edition. First one, look at this poor dog just watching this groundhog eating a slice of pizza. He's social distancing. There's a pane of glass between him. Life is so unfair. Look at that groundhog taunting him. Oh, I'm hungry now for pizza and a groundhog. Groundhog pizza would be delicious.  Anyway, here's another one. This is a what happens when you fill a cup full of whipped cream. This fella shows up. There he is. Let's see that again. You fill up that cup and what happens? What happens? There it is. Yes. Anyway, I'm done.  WILLIAMS: Jesse, your ""ONE MORE THING.""  WATTERS: Well, my ""ONE MORE THING"" has no redeeming value so my mom is going to be very angry, but let's just run it anyway. Here we go. You know those roundabouts that they have mostly in Europe? This guy in Poland, he couldn't figure it out, just drove right through it. It's not a Polish joke, it just happened to be in Poland.  The guy is fine. I like showing crazy video. He's not injured. He's recovering at the hospital. But that's one way to do a roundabout, probably not the smartest way but whatever.  WILLIAMS: Wow. Dana, ""ONE MORE THING.""  PERINO: I loved yours, Juan. I love Sesame Street. I love -- I loved everybody's today and Greg's and Jesse's. All right, I want to say happy birthday to my dad, Leo Perino. Big birthday today, so Happy birthday to you out in Denver. And also I've been dying to show you this ""ONE MORE THING.""  So there's this Texas couple, and they're using the hit show Tiger King to have a little fun. So they have a question right there on their door and it says did Carol Baskin kill her husband? Yes or no? And then the Amazon delivery people decide whether they're voting yes or no. So far, it's a big yes, big yes. That's the Tim and Agata Scott out there in Texas.  WILLIAMS: Katie, you're up.  PAVLICH: OK, so Jeremy Tuck did not let Atlanta stay at home order prevent him from taking his family to this kind of restaurant. Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What's up?  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PAVLICH: All right, so Jeremy's two sons both love hibachi and they go for their birthdays.  Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Well, the big orange meanie strikes again! ""I'm instructing my administration to halt funding of the World Health Organization while a review is conducted to assess the World Health Organization's role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus,"" President Trump announced at a Tuesday press conference. ""Had the WHO done its job to get medical experts into China to objectively assess the situation on the ground and to call out China's lack of transparency, the outbreak could have been contained at its source with very little death."" As if on cue, the media spewed. LEE EDWARDS: CHINA'S CORONAVIRUS LIES NOT THE FIRST FROM ITS COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT ""This is an attempt by the president to steer you away from his own actions,"" CNN's John King said. The network's Jim Acosta chimed in, ""If you go through the scapegoats that he’s blamed for this coronavirus pandemic, the WHO, members of the news media, Democrats in Congress."" It's a reaction we've come to expect from the children in the room, none of whom cared much about the pandemic because they were too busy smoking the crack pipe of impeachment. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Are you surprised by Trump's actions? Are you like the media, in which every day is the first day of Trump's presidency? No. You get it. Trump's strategy, from day one, has been based on incentives. He asks how can we expect the WHO to do better if it's going to get our millions anyway. The WHO is like everything in Trump's orbit. He's going to kick its tires, demand oversight, threaten to pull out. Nothing is off-limits, especially an organization notorious for abuse. Trump just spanked its leadership, which spent lavishly on travel just to be China's mouthpiece. If their house isn't in order, why are we paying their rent? It's a good question, one the media won't ask. Of course, they pretend this is the end of the process when it's really the start. Trump is shaking the box to see what happens next. It's not new. And it works. This is why, in endorsing former Vice President Joe Biden, President Obama spent 12 minutes saying nothing. The endorsement hinged on personality: Trump is mean. But Joe is nice. Unless your name is Tara. The problem with Barack's endorsement? The proof! Does the stock market crash when Trump reams Acosta? Does unemployment rise when Trump invents new nicknames? Nope. All Obama had was a complaint as gray as he is. Yeah, we get it. Mr. Trump is mean. But he's mean on our behalf. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And the media implode because Trump dares to demand competence from people soaking us for millions.

23,FOX,"President Trump defends early virus actions during fiery press briefing. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. Monday’s White House briefing was more like a spanking. First, after the press spent weeks concocting a fantasy rift between President Trump and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the doc showed up to end that dream. ""The first and only time that Dr. [Deborah] Birx and I went in and formally made a recommendation to the president, to actually have a, quote, shutdown, in the sense of ... strong mitigation, we discussed it. Obviously, there would be concern by some that, in fact, that might have some negative consequences. Nonetheless, the president listened to the recommendation and went to the mitigation."" GUTFELD ON THE 'YOU SHOULD'VE ACTED SOONER' MEDIA CHORUS So Trump took the experts’ advice the moment it was offered. How did the media respond? Did they think, ""Wow, we were wrong to waste America's time with stupid high school cafeteria gossip?"" No, they acted like a baby losing its favorite toy. ""Are you doing this voluntarily? Or did the president or vice president ask you to do that?"" CBS' Paula Reid asked Fauci. He responded, ""No ... everything I do is voluntary. Please, don't even imply that."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Yes, it finally happened. Even the calmest guy in the room hates the media as much as everyone else does. Note to media: when Fauci thinks you suck, that's a real diagnosis. Take two months off and don't call us in the morning. After weeks of the media pretending they were on top of the virus while claiming Trump had blood on his hands, what did Trump do? What any old TV pro would do. He dropped a montage to show how wrong the media was. It included Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying, ""His team is on it. They’ve been responsive, late at night, early in the morning. And they’ve thus far been doing everything they can do, and I want to say thank you."" The montage was a media trick that only the media is allowed to pull. So you know it pissed them off. How dare he use their own words against them! That's propaganda. In the briefing room and on Twitter, their incontinent outrage spilled onto their screens and into CNN's sweaty headlines. You could almost see the steam coming out of Jeff Zucker's ears. And why? Because only the media has the power to destroy your reputation. But don't you dare turn the tables on them. Which Trump did. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump also mentioned that we have a lot of extra ventilators. Maybe we should drop them off for the next briefing.

On Saturday, The New York Times published a piece that once again hit President Trump for not being “quick” to respond to the virus. It was written by six journalists, all of whom could have, or should have, done something sooner, but didn't. But alas, the people who keep saying Trump “should have done something sooner"" never say that to the guilty party. MICHAEL GOODWIN: CORONAVIRUS PARTISANSHIP — DEMOCRATS WANT TO INVESTIGATE TRUMP AMID PANDEMIC Like the Times itself, which tweeted this on Jan. 9, “There’s no evidence that the virus, a coronavirus, is readily spread by humans, [oops!] and it has not been tied to any deaths.[Double oops!] But health officials in China and internationally are watching it carefully."" Not only did the Times dismiss the virus, but it also trusted China would handle it, thus endangering all of us. And we’re supposed to listen to the Times? CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER The fact is that if Trump had done everything possible, the press would’ve screamed  ""autocrat,"" because that's what they were screaming already. They called his travel restrictions -- which saved lives -- racist. They accused his task force of not being ""diverse,"" as if viruses have an HR  department. The only crisis the Times can report on is that Trump is president. And about ""acting too slow"" B.S. --  Our economy keeps the world afloat. I hope we examined the effects of a shutdown before we pulled the trigger. If you didn't, you're an idiot. Or a Times editor. So yeah, we ""could’ve done it sooner” because everything good could be done sooner. But the people saying it now, couldn't be bothered then.

25,FOX,"Biden seeks to win over Sanders supporters with promises on health care, student loan debt; reaction on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" April 10, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino, along with Jesse Watters, Juan Williams, Greg Gutfeld, and Emily Compagno. It's five o'clock in New York City. And this is the five.  President Trump saying there is clear signs of strategy against COVID-19 is saving countless lives giving new hope this Good Friday to a country battered by the deadly virus.  The White House Coronavirus Task Force met earlier today as though global death toll from COVID-19 reaching over 100,000 people. But President Trump says the U.S. is headed to a death toll substantially under 100,000, thanks to an aggressive strategy of social distancing. Here's the president on that.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: They said between 100 and 220,000 lives on the minimum side, and then up to 2.2 million lives if we didn't do anything. But it showed just tremendous resolve by the people of this country, so we'll see what it ends up being, but it looks like we are headed to a number substantially below the 100,000. That would be the low mark.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: Here is the latest now from Dr. Birx as well.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DR. DEBORAH BIRX, WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE COORDINATOR: We are starting to level on the logarithmic phase. It's really about the encouraging signs that we see, but as encouraging as they are, we have not reached the peak. And so, every day we need to continue to do what we did yesterday and the week before, and the week before that. Because that's what in the end is going to take us up across the peak and down the other side.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: And as for reopening the country, the president said this country was made to be open and vibrant. Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: We are going to go back to work and we are going to stay healthy. We are looking at a date, we hope we're going to be able to fulfill a certain date. But we are not doing anything until we know that this country is going to be healthy.  So, we're also setting up a council counsel. A very, very great doctors and business people. We are going to be announcing it on Tuesday. I call it the opening our country task force. Or the opening our country council.  I'm going to have to make a decision and I only hope to God that it's the right decision. But I would say without question it's the biggest decision I have ever had to make. Staying at home leads to death also.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: Jesse, I was thinking about how at beginning of this week, remember we played the clip from the surgeon general, Dr. Adams who said, this coming week was going to be our 9/11, our Pearl Harbor moment, and it has been a very sad week, there's been a lot of deaths.  But as we close the week on this Good Friday, the president, the commander in chief who is also the decider in chief now able to lift his gaze and look out ahead to where do we go from here.  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Watching these press conferences, you kind of live and die by them. It's just kind of your heart rate goes up and it goes down, one day they're very optimistic, and one day it's incredibly sobering.  But you're right. They made some accurate calls. If you think about the president just a couple of weeks ago, he pinpointed Easter as a possible peak day. That's looking like it might be it. People are saying today is the peak day. We heard as you mentioned on Monday they were talking about the week of death.  It's been eye-popping the amount of death that's come out this week. Hopefully, and we can only pray it gets better after this. But it does look according to Birx who is the expert modeler like we are on the downswing. That does not mean that you've gone it out of a speed track. You still got to keep it under the speed limit. And that's what we have to do at least until May 1st.  You know, we talk about and we joke about, you know, Trump only hires the best people, duh, duh, duh, and you kind of smile. But in this case, this task force, these are the best people. Fauci, Birx, Pence, the surgeon general, the FDA leader. You get up there and you listen to them and they really inspire a lot of confidence.  So, the president remains flexible when he wants to open this thing up, and I don't think anybody envies that decision that he has to make. You open it up to you soon, and to get a second wave. You wait too long, and it just kills more jobs and opportunities.  So, I just hope the media can understand what we're all going through and that people can be a little bit more patient, but, you know, Easter, it's going to be a tough time.  PERINO: One of the things that the president did today was forcefully defend the doctors that are on his task force and he was asked a few times about that. Take a listen to this, Juan. We'll get your reaction on the other side.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JIM ACOSTA, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Your doctors who are gathered here seem to be in doubt as to whether or not the country can reopen on May the 1st. If they come to you before May the 1st and say the country is not ready, or huge parts of the country are not ready to open on May the 1st, will you listen to them?  TRUMP: I listen to them about everything. I think (AUDIO GAP) I said to Fauci, why don't you move to New York and run against AOC, you will win easily. So, he decided that he is not going to do that. OK. I kid. You know that.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: Juan, one of the things the president did there, he was not only defending the doctors, but it showed that he has developed quite a personal and strong relationship with them and he has relied on them and he is backing them up.  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: I hope so, and I think he said very clearly, it's going to be the biggest decision of his life. To me, the idea that he is focused on the difficulty, the cost, risk, benefit analysis is so important as opposed to simply the political analysis, or the stock market analysis.  You know, I think, Dana, if this is a matter of the left/right divide and the left is saying, let's go slow, and the right is saying no, we need to open more quickly, I think then it becomes more, you know, of the old polarized politics in America, and I think it leads us down a bad path, because if half of the country says I'm listening, and half of the country says I'm not listening, I'm not going to practice social distancing, I'm not going to be aggressive about washing hands and all the rest, I think it sinks us all.  So, we've got to come together on this one. We've got to be united as Americans, --  PERINO: Yes.  WILLIAMS: -- and I think we've got to come to an understanding and sort of a consensus as to the best path. And I think the president today is saying that he wants to lead to that kind of consensus about the best path for us -  PERINO: Without a doubt.  WILLIAMS: -- with regard to any ideological divide.  PERINO: And Greg, why don't you pick up from there about some of the ideas that the president put forward. You talk to the other day about something that you thought would be good for restaurants, and he mentioned it today.  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Yes. I mean, there's a lot of -- he clearly watches The Five, because he talks about a new task force, about the tax deduction for entertainment. But I think the point that unites all of us is that we've all made mistakes based on the information that was had at the time.  That was either coming from China or coming from the World Health Organization. Information is like mushrooms. There is good information, there is toxic information, and then there is the information that will make you see things.  And I think our entire lives are based on -- are based on evolving information. And in order to get the right information, we have to ask some really serious questions. And sometimes no serious questions, we are scared to ask, because people will come after you if you talk about, you know, shutting down borders, they will call you racist.  If you said -- if you say, should we, what are the number of cases are we willing to risk in order to restart the community? They might call you a murderer. If you start talking about risk factors like obesity, they will say, are you criticizing a certain behavior and linking it to some kind of race? These are things that the media does.  PERINO: That happen today in the briefing.  GUTFELD: That's my point. So, my point is, information in America is often stymied by the media, and you do see that in South Korea. At South Korea, you know, they -- they contact traced. They quarantine. They get the stuff done.  So, I think -- I think what we have to do is we have to learn that it is OK to change and evolve based on information. And I just have one more thing, well, no, I'll save it for later.  PERINO: OK. Let me ask Emily, if we can, in the control room if you can pull up number two, because she has been talking a lot about restaurants and businesses and what they are going through. And the president talked a little bit about a possible solution. Take a listen here, Emily.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You reopen the country --  (CROSSTALK)  TRUMP: We have to help our workers enter small businesses. We have to help our restaurants. We have to help -- we have to help our restaurants. I think deductibility will be great for entertainment, restaurants, all of that.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: Emily, any thoughts on that today?  EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS HOST: I think that's a great step forward, and it's great that yes, he is either listening to us or others that have the same thoughts and ideas. And just to address anther challenge right now that small business owners and operators are facing, banks.  Large and small right now are having to close their application acceptance, because they are absolutely inundated with underwriting. How can the federal government not exclude unaffected taxpayers from this application process?  Because of course the banks are going to avoid discrimination. Right? They are going to avoid discriminating, so it ties their hands. They can't choose a needy or borrower over one that applied first. And likely, the ones that applied first are those that didn't have that thinned-out workforce and have the stuff to apply.  And I want to address something that Greg, the appeal that Greg has been making to those that on the other side of this can help stimulate and support the economy. And I want to echo it.  As we navigate this greater demand on our government, I think it's important to manage expectations that there is not going to be a great recovery to look forward to.  Pandemics are not like wars. There is no loss of machines and infrastructure to rebuild. And following wars, there are higher real interest rates, right? There's a growing economy that we have to control, but after pandemics, the economy is sluggish.  There are lower rates, because people are afraid and have a tendency to save. There is no shortage of capital that we have to pump up right after. And for all of those family, the small businesses, that are families who have experience all of this unemployment, the millions of Americans or a huge loss in revenue and income, no matter their positive intention, they will be disinclined to consume. They will want to save, because this whole thing has been really traumatic.  And so, I think, you know, it's a collective trauma we have all been going through. And as Peter Atwater said, you don't recover from trauma, you adapt to it. So, I think moving forward, those that can support the economy absolutely have to. Because the rest of us, there is a lot of shared trauma that results in reduced bandwidth in this collective stress.  PERINO: So well said, Emily. Thank you so much. We're going to keep going.  Coming up next, President Trump teases an announcement on funding for the World Health Organization as Republican lawmakers slam that agency amid the COVID-19 pandemic. We'll tell you more.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WATTERS: Congress is sounding the alarm on the World Health Organization's failed COVID-19 response, and its troubling ties to China. The agency's embattle director is coming under major fire, facing new pressure from lawmakers to testify before Congress and explain his relationship with the communist regime.  The WHO has repeatedly praised China's transparency despite Beijing's attempt to cover up the crisis. Here is President Trump on his threat to cut the funding.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: Over the years many years we have been paying them from 300 to 500, and even more million dollars a year. China has been paying them less than 40, and they are very, very, China-centric as I said during the weeks. China centric.  China always seems to get the better of the argument, and I don't like that. We are going to be talking about that next week in great detail. We are looking at it very, very closely.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: So, Dana, one of the things I found out was the relationship between China and Ethiopia, the country where Dr. Tedros, the chair of the WHO came from.  PERINO: Comes from.  WATTERS: China groomed this guy and China has been grooming Ethiopia almost like a colonial power dynamic for many, many years. Billion-dollar trade, billion-dollar investments and infrastructure and all sorts of deals, and they really wine and dine this guy. He was their top pick. America didn't want this guy. He was China's top pick. They got him and it paid off.  PERINO: So, you're about to hear the train, by the way. Just so you know, it's not my stomach.  WATTERS: Cho-choo.  PERINO: So, you can actually go around the world right now, because of China's aggressive investments into this Belt and Road initiative, you can find people from all over the world who are basically in China's back pocket.  Now Dr. Tedros had been praised in the past by somebody like Dr. Fauci, so they've known each other for years, maybe there is not a lot to see here, but it is suspicious, and especially because you looked back to those cholera epidemics that you mentioned the other day, Jesse, that happen in Ethiopia, and there are questions about that. And a friend of mine who is former intelligence told me that he is super suspicious of all of this.  I think that the president is a little bit like the boss who calls you on a Friday and says, make sure you come to my office at 10 a.m. Monday, I have something really important for you to talk about and then you worry about it all weekend.  Because what the president did right before the clip that he showed, is he said we're thinking about this, and next week we're going to make an announcement. And next week we're going to talk about what we are going to do with the funding for the WHO. And you just know that that is going to ruin their weekend. And they are going to be worried about it all week.  Here's one thing I would recommend. I think the you look at a global pandemic and you realize it's super important to have something like the World Health Organization so they were all communicating with each other, stamping things out as soon as they involve.  But we can't just be involved with the money, we have to have a much more heavy hand involvement with western societies and the United States. So, I wouldn't necessarily cut back the funding. I would push ahead and make sure the United States has more influence.  WATTERS: Juan, what would you do if you were in charge? Because the WHO is saying things that weren't just scientific. They're saying masks don't work, travel bans don't work. These things are not contagious. I mean, they're the World Health Organization, what do you do?  WILLIAMS: Well, I mean, I think first of all you don't want to politicize a pandemic. And I think WHO plays an important role as we are trying to get an international cooperation in dealing with this. We can't stop at one corner and pretend, you know, it' over because if you have it all over the world, Jesse, you got to deal with it all over the world. And that's why you need a World Health Organization.  I do think that China told lies. And I think that in some cases they lied to the WHO, and the WHO then echoed those lies. So, do I blame the WHO, to some extent, yes, but most of all I blame China.  And when you think about the WHO and the role that it performed, you know, I think things like the use of masks, even our experts here in the U.S. have changed their position on it.  But the WHO said very clearly when they declared there was a global pandemic, we, you know, in this country, our president was saying, we can handle this, we got this under control. So, you see, I think there is all kinds of finger-pointing and blame games. As I've said to you on other topics, I'm not sure this is helpful as we try to come to terms with things.  In the political arena, though, I think that you have people who want to point fingers and blame the WHO. I think they should may be, you know, ng you know what, go after China if you want to. China fortunately has so much of our debt and control so much of our manufacturing --  WATTERS: Yes.  WILLIAMS: -- take a look at your iPhone. So, it's hard to go after China.  WATTERS: Yes.  WILLIAMS: Maybe easier to pick on the WHO but this is not the right time to do it.  WATTERS: Right. I mean, I believe both are culpable, but I would agree that China is more culpable. And Lindsey Graham agrees. Let's play Lindsey, and then you can react, Mr. Gutfeld.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): The first thing I want to do is get the United States Senate on the record where we don't blame Trump, we blame China. The Chinese government is responsible for 16,000 American deaths, and 17 million Americans being unemployed. It's the Chinese government and the way they behaved that led to this pandemic.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Well, you know, I'm not interested that much in the blame component. I'm interested in the relationship between China and the World Health Organization, and then how we can modify it so it serves our needs.  PERINO: Right.  GUTFELD: We know that essentially China is like a big business, and the World Health Organization is there press office. And so, they are the public relation flacks who smoothed over the oil spill, right, or the accidental food poisoning, or the escaped virus, right?  They are those catastrophic public relations agencies that are working on behalf of China. Now we have no reason to doubt what they were doing, because, hey, it's the World Health Organization, anything with the world as a prefix has to be good, right?  World music, can't stand it. Anyway, so the solution for me, and again, it has nothing to do with picking on them. It's a construct -- constructive solution is to take all the involuntary funding. I think there's -- I don't know how much it is. I know there is voluntary funding from private people. But take the other, give it to the people that are suffering, the small business.  So, because the people that are being harmed by China and by relationship who, you know, you can sue China or you can just take that money and funnel it to America's bar tab. Because that's what this is about.  We need to pay America's bar tab when people come back so that they spend more money. That doesn't assign any blame, it just shifts some of the money over to the victims who could really use it. That's my solution.  WATTERS: Emily, do you like the idea of WHO picking up our bar tab?  COMPAGNO: Yes. I like the idea of anyone picking up our bar tab. I think that's great. I think the question that President Trump and the other world leaders are facing right now is how do we compel China ever to play by the same rules as everybody else?  This is only one example of like 50 concurrent elements right now. Where their history of subversion and a lack of transparency has resulted in global negative results. And given their current issues with environment and trade and wildlife, it's not as if this might not happen in the future again.  And so, I think moving forward, there needs to be some type of global consensus where there is a zero tolerance for them. So at least now there is sort of a conversation about it.  WATTERS: Yes, well, apparently last night Peter Navarro on Martha's show said that the United Nations had about 15 different sub-agencies like the WHO and China controls five out of the 15.  PERINO: Yes.  WATTERS: So, we have to figure out a way to wrestle those away.  COMPAGNO: Exactly.  WATTERS: All right. Coming up, time to buckle up for the 2020 election. We've got some shocking new polls to tell you about. Plus, Joe Biden's attempt at wooing Bernie Sanders supporters, next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WILLIAMS: Welcome back. Can Joe Biden, the Democrats' presumptive nominee for president bring his party together in time for the November election? The former V.P. is doing his best to woo Bernie Sanders supporters now that Sanders has gotten out or suspended his campaign.  What we see now is that Biden is coming out with a plan to expand Medicare eligibility, and secondly, to forgive some student loan debts. Both ideas put forward by Sanders. Biden says he'll do these things if he's elected president. And Biden better at quickly because a new poll from Fox News shows President Trump virtually tied with Biden at 42 percent support apiece.  Jessie, let me come to you and ask, given what Joe Biden is doing is a little bit of a surprise to me because politicians after the primaries, they usually move to the center, but now we see Joe Biden moving to the left. How do you interpret this?  WATTERS: I think it's weak and I think you're dead-on, Juan. I think this is too late. Bernie Bros won a revolution, and anything short of revolution is just not going to be good enough for the Bernie Bros. You saw Bernie on stage. Anybody to the right of Bernie, he basically said was like a capitalist pig that was you know, business as usual.  So I don't think that's going to do Biden any good to flirt with the Bernie Bros are making these types of overtures. They have a big problem. His base is cracked. He's probably going to lose maybe 10 to 15 percent of the Bernie Bros. And the fact that a Fox News poll which hasn't been that favorable to President Trump has the President tied with Joe Biden this far out in a presidential election, I think it's very good news for the President.  WILLIAMS: Greg, is there anything, anything that Joe Biden can do to really pull in the Bernie Bros because the hardcore supporters -- I think a lot of people are not necessarily hardcore on the Bernie side, but let's talk about the hardcore folks. What could Joe Biden do to say to them jump on the bandwagon?  GUTFELD: He should wear a Bernie mask, because that's kind of what he's doing right now. If I -- if I were Trump, I would say Joe's just Bernie in a Joe mask. And then -- and then say like, do you remember April and March 2020? We add lines for food, empty shelves, high unemployment, that's the Democratic Party, because that's how socialism looks. You got a taste for it. That's what you're going to get if you elect Joe.  Hey -- but anyway, because it's your birthday, Juan. I have -- I have a special talking point, especially for you. The big problem --  WILLIAMS: OK.  GUTFELD: The big problem with Joe is that he could not pull off a presser like today. Trump's brain is especially agile and swift and capable. And when you watch that, you put Joe in that place, and you know that he gets easily frustrated over simple sentences.  So, here's my talking point. The question on everyone's mind right now is could President Trump be the most caring president we've ever had in the history of the country? Because the evidence is clear. He is willing to put his economic achievements in jeopardy to save lives. He's willing to pay up his own business to save lives. He's willing to lose reelection to save lives.  Put that on top of his revulsion over military intervention and his deep desire to get troops out of harm's way, this guy makes Florence Nightingale look like Lizzie Borden. That's my birthday talking point to Juan.  WATTERS: Wow. Happy Birthday, Juan.  WILLIAMS: That was like the icing on top of the cake. Yes, really. That was too sleek. Man, I'm going to tell my mom I can only eat so much.  GUTFELD: I wrote it for you, Juan. I wrote it for you because I knew you would love it.  WILLIAMS: I appreciate it. It was -- it's so rich. It's so rich, you know. So Dana, one of the -- one of the things that we talked about here is, you know, the President has clearly been trying to foment the fighting, the kind of internal dissension among Democrats. But I just think to myself, if you're on the -- on the Joe Biden camp, and you say to the Biden -- to the Bernie Sanders supporters, hey, who do you want to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg? Well, I just shocked them and say, sorry, I was just playing around. Of course, I'm going to vote for Joe Biden.  PERINO: Well, President Trump is not just a commander in chief and the decider in chief, he's the instigator in chief and he's really good at it. Like Jesse was saying yesterday, how he used to do at the lunch table, get people to fight. I mean, it's good to get your enemy to like fight amongst ourselves. It's like really -- that's really good.  But here -- you know to the victor should go the spoils, but that's only for a confident conqueror. And Joe Biden is a weak nominee. He's hobbled. And now he's in the middle of trying to deal with this during a pandemic. And instead of being victorious, and as you said, like moved to the center and say, I can be the president for all Americans, he's putting out policy proposals that probably would have helped him in New Hampshire primary, not now. And I don't understand what their strategy is. Maybe they'll come out one day and try to tell us.  WILLIAMS: Well, Emily, I mean, I think that the strategy is emerging. I think they do. Would you give these folks time because I think that there's a political process taking place in which Biden is slowly trying to not only woo some of Sanders supporters, but woo Sanders himself? Is that a fair assessment?  COMPAGNO: It might be. And I think the question is whether he has enough time to work this miracle. And you know, I think short of ventriloquism, this delicate balancing act is not going to work. I don't think he can have it both ways. And what I mean by that is right now we see him capitulating to those Bernie Bros, right? He's talking about climate policy, income inequality, college and university tuition forgiveness, all of that stuff that they love.  But at the same time, he can't have his cake and eat it too, with the independence and the moderates that he needs to actually win the general election. And so moving forward, he needs to make that call is what would actually benefit him. Because at the end of the day, as Jesse pointed out, those Bernie Bros care about authenticity.  So if he chooses another establishment V.P. candidate and then thinks that just by talking that talk, he will have them on his side will be sorely disappointed.  WILLIAMS: All right, don't go anywhere. The ""FASTEST SEVEN"" is up next on THE FIVE.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  COMPAGNO: A stunning revelation for many couples during the Age of the Coronavirus. 46 percent are reporting that they had no clue what their partner did for a living until they were in isolation together. All right, Greg, I'm going to start with you. Did you know what Elena did? Did she know what you did? I think it's pretty obvious.  GUTFELD: Here's what I've learned about my wife. She eats a lot of vegetables all the time. She's just non-stop cooking and eating vegetables, and she cleans a lot. She walks around and she cleans a lot. She might -- you know, obviously, I found out that she's a really, really nice person because she might be watching this although I probably doubt it.  But you know, I will say this. It is amazing how they always say it's like a home might be a man's castle or whatever, but the woman runs the joint. And God help you if you question the authority on that, because you'll be dead.  PERINO: Yes, yes.  COMPAGNO: Dana, what do you think about 46 percent --  WATTERS: Greg, you know who she cleans up after? She cleans up after you.  GUTFELD: Yes, it's true. I'm disgusting. I really am. I really am a disgusting human being.  COMPAGNO: Dana, what are your thoughts on this? 46 percent, is that true?  PERINO: Well, here's the thing, because I have the two shows, and I'm doing that Storytime thing, and I have a couple podcasts and do some interviews here and there, I think Peter has a better appreciation that I'm not just goofing around all day, that I'm actually pretty busy.  And I've made a little bit fun of him because he finds the funniest internet memes and will collapse and laughter and I'm like, is that your part-time job finding internet memes? But actually, he's really helping take care of the household, he's done all the grocery shopping for us. So he's doing double duty during this time.  COMPAGNO: And Juan, what are you and Delise like at home? Are you guys taking care of each other during the day?  WILLIAMS: You know what, I just want to echo what Greg said in that the woman runs the house. It's her -- it's her house. You know, and I am interrupting her rhythms because normally I'm in New York. And so, now I'm here, it's like, hey, how do I get these wet leaves out, you know? How do I sweep them out?  I must say this is so curious to me because are these people's spies? Is this like homeland where the kids don't know what the parents do or something? How can -- how can you not know what your spouse -- what your spouse does? That's ridiculous. That's crazy.  COMPAGNO: Jesse, I feel like you are living the like best life for everyone. So you've been talking about how Emma has learned to cook during this time. She launched her own business as a workout instructor during this time. Like, I feel like your whole life is amazing.  WATTERS: Well, like for instance, if I say the wrong thing on this show, and I get fired tomorrow, maybe Emma business is a second stream of income. You know, like a little cushion in case I say a really dumb comment. So there's that.  GUTFELD: There's always that chance. There's always that chance, Jesse. We've got about that.  WATTERS: There's always -- every show.  GUTFELD: 17 minutes left on this one.  PERINO: I'm not there to hold your hand.  WATTERS: I'm counting down. I'm counting the clock.  COMPAGNO: All right guys, don't go anywhere. ""FAN MAIL FRIDAY"" is up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: Yes, let the good times roll. It's ""FAN MAIL FRIDAY."" We're answering your questions. First one from MB W. If this shutdown were to end today, what would be the first thing that you would do, Dana?  PERINO: Get my hair done.  GUTFELD: I suppose, Juan, that's probably what you would do too, get your hair done. Look at mine.  WILLIAMS: Yes, at Dana's.  GUTFELD: Yes.  WILLIAMS: I don't know. You know what, ideally, I'd love to go to a ballgame, you know, I don't know who go with me. I don't know. It's kind of like, I can understand.  WATTERS: Yes, social distancing. Emily?  COMPAGNO: There is an awesome Mexican restaurant near my house that has this huge fun patio and I would head straight there.  GUTFELD: Oh, that sounds so good. Margaritas, no salt. Jesse, what's the first thing you're going to do?  WATTERS: I'm going to go to your house and give you a big hug, Greg.  GUTFELD: I'll be sure to have my robe closed. You know, if the shutdown were to end today, the first thing I would do is call in sick.  WATTERS: Nice.  GUTFELD: Anyway --  WATTERS: Very nice.  GUTFELD: Yes. So this is actually a great question. These are leftover from last week by the way because we keep getting bumped, but this is a great -- so what is the craziest thing you've ordered online during this self- distancing? Emily, I know you've probably ordered something.  COMPAGNO: These fake press-on nails that are like $2.99.  GUTFELD: Juan, press-on nails?  WILLIAMS: I think Emily is going to send me some.  GUTFELD: You don't order -- you don't order --  WILLIAMS: I haven't ordered anything.  GUTFELD: Yes. Oh, man.  WILLIAMS: No, but I got my wife had to order my birthday gift online. That's true.  GUTFELD: Jesse?  WATTERS: I told you guys I got those Bowflex weights, and I got an AB roller, and I got a yoga mat. I would be buffed when I get back.  GUTFELD: Yes, Dana?  PERINO: I don't know if it's weird but I left in New York accidentally this toner that I use for -- like skin toner, so, I ordered that. It's not weird, but it was really important that I get it.  GUTFELD: What -- is it like a lotion or is it a machine?  PERINO: It's a secret sauce. It's a secret sauce.  WATTERS: It's a toner, Greg.  PERINO: Toner is a liquid. It's a liquid.  GUTFELD: My brain is going to a weird place. I spent two days ago -- this is why it's a great question. I spent two days -- two days ago I went online and bought hundreds of dollars' worth of record albums and have almost no memory of it.  PERINO: Cool.  GUTFELD: From Amoeba records and stranded records. And I got the bill in the mail, and they're shipping them and I'm very excited. It was a better story in my head. ""ONE MORE THING"" up next.  PERINO: It's a pretty good story.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PERINO: It is time now for one more thing, Emily.  COMPAGNO: Today it's a very special day, you guys. It is our own Juan Williams' birthday. And Juan, you are such a great friend, you're such a great mentor, and most importantly, it is obvious that you are a wonderful father and grandfather and husband. And we love you. We wish you and celebrate in person. For now, this will have to do. We can't wait to celebrate you on the other side. Happy birthday, my friend.  GUTFELD: Happy birthday, Juan.  WILLIAMS: You are so kind. Thank you, guys. Thanks, Emily.  PERINO: Happy birthday.  WILLIAMS: Appreciate it.  WATTERS: Wait a second, Emily --  PERINO: Juan, you're next.  WILLIAMS: I think it's my turn.  WATTERS: Is Juan your mentor?  COMPAGNO: Yes. And many people's mentor.  WILLIAMS: I try -- I try to be nice to you too, Jesse. Come on.  WATTERS: OK, Juan, your my mentor too.  PERINO: All right, Birthday Boy.  WILLIAMS: All right, so today is National Siblings Day. I'd never heard of it, but it's been celebrated since 1995. So just for the fun of it, we here at the five decided you know what, we're going to show you our siblings. So let's kick it off with my brother and sister Roger and Elena. I'm the baby of the bunch. The lawyer and the banker are 11 and eight years older.  Next up Jesse. Jesse's sister is Elisa. She's a professor at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. And here's Dana and her younger sister Angie. Angie lives in Colorado, has four cats, but she still loves Jasper. And of course, I learned today she loves the Cookie Monster. And here are Emily and her older sisters, Natalie and Julie. Julie is a child psychologist, Natalie, a travel writer.  And finally, we got Greg. Yes. Greg said he had a great picture of his three sisters. Here they are. Yes, indeed. It must have been a very formal event, I think, right Greg?  GUTFELD: Yes, that was -- you know, when you -- when you ask somebody for sibling pictures and you have three sisters, you don't want to do it, because somebody is going to be pissed off at you. So, I just picked penguins. I'm smart.  PERINO: Well, you can see the family resemblance.  GUTFELD: Yes, you can, Dana.  PERINO: Greg, you're next.  GUTFELD: All right, the Greg Gutfeld show tomorrow night April 11th at 10:00 p.m. I got Joey Jones, Pete Hegseth, Kat Timpf, and Tyrus is back. It's going to be a great show. You better watch it. What else are you going to do? Now, let's do this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Animals are great. Animals are great. Animals are great.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: You know, I'm not a fan of animal stunts, but this one even bothers me more. Take a look at this little stunt with this little cat. You'll see what he's doing. The cat will be -- isn't this amazing? Look at that really, really impressive. I got to admit, it's impressive.  But in this era, where people have no toilet paper, what are these people doing with all of these rolls of toilet paper doing tricks with their cat when people have nothing to wipe their bottoms with? This is like a rapper, you know, showing up a wad of bills, you know, in a very poor part of town. I'm very disgusted by this, but I can't stop watching. That's it.  PERINO: That cat can jump.  GUTFELD: Yes.  WATTERS: Animals are great.  GUTFELD: They are.  PERINO: Are you doing your animation?  GUTFELD: No.  PERINO: No. OK, no more animation. All right, Jesse, you're next.  WATTERS: So our friends at Rhoback are doing the right thing. They're donating a lot. And I mean a lot of facial coverings to people fighting COVID-19 on the front lines. And now you can get some of these masks for yourself. It's called the victory mask. And it's kind of generated from the victory gardens that people use to grow to fight food shortages during the World Wars.  And if you go online, you get it for six bucks. They don't even take a profit on that. They just plow that money right back into donating more masks. So go to Rhoback.com and check that out. Also, go to ""WATTERS' WORLD"" Saturday 8:00 p.m. Eastern. We have Dr. Fauci in my world. There he is.  PERINO: That's pretty cool.  WATTERS: What will I ask him?  PERINO: OK, I'll go quickly here. Zack Skidmore, I want you to show you this, Jesse. You didn't even have to buy that Bowflex if you were talented like this guy. He made a gym in his backyard entirely out of wood --  WATTERS: Wow.  PERINO: -- because his gym had close. So he spend about 60 hours putting this all together and who would have guessed his plan worked?  Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC.

26,FOX,"The U.S. may be turning a corner in the coronavirus crisis but you wouldn't know that from the media coverage; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" April 9, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Others are saying stretch it out a little longer. We'll find out very soon. Fox continues now.  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everybody. I'm Jesse Watters, along with Juan Williams, Greg Gutfeld, Dana Perino, and Emily Compagno. It is 5:00 in New York City, and this is The Five. A decade of job growth vanishing in just less than a month, the Coronavirus crisis crushing American workers as pressure mounts to reopen the economy.  The COVID-19 task force will brief the nation very soon. It comes as brutal new numbers show 6.6 million people filed for unemployment last week alone. And at least 10 percent of the workforce is unemployed and now out of the job. A new report says President Trump is planning to announce a second task force to restart the economy as soon as this week. Here is the president on that.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We could do it in phases. We can go to some areas, which you know some areas are much less affected than others. But it would be nice to be able to open with a big bang and open up our country, or certainly most of our country. And I think we are going to do that soon. You look at what's happening. I would say we are ahead of schedule.  Now, we will be sitting down with many different people, making a determination. And those meetings will start taking place fairly soon.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: And here's something the American public doesn't need, more partisan politics. Democrats blocked Mitchell McConnell's clean proposal to give another $250 billion in relief funds to small businesses. The White House expects the current pool of money to run out very soon. Dana, is it Jasper's birthday?  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: It is. He is -- it is Jasper's birthday today. That's true. And he had been -- he has come to The Five every day -- I'm sorry, every year that he had a birthday. And so we wanted to make sure -- oh, we are having a little technical problem behind me. That is a Google screen, in case you were wondering. Anyway, it's Jasper's birthday, just wanted to make sure he had a moment.  He's been pretty good in hanging out with us. To this point, one thing about this is that the Democrats are just asking for more trouble when -- because they didn't want a clean bill. They wanted all these unrelated priorities. Now, some of the things they were asking for, for example, money for hospitals. That might be needed at some point.  But I think that the Congress has shown that they are willing to spend money. They're willing to get together and do this. But unrelated priorities right now are not necessarily a good idea.  WATTERS: You know, Juan, what does it take for the Democrats to stop delaying things? You know, you have these numbers that just show the American workforce has been decimated. And at the same time, you see just more partisanship on Capitol Hill. How does that look?  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, I guess it depends how -- which way you are looking from Jesse, because where I'm looking, I think, wait a second. What the Democrats are proposing is more money for hospitals and the healthcare industry in the hospitals. They are at the frontlines and need more resources right now.  The Democrats are also saying we need to do a better job for American families in terms of -- for example, food stamps. Making sure that we extend those benefits, increase them at a time when, as you pointed out, unemployment is skyrocketing. At a time when the Federal Reserve is saying we're going to put $2 trillion out there, more money for loans for small business.  And the Democrats want more money for small business. They also want an inspector general who is not going to get fired right out the box so he can oversee that this money is not being spent in a partisan matter, but actually going to the American people. So I think that those things are reasonable. And I think if you are saying, at least from my perspective, Jesse, that there's politics blocking it.  It's that they're -- you see Mitchell McConnell just saying, look, give this to the big businesses. And big business will give this to small business. Forget about the hospitals. Forget about the working men and women in the country. That's not right.  WATTERS: Well, I think you know it's not true to say that the Republicans are saying screw you to small businesses and to the working men and women of this country. You don't really believe that. You are just saying that. Greg, when you look at these numbers --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: -- if you are some guy that's in Minnesota, and, you know, they've made your company shutdown, and there are not a lot of people with the virus in Minnesota. It's kind of hard to stomach. I don't know how you get around it.  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, first of all, I don't understand how the media is surprised by these job numbers. This is what happens when you shutdown an economy. So what if we didn't do this and have this historical shutdown to fight a virus? Would it have been worse? I would vote yes. The problem is we don't have a control Earth.  We can't do a side-by-side comparison of what our actions are if we hadn't have done them. So we know now more about this virus and this pandemic than we did before. But we do not know is the impact of the shutdown long term. So my feeling is we need to prep for that unknown. Just like we did for the virus, we need to prep for the outcome, the consequences of this shutdown.  We must to figure out how to reduce the consequences, how to help these small businesses, tax deductions for people. We need the same mentality that we had to fight the virus to deal with this shutdown, because this is now part of that pandemic. This is the consequence. So we need to look ahead about that. It's a great truth.  The worst person to give you advice in life is the person who only sees one variable. That's the friend who says, hey, let's go out and get wasted Tuesday night because he doesn't see the other variables. Like that you have a job in the morning. And you don't want to hangover, and it's irresponsible. That's the kind of people that we need to look at this economy the people who are able to look at the cost benefits of every decision.  To realize that there is going to be a risk that you can mitigate it but you can't eliminate it. You got to look at the disease and death reduction over time, the possibility that it might come back. You need to do random testing. You need to do -- what do you call it, trace -- what do you call it, what's the word I'm looking for -- contact tracing.  PERINO: Contact tracing.  GUTFELD: Contact tracing -- and phases for people when they can start work. So you -- there's always variables. If you just stare at one variable, like, you know, the death rate, and that's it. You're never going to be able to understand how to get back to work.  WATTERS: All right. Well, let's go to Emily Compagno who never was the one to call and say let's go out and get wasted. She would never do that. She was always the one that was --  PERINO: That was me.  WATTERS: So -- yeah, right. Emily Compagno, you know, you spoke really passionately about the restaurant owners the other day. But I think, you know, a lot of Americans, they see these as numbers. But behind the numbers, they are real men and women, families that don't have a job, and don't have income right now, and can't wait to open back up.  EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS HOST: Exactly. Just like my family and our small business that has been really gutted by this. And so speaking a little bit more on that payroll protection program, there's no way that the small businesses, these families, as you pointed out, will be able to meet the payroll forgiveness threshold if social distancing mandates remain after their doors are opened, just like you've said.  Because there will be no revenue revival, and why should the federal government be stipulating how many full-time employees they restore when their revenue streams are being annihilated. And this is what's important for viewers, too, that most of the funds that get paid back via loans are amortized over just 18 months or two years.  So how is an aggressive repayment plan like that sustainable during quarantine, let alone afterward during a period of hopefully growth? And if growth is hindered, that means job creation is hindered. And these industries that you guys mentioned, like, restaurants, Jesse, and hospitality, they've already seen millions of workers laid off.  So what we need in part, like Greg was mentioning specifics, you know, to have allowable funds to include cost of goods for inventory purchased on 30-day terms before foreseeable closures. There are food vendors right now that are sitting on billions of dollars worth of inventory. And like you said, numbers, well, that's good food. That is good food that is being wasted.  Dairy farmers are dumping milk. Farmers are seeing their crops rot. Restaurants can't donate their perishables because of red tape, or they can't afford the labor to deliver it. And the final insult to injury -- I will close with this, is that the government right, just now in terms of regulations and how we think about the future and as Greg, said sort of creating plans or the larger picture of preventing this in the future or addressing it.  Is that, for example, those dairy farmers that are dumping thousands of gallons of milk, they need permits to do so. And OSHA, in its infinite wisdom right now, has been paying surprise visits to these skeleton crews in the hospitality industry to make sure that they comply with regulations. That's not what small businesses need. That's not what families need. They need action.  WATTERS: Yeah. You have to cut back on the regulatory crackdown at a time like this. I think everybody would agree with that. All right, good conversation, the white House Corona task force, they're going to brief in a little bit. But ahead on The Five, it looks like America is turning a corner in this COVID crisis, but you wouldn't know that from the media.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  COMPAGNO: The White House Coronavirus task force is coming up. And there's been some encouraging news this week. One key model forecasting far fewer deaths from Coronavirus than earlier estimates. But we still need to keep up the social distancing across the country to keep that trend going. The media is not making the situation any better with attacks like this on President Trump. Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Tens of thousands of people will die in the country or half -- some of them have already died. More are soon going to die because of Donald Trump's incompetence and lack of leadership.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Here we have a president who is exploiting a national crisis to move forward his own agenda, his own revenge, his own profit.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  COMPAGNO: And it gets worse. NBC's Chris Hayes promoting a conspiracy theory that the Trump administration inflated the death toll projections so the president could take a, quote, ""victory lap"" when they came in much lower. Greg, I want to start with you. You always feel so strongly about the media. And I wanted to ask you. Is there anything that you think the mainstream media will have an appropriate perspective on?  GUTFELD: I think -- you know, I completely understand the political -- the politics. It's a team sport thing. And it's like -- like some viruses, it's incurable. The only thing that bothers me is that the media is so clearly on one side. I would like to change that. It's never going to happen. Acosta asking about whether Trump had investments in Hydroxy, that wasn't - - as if Trump would risk his re-election, his legacy for a couple hundred dollars in stock is just moronic.  But what's even more moronic -- it's not even an Acosta original. He stole that from that the hack buffet, known as -- that dopey duo, Morning Joe. So I think we should start doing contact tracing on really dumb ideas in the media. You know, identifying someone who's been near somebody who has been infected by a dumb idea and then try to trace it back.  So it starts at MSNBC, and then the virus moves to CNN, and then moves back to MSNBC. It keeps going around. And if we could stop it, we could prevent more infections. But one last point. If this pandemic is far less than what we predicted, it is going to create a swirl of un-provable arguments. So we might as well just get used to it.  We're going to have one side saying it's all social distancing. Another one saying that fear was oversold. The projections were ridiculous. People will say that Trump saved lives by shutting down travel. Others will say he put the economy before people. These things are going to go on for the rest of your life. You don't want to get sucked into it because they are almost all un-provable.  COMPAGNO: Dana, I wanted to play a video for you and get your thoughts on it. This is what James Carville had to say -- what Republicans will do to stay in power. Take a look and then we'll get your thoughts.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What I do fear is what you had in Wisconsin, where they try to muck with the election --  (CROSSTALK)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- one of the most awful things I've ever seen in my life. Just the extent they would go to hold onto power. It was all about one Supreme Court seat in Wisconsin. They will kill people to stay in power, literally.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: So you wanted me to react to that. So OK, the Wisconsin thing, I think that clearly there is a lot of criticism that could be thrown that way. I don't know -- why they couldn't have worked it out. I know there was blame to be had on both sides. The Republicans and the legislature, the governor being a Democrat, slow to move. They couldn't work together.  I do think the most ridiculous thing was you had the Speaker of the House - - the leadership of the state legislature, a Republican, in full-on protective gear with a mask doing an interview, telling everybody in Wisconsin that it was perfectly safe to go outside and vote. That I think opened them up to a lot of criticism. And it's not too early to start thinking about what to do in the future.  There are criticisms about mail-in voting, though you have a state like Utah. It's all-mail in. They don't seem to have a problem. Nobody questions it. We can have that debate. And this issue of voter suppression, the Democrats are going to talk about that a lot between now and November. And I think the Republicans have to have a much better answer as to how they are going to try to deal with it, so all of those things are happening.  If I could say one thing about the question that Acosta posed to the president about the funding, it reminded me of -- for eight years, the media would go after Dick Cheney over and over again for investments in Halliburton. He had no investments in Halliburton when he was the vice president. He would not be able to benefit.  And it didn't matter how many times you explain this to them in a very logical way. The media just didn't care. They just continue to try to pummel somebody. But I think if I could be use a sports analogy, this one at $450, if that's the investment, that's what would you call a swing and a miss.  COMPAGNO: Jesse, ABC published a damaging report on President Trump's reaction to this. And then a military official refuted it and they refused to issue a correction. Will we ever see some type of acknowledgment of the responsibility that they've had in shaping that narrative?  WATTERS: Probably not. You didn't see it with Russia. I don't know why you wouldn't see it with this. I mean, if we had today's media during World War II, they would blame FDR for Pearl Harbor instead of the Japanese. They would probably blame the House Republicans at the time. But you see my point. This is China's deal. China lied. The WHO botched this.  The virus, Mother Earth is killing people, not the president. I mean, there's still so much we don't know about this virus. This is an invisible enemy. We shutdown the entire U.S. economy, that wasn't aggressive enough? I mean, they criticize the president for acting too late or not listening to the scientists. Show me in February where Dr. Birx and Fauci said we need to all shelter in place. You can't find it because it didn't happen.  You know how many deaths there were in this country from COVID-19 on March 1st, one. Show me one pundit that spoke on television for the need to have the whole country shelter in place. If you can find that person, I will buy them a round of drinks. But it didn't happen. They were obsessed with Mike Bloomberg at this time. And to Greg's point, you can play with these models and projections however way you want.  You could say Trump saved lives. You could say mitigation works. You could say the models were wrong or the models were updated when new information was put into it. Look at the climate change models. All of them have been wrong. Yet, people are obsessed with the climate change models. I mean, I could play this game all day.  I could say Barack Obama did nothing while the opioid epidemic cost 200,000 American lives, and that's on him. I could say that, but I won't, because I'm a very classy guy.  COMPAGNO: All right. Juan, what are your thoughts on anything you like from whatever everyone said?  WILLIAMS: Well, let me just -- Emily, let me just go back to this business about what happened in Wisconsin. You know, I just thought that was a huge flaw. I think it was an embarrassment for us as an American people. I don't think people should have to choose between staying healthy and, you know, participating in an election.  I thought it was wrong. And, you know, even when there were questions about mail-in voting to the president yesterday, the president said, oh, no. It's terrible. You could see it all in front. And then they said, Mr. President, you voted by mail in the last election in Florida. He said yeah, that's true. I mean, to me, it's just, again, about voter suppression.  So we will come back to that topic. As to the media, well, I think a lot of what we're hearing their, to me, I would put it in the category, Emily, of not helping us to move forward, not, you know, not helping us to progress and get out of this situation. This thing is so serious. I would rather not get hooked up in those kind of trivial finger-pointing, backbiting, backstabbing.  I will say that a non-partisan basis, the fact is that we as a country were slow to respond is specific. The president when he was downplaying the seriousness of it, I think the administration was slow to respond. But let's leave it there. And let's now try to pick up pace and do the things that are necessary to get us in the right place.  Because I think that -- we don't -- there's no need for us to get involved in harsh conspiracy theories that don't actually lead us in a more productive place.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Just one point, though --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: He did shutdown travel three days after it was raised. So I mean, maybe you could have done it the same day.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: And he got criticized. He was called racist.  WILLIAMS: Well, listen. In fact, he was send -- people who were still coming in -- I think it's more than half million people still came from China because you had Americans coming back from that area. And you had people coming from Italy. You had people coming from Germany and from Britain. So it -- let's argue about the effectiveness in another way.  I'm just saying, we as a country, were slow to respond. And let's focus now on what we can do, because right now even as we reopen businesses, what we are going to see is that people are slow to get back to the restaurants, slow to get back on an airplane, slow to get back --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: Enough with the blame game. It's on China.  COMPAGNO: All right, guys. We are awaiting President Trump and the Coronavirus task force briefing. In the meantime, President Trump is already launching attacks on Joe Biden. We will play that tape for you next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WILLIAMS: Welcome back. We continue to monitor the start of the White House Coronavirus task force briefing. But let's turn to some 2020 politics first. Now that Joe Biden has become the presumptive Democrat nominee, President Trump is mocking the former VP for not yet picking up a key endorsement. Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: I don't know why President Obama hasn't supported Joe Biden a long time ago. There's something he feels is wrong. He will come out. I'm sure he's got to come out at some point, because he certainly doesn't want to see me for four more years. It does amaze me that President Obama hasn't supported Sleepy Joe. It just hasn't happened.  When is it going to happen? When is it going to happen? He knows something that you don't know. But I think I know. But you don't know, so it will be interesting.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: And speaking of President Obama, Democrats are reportedly salivating for the former president to come off the sidelines to take on President Trump. Greg, I wanted to go to you and say it's the -- is President Trump just the lighting and sowing disarray and, you know, this unity among Democrats at this moment?  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: It's weird, you know, I hadn't seen that clip. It is -- it is kind of amazing how real Trump can be, and how like almost street level, that kind of commentary is, and that everybody knows what he's talking about. And he says, it's so clearly. Obama reminds me of when I've committed to do some kind of function that I want to get out of.  He's like, get the bachelor finale, right? And he's, he's faced with his final rose, and it's supposed to be that person and he doesn't know how we got there, and he's beginning to think I need to get away. So, the bad news is Obama hasn't endorsed Joe Biden. The good news is Joe Biden has endorsed Obama.  WILLIAMS: Emily, but isn't -- I mean, does it matter when he does it? I don't think there's any question that he's going to endorse Joe Biden.  EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS HOST: I think it does matter, Juan. And here's why I totally loved your intro song to this block. Do you remember Eddie and the Cruisers which that song was in that soundtrack? When Wordman is sitting at the computer or sitting at the at the piano, and he was teaching Eddie about this stanza, remember? And it was basically that after a pause, what follows holds more weight.  And I think I assume that's what is happening with the Obama endorsement. Of course, it's inevitable, but it's probably going to happen around the convention post Coronavirus, when Democrats who are totally thirsty and ready for that messianic moment will lap it up and then it'll dominate all the airwaves.  And I think Joe Biden obviously what he has in front of him though, his two biggest challenges while uniting the party, but we've already seen him sort of capitulate to Bernie and Elizabeth Warren in that, but it's (AUDIO GAP) and then how to attack the president post (AUDIO GAP).  WILLIAMS: OK, Emily, we're having a few technical problems with that. Let me -- let me ask Dana to pop in here. Dana, Emily was making the point that right now Coronavirus dominates everything. Don't you think it would be smart to save a big endorsement for when it could dominate the news, that would be Obama endorsing Biden?  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, I think President Trump is probably the number one politician that's ever understood mass media in the -- in the moment, and he knows how to dominate it, and he's done super well. The second best is President Obama and his team. So I think that if they were to do it now, it would just get buried and it would be fizzled. And then that big punch that they would get out of it would just go away.  I don't know if it'll happen around the convention, I would imagine so. But also, we already know that President Obama has been working the phones behind the scenes. He was on the phone with Bernie Sanders, in fact, right before he dropped out.  I do want to say one thing about Joe Biden. He announced a couple of things today that might have -- people might have missed. He has gone Bernie Sanders way on a couple of things. He announced two policy proposals today, and I'm sorry, I'm looking down at my phone just to tell you. He said he would lower the Medicare age to 60, which would blow up that program even faster.  That's not Medicare for all, but it's still not going in the right direction with longer lifespans, and people healthy and able to work. And the second thing he said is he would do a huge, massive amount of student loan debt. Now, let me qualify that by saying low and middle-income borrowers, but again, it just shows how far Bernie Sanders was able to pull Joe Biden to the left.  WILLIAMS: So Jesse, picking up on Dana's point, you see the president trying to separate the Bernie Bros from Joe Biden and saying, hey, come over here. That's what he was tweeting yesterday. And now you see him today in all of these comments saying, oh, Obama didn't endorse and you know, we don't know about whether or not Bernie is really on the train with Joe Biden. Do you see this as just politics? I mean, Greg said he saw it as just brutal direct politics.  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: I used to pull those kinds of stunts in high school. I used to go up to a friend of mine at the lunch table and said, you know, what, Andy's been talking a lot of trash. And then I go to John, and I'd say, hey, John, you know, Andy's talking trash about you. And then later in the lunchroom, they'd fight and I just sit back and watch the brawl.  But that's what Trump does. He just kind of like makes people go after each other. About the endorsement, you don't endorse during a pandemic, so he's got to wait. But every day he waits gives the president an opportunity to just kind of stoke that fire.  In an ideal world, they do some big announcement in a swing state in front of a huge crowd this summer. But that -- I don't know if that's possible during this time of social mitigation. So you don't know when it's going to be, but if they try to produce something on television, it's just going to look stilted.  But the bottom line is, Barack Obama knows that Joe can't cut it. He doesn't have what it takes. He never did, never will. And if you read any book about the Obama administration, everybody says the same thing.  WILLIAMS: All right, the daily White House Coronavirus Task Force briefing, it's coming up. But directly ahead, President Trump weighing in on the insane documentary Tiger King, yes, Tiger King, so stay tuned. That's next on THE FIVE.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: The White House Coronavirus Task Force is about to come out and give another briefing. While we wait for that, let's do this. President Trump was asked about a potential pardon for Joe Exotic, the star the hit Netflix documentary Tiger King. He's currently serving a 22-year prison sentence over a murder for hire plot. Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I know nothing about it. His 22 years for what? What did he do? He allegedly hired someone to murder an animal rights activists, but he said that he didn't do that, and he was --  TRUMP: You think he didn't do it? Are you on his side?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well --  TRUMP: Are you -- are you recommending a pardon?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, I'm not advocating it.  TRUMP: As a reporter, you're not allowed to do that. You'd be criticized by these. Would you recommend to pardon?  JIM ACOSTA, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, CNN: I'm not weighing in on Tiger King.  TRUMP: I don't think you would. I don't think you would. Go ahead, you have a question?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE)  TRUMP: I'll take a look.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: So Juan, was that inappropriate question to ask during a pandemic?  WILLIAMS: I think it's a waste of time, but it's not inappropriate, Greg. You can ask whatever the president whatever you want to ask. I mean, that's the chair. You're the -- you're in the press. But I did think, as you say, this is an important serious issue in the country, the pandemic, and I think we should be focused on that.  I will say that's -- I've been watching that show, Tiger King -- and man you got, you know, gay polygamy, you got animal abuse, you got -- it's unbelievable, murder for hire plots. And then of course, there's the whole issue of whether or not one of the characters killed her husband. O.J. Simpson tweeting that she may have better husband to the tigers. Tiger sashimi, he said.  GUTFELD: Yes. Just a typical weekend in my house. Hey, Jesse, you know, it was a silly question -- it was a silly question, but unlike like Acosta, it was intentionally silly.  WATTERS: Yes. I mean, I was entertained by it. I don't care. I mean, I don't see how people have Time to watch Tiger King while these Task Force briefings are on. These things go on until 8:00. After eight, I'm exhausted. I go to bed. I like the sound of these things that murder for hire. I'm check. I'm into that. Polygamy, check. Dirtbags, check. I mean, this is right up my alley. I just haven't had time for it with everything is going on.  And Dana has made me read all these books I'm reading, DeMille, and Patterson, and Connolly, and Baldacci, I'm actually -- what's so funny?  GUTFELD: Those are really heavy books.  WATTERS: Why is everybody laughing?  COMPAGNO: We're not going to recognize you on the other side.  GUTFELD: That's quite the literature canon.  WILLIAMS: Yes.  PERINO: Well, we have to work our way up.  WATTERS: Sorry. You know, it's no Gutfeld monologues.  GUTFELD: That is true, which is available on paperback. Emily couldn't this question may have been like a be a signal that maybe things might be getting better. So you could have a little bit of levity because it feels like we're getting some -- we're seeing the light at the end of this tunnel.  WATTERS: Yes.  COMPAGNO: I think that's a good way of looking at it, Greg.  GUTFELD: Thank you.  COMPAGNO: But I will say what's so funny to me is unlike the entire country, I've never watched Tiger King and I never even saw a trailer for it. So in my head, I concocted that it was about this guy who like had all these, you know, rescue tigers and did cool stuff in this kind of big, like farm refuge area. So when Juan was listing the stuff that this is about, I'm like, Oh, my God. I mean -- and then when I heard about the question with President Trump, and that he's been, you know, incarcerated. So the whole thing to me now, my daydream has been shattered.  GUTFELD: Dana, so I put it to you. Should President Trump pardon Tiger King and make him the head of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service?  PERINO: That is an excellent question. I think we'll have to wait until after the election to see if that could actually pass muster. One thing about that question is that kind of showed that the President is just like us, right? So maybe he hasn't watched it, he hasn't heard about it.  But, you know, we are dealing with a very serious time. If I was in the room, I wouldn't have asked the question, but I do think that was pretty funny that the President, the way he handled it, and it just gave a moment of levity for the country. That's not a bad thing. That's actually good. But I would also say that show is so boring and stupid. And I watched one episode, and not watching anymore.  GUTFELD: Wow. That's what Elaine has said too. She didn't like it either. And I'm like -- and so then I was interested in all that polygamy, and she was like, not having it, Greg. So anyway, could the pandemic be the end of the handshake? I hope so. Hear what Dr. Fauci said about that next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PERINO: The White House Coronavirus Task Force briefing, it's coming up. And this pandemic could cause a lot of our normal human behavior to go the way of the dinosaurs. The symbol handshake could be one of them. Take a look at what Dr. Anthony Fauci is saying.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: I don't think in reality that we're going to all of a sudden never again shake hands. But I think I threw that out there to get people to start thinking much more about personal hygiene and the -- and the way that impacts the spread of a really deadly infection like we're going through right now.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: Now I have to say, me myself, I have an excellent handshake. And my mom and dad taught me that early on, I have a great handshake, but not everybody does, Jesse. And it does give you a measure of a person if their handshake is weak.  WATTERS: Yes, I size people up like a politician when I shake their hands. You get a measure of a man that way, then you can maybe grab them by the shoulder or the bicep and do that. I like that. I'm a politician like that. Someone like Greg that freaks them out. Greg is looking forward to this new non-handshake world. He doesn't like to be touched. He doesn't like to have to extend his arm. This is just going to create a lot of awkward moments though.  If the handshake all of a sudden becomes optional, you're going to have a lot of -- out there, you know, and obviously the fist-bumps to bro-ey for Greg. He can't pull that off. It's too athletic. There's just a lot of room for error when the handshake becomes optional.  PERINO: Greg, what would you like to see replace the handshake?  GUTFELD: Well, this is another industry that's going to die What happens to the joy buzzer industry? Anyway, I am completely --  PERINO: Great question.  GUTFELD: I am completely for this. Jesse is right. Hands are basically filthy (INAUDIBLE) that you can never take off. And you can keep watching them and watching them like Lady Macbeth, but you never get the bacteria. Was it Lady Macbeth, or was it the lady from Hamlet, or was it the lady down the block? Anyway, you're covered in bacteria, and viruses, and fecal matter, and it's disgusting. So I am -- I am all for no more handshakes. I think we should appropriate from other cultures, cultures that do not shake hands and steal whatever they do.  PERINO: All right, well, maybe we should do a segment on that tomorrow. Emily, any ideas on what that could be?  COMPAGNO: Well, I was thinking about today on my morning walk about the group fitness industry, like never again can I be in a sole cycle class with other people sweat like flying into every orifice and me being OK with it. I just feel like it's going to take me a long time to be comfortable with a lot of things like that and subways. And I mean, frankly, I'm amazed that we've persevered the human species this long anyway.  PERINO: Hey, Juan, what about like an air-kiss?  WILLIAMS: An air-kiss? Yes, well, I don't know. So, I guess -- I guess hugs and air-kisses, that's too close. That's within the six feet limit there, Dana. I think though, I think back to some of the famous people in history like Howard Hughes and Nikola Tesla, even in modern day's Michael Jackson, President Trump, these are germophobes. This is their moment. If you're a germophobe, welcome to the new reality.  PERINO: All right, ""ONE MORE THING"" is up next. And we are going to have ""ONE MORE THING"" today.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WATTERS: It's time now for ""ONE MORE THING."" Greg?  GUTFELD: Well, once again, it's time for Greg's ""There's a wombat in my dryer"" news. Yeah, this is 10th in a series of 300. You know, in these tough times, everybody could use a good snuggle to get warm and cozy. And look check out this little fellow. Yes, it's actually a wombat in a nice warm dryer enjoying the -- you know, you probably can't get a better feeling than being inside a dryer of warm clothes. Look at that. Isn't that great? And then he gets a spin.  WATTERS: Oh, God.  GUTFELD: He gets to spin. This is the Sleepy Burrows Wombat Sanctuary, which is oddly enough across the street from Fox.  PERINO: Wait, is that their pet?  GUTFELD: It's right across the street from Fox. No social distancing there. And that's my wombat news.  WATTERS: That was a good one, Greg. Dana?  PERINO: But wait, Greg, is that their pet?  GUTFELD: Yes. It's a sanctuary.  PERINO: Oh my gosh. OK. Oh, OK, sanctuary, like a Tiger King. OK, got it. All right, so a senior and high risk shoppers at all across Atlanta and Louisiana, they got a wonderful surprise when they got to the register. When they had all their stuff, and they're going to put it through the register, they got ready to checkout, and then they were told that Tyler Perry had paid their grocery tab in full.  Yes, the T.V. and movie mogul picked up the grocery tabs at 44 Kroger stores across Atlanta and all 29 Winn Dixie locations in Louisiana. The grocery store chain shared photos of a few of their customers learning that their carts were going to be free, and there were a lot of grateful tears that were shed. And if you like stories like that, if you go to foxnews.com/americatogether, you can see all sorts of great wonderful acts of kindness happening all around us. I personally can't get enough of them.  WATTERS: That's fantastic. All right, Juan, you're up.  WILLIAMS: All right, so let's have some fun. Let's go on a teddy bear hunt. Take a look at these windows and in them you're going to see teddy bears everywhere. The bears have been put there doing this coronavirus quarantine to create fun, a game for kids as they take bike rides, walk or get in the car with their parents. The stuffed animals Safari or teddy bear hunters, it's called, it comes from a book called we are going on a bear hunt.  It's very big in my Washington, D.C. neighborhood, even across the city. And I have seen everything thing from Paddington Bear to Minnie Mouse and stuff tigers, yes. So this is a great moment of people coming together to create a moment of fun in the midst of our social crisis. Way to go America.  WATTERS: Very nice. All right, we got Jesse's workout news. OK, so I know a lot of you guys can't go to the gym, so you have to work out at home. So my wife, Emma Watters does a workout video that everybody can participate in. If you go to her Instagram page, she goes live every day at 4:00 Emma Watters underscore, underscore, and you can follow along. I think Emily Compagno actually gets involved. She's feeling the burn. I can't do it. It's way too much for me.  And if you want to go and check out some of her past workouts, she's got a YouTube page, click the link in the bio. There you go. Stay fit together apart. Emily?  COMPAGNO: Cute. Yes, Jesse, your wife has been amazing. I've been working out with her every day so yes, that's awesome. And Juan, I too have a bear in my front window.

If the owner can’t pay it back, it’s on him or her. They did this after 9/11. It worked.

Right now, we're prepping for a huge battle. But it’s not the one you think. It's over who was right about the pandemic if the outcome turns out to be less devastating than predicted. The ""opinionverse"" will fall, once again, into a prison of two ideas. Either the outcome was less calamitous thanks to our hygiene and distancing efforts, or the outcome was less devastating because the threat was over-sold. STEVE HILTON: TO SAVE ALL LIVES IN THE CORONAVIRUS CRISIS, WE MUST SLOW THE SPREAD, BUT SPEED THE SHUTDOWN If you don't believe me, doctors still argue over how they subdued the SARS outbreak from 18 years ago.

Still, now has never been a better time to avoid the media's latest divisive offerings. With the stress of this shutdown, who needs that? But maybe we're shedding that negativity naturally. Did you notice how those TV segments we had pre-quarantine, have disappeared? Racism. Sexism. Gender pronouns. I mean, where's Antifa? Did we just stop canceling people? We may not be immune to the media's influence, but our unity has destroyed their assessments of who we are. We're sticking together, not turning on each other.

Like that MyPillow guy at a White House briefing. What a dork! “I think these briefings could be … better designed,” reporter Jim Acosta said on CNN. “The president could come out, say a few words in terms of what his administration is doing, not have these PR stunts like 'Mr. Pillow' coming out and giving a plug for his company.” MYPILLOW FOUNDER MIKE LINDELL, AT WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS BRIEFING, TELLS PEOPLE TO PRAY DURING CRISIS On MSNBC, Chris Hayes said: “It’s obviously above my pay grade. I don’t make the call whether we take [White House press conferences] or not, but it seems crazy to me that everyone is taking them when you have the MyPillow guy getting up there talking about reading the Bible.” It wasn't just TV. Non-essential bozos with blue checkmarks also mocked MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell on social media. While these turds snarked away, Lindell was converting his business to make 50,000 face masks daily. So laugh all you want. The object of your ridicule will save lives. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER The fact is, Lindell is an American success story. But because he mentions the Bible too much, he's worthy of media scorn. They’re so much better than him! So as we strive to unite against one of the greatest foes we've ever faced, you’ve got to ask: Does that help? Does MSNBC’s Chuck Todd help? In an interview, he asked former Vice President Joe Biden: “Do you think there is blood on the president’s hands considering the slow response? Or is that too harsh of a criticism?” Biden responded: ""I think that’s a little too harsh."" Once again, the media are framing this pandemic as their divisive playground. For them, the perfect medication is a cheap shot. When “The Five” sounded the alarm about the virus back in January, what was Chuck concerned about? ""I think that one of the reasons the Senate Republicans want to get this over with as quickly as possible, because you want the maximum amount of time between whatever this is and the voters voting,"" former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele told Chuck at the time. ""There is going to be a lot of news in the next nine months."" Todd responded: ""Coronavirus ... is going to impact China in ways on our economy that we haven't really contemplated."" Whoa. Concerned about the economy, not people? Now, who has blood on their hands? See, Chuck? The ""blood on your hands"" game can be extended indefinitely to everyone. If trying to put an unknown virus in the context of other illnesses, like the media did, then they have blood on their hands.

32,FOX,"Media pundits tear into President Trump's coronavirus briefings. This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" March 31, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino, along with Greg Gutfeld, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Dagen McDowell. It is 5:00 in New York City. This is The Five. All right, Happy Tuesday, the president and the Coronavirus task force, they are set to hold another briefing as the pandemic in America gets deadlier by the minute.  We'll take you to the White House once that starts. You won't miss a thing. The virus now killing more than 3,600 people in the United States and infecting more than 180,000, but there is some encouraging news. New data suggests that social distancing restrictions are beginning to slow the spread of the disease in some areas.  And President Trump revealing that the U.S. has tested more than one million Americans. There's also a new debate starting over a report that says the CDC may start telling all Americans to start wearing masks in public. Surgeon General Jerome Adams is pushing back on that, saying there is no data to support it. Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, if you want to put that aside for healthcare workers. We get that. But if it could actually help us, we would love to know.  (CROSSTALK)  JEROME ADAMS, UNITED STATES SURGEON GENERAL: But again, the data doesn't show that it helps individuals. Here's the bottom line.  (CROSSTALK)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We know in China they walk around with them, right.  ADAMS: Yes, and they have a culture there of wearing masks and everyone already has one. And they're more accustomed to wearing them without touching their faces. If you are sick, wear a mask. And you have a mask and it makes you feel better, then by all means wear it. But know that the more you touch your face, the more you put yourself at risk.  And know that right now, the data isn't quite there to say that there is a net benefit of individuals to the individual of wearing a mask.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: All right. So we have a lot to get to today. One thing, Jesse, I noted just now, and I read that 180,000 cases have been identified in America. Just three hours ago, when I did the daily briefing, that was 174,000. And so I asked the producers before this show, like, is that accurate? Are we getting results back from these tests so quickly that we are seeing big jumps like that? And the answer was yes.  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Right. We're getting a lot data and it's shocking to some people. But if you look back, the American media and our government were honest about the numbers as opposed to other countries. We'll talk about that later. Something that really struck me yesterday was when the CEO of United Technologies got out there at the podium at the Rose Garden and said this is a war.  And you go into war with a strategy, but you win a war with logistics. So if you think about that for a second, this is an invisible enemy that's jumping from person to person, family to family, state to state. And the federal government is coordinating the production and manufacturing distribution of thousands of different types of medical products all across this great country.  And you see the coordination, the communications, labor, business intelligence, everything that goes into that. It should make the American people feel really proud about the fight that's going on right now. So when the president of the United States, who is basically the general in this battle, has a certain vantage point.  Because he couldn't see this beautiful, logistical mosaic across the map of this country with trucks and planes and all this product moving in and out, he is very, very proud of what's going on, and speaks with such reverence to the workers and the executives, and to the mayors and the governors and the doctors and nurses that are in the frontlines fighting this thing.  And from a guy that made a lot of money building and developing and creating some of the most iconic towers and resorts and hotels in this country, he really has a deep appreciation for the mobilization that's taking place, and the scale and the speed with which it's taking place. So when you hear people in the press or on the other side of the political aisle ask snarkey questions or kind of denigrate the effort that's going into this.  The president takes that very personally, because he is saying you are dishonoring and disrespecting the tens of thousands of Americans that are putting their blood, sweat, and tears into this battle. And he doesn't want to accept that. And I think everybody just needs to recognize we're going to win. And we're going to win because of the amount of effort that's being put in place by the hardworking men and women of this country.  PERINO: There is no doubt, a ton of hard work being done. And Greg, also this -- just questions as doctors and the CDC, everyone's trying to figure out whether we as civilians out there trying to do our part and socially distance should be wearing masks. There was a doctor on the show earlier today. Take a listen to his point of view. I want to get your take on it after that.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you are infected, you get some protection from people around you. It's also a psychological effect. That is, if you're wearing a mask, you're going to be more aware of your surroundings. You'll be more aware of the danger that you can be infected or possibly infect others. And then finally, although you have to put the mask on your face, it can prevent you from touching your face, which is one of the major ways you can be infected.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: Interesting to figure out how to make a decision. The Surgeon General and then you have this doctor, what should we do?  GUTFELD: All right. The logic from the Surgeon General, to me, seems a bit flawed, because obviously, I'm an expert. My belief is that they didn't tell us the entire truth about the masks because they didn't want to run out of them. They wanted the hospital workers to have them. And I totally understand that. But you run into a problem here, the general population without masks could increase infections, which sends more patients to the hospital workers who end up being infected.  So you see that it's this non-stop little cycle of infection, when in fact it would have been just better if we made more masks so that hospital workers would have masks and also so would the general public. I think the masks are valuable because it keeps you from touching your face and it makes you more cognizant of the transmission, and it just makes sense.  Any kind of obstruction or friction will reduce an impact. I do want to use a sports analogy that kind of gives me hope through all of this as were going into our third week. In auto sports, you have a yellow flag, which indicates a hazard on the track. That means all drivers must slow down and line up behind the pace car.  So what we're doing right now, and the key for this to work, is that we are all trying to stay put in the same place so that when the race resumes, no one gets shafted or ruined. You can't jump in front of anybody else during this time. We have to look at this next four weeks that we have as a pause. We are all pausing.  And I believe for this to really work, we should consider pausing the rent, pausing utilities, pausing car loans. So nothing goes in and nothing goes out, literally a yellow flag for the economic track. So no one can overtake anybody else. Because right now, I mean, I feel in a very surreal sense, a sense of unity, a feeling like one brain.  I -- the United States right now is much like how a hive is working where we're all kind of working together in a weird psychic way going trying to do the right thing. And all of these myths about us being too capitalist or too greedy or evil bigots or racist, it's all gone. None of those conflicts that the media loves to drum up, it's not there.  We're all thinking the same. And I think right now, the yellow flag idea of pausing it and everybody having confidence that no one's going to get screwed is really, really important to get through this.  PERINO: Yeah, I agree. I agree. And let me ask you, Dagen. I heard that you were able to see the USNS Comfort as it came down the Hudson, I believe. And it's pretty interesting to see how unifying that really is.  DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Well, thank you for making me a blubbering mess bringing that up, because I did. It was just this -- but it was like a heart-filling moment. It wasn't gut-wrenching. I was literally at home walking the dogs and trying to eat some lunch before I came back to do your show yesterday. And I looked out and I just saw this giant ship in the middle of the Hudson.  And it just meant so much to me personally knowing that here is -- here people are coming to this city's rescue and the nation's rescue. But economically, just really quickly to Greg's point in terms of our wartime footing. Somebody who probably will never get enough credit for what's being done as people aren't able to pay their bills to prevent a nation from having liquidity problems and basically companies having solvency problems.  And as Jay Powell, the head of the Federal Reserve, they've already done extraordinary things with him at the leadership. And he's not some monetary policy wonk, some nerd. He is a lawyer. And he was willing to -- The Wall Street journal wrote about it today, willing to act quickly and just throw everything at this problem.  Six unique lending facilities and he's got $450 billion at the Treasury. Because that stimulus plan, he can now go out and lend to cities, states, and even small businesses, medium-sized businesses with potentially another four and a half trillion dollars worth of firepower. So he is one of the warriors.  PERINO: Right. And people need to take advantage of that because that money is there for them. And Juan, another thing that's been so inspiring is how communities are figuring out a way to help out. We had a story earlier about two young people in their 20s figured out a way to find out who in the neighborhood needed to get groceries, like elderly people that shouldn't go out.  They really need to stay isolated. And they had so many volunteers. And they were able to go out and do shopping for them and take it to them. And this is happening all over the country. And it really is inspiring. We should support it.  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Without a doubt. I think that's the good news. And you know, I think so much of what's happening in New York, like, the ship that Dagen saw. I think these are things that just lift your heart. Just more reminders, you know that people can come together in moments of crisis. And what we are seeing in New York now, you know, people talking about -- you talk about even nationally the number of deaths surpassing 9/11.  I think people have to come to understand. We're going to have to deal with the fact that it -- other communities are going to have to contend with what New York is now experiencing. So we need people who are willing to lend a hand to get out there even -- especially, I would think, the medical professionals take that risk in order to satisfy.  Another thing that struck me was a picture I saw today of so many cars lined up outside Pittsburgh to get to a food bank. And you know it -- you stop and think about what we heard in terms of unemployment numbers last week. Goldman Sachs now said unemployment may go up to 15 percent, the GDP down about 30 percent. You know, we end today -- the quarter in terms of the stock market.  And we know that it's been a very rough quarter, one of the roughest since 08. I think historically might be the roughest. So I think in all those situations, you have to say we're going through something. And the helping hand, the smile, the willingness of those young people you were talking about, Dana, really is inspirational.  It's a sense of community and reliance on leadership that comes sometimes not from the top but from each other.  PERINO: Indeed. All right, President Trump and the Coronavirus task force are about ready to come out for another briefing. So while we wait for that, we'll get right back to you. Greg is up next on why the media is now attacking the MyPillow CEO. Stay tuned for that.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: When faced with criticism, the media will say it's their job to hold people accountable like that MyPillow guy at the briefing. What a dork.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think these briefings could be, I think, better designed. The president could come out. Say a few words in terms of what his administration is doing, not have these, you know, PR stunts like Mr. Pillow coming out and giving a plug for his company.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's obviously above my pay grade. I don't make the call. But it seems crazy to me that everyone is still taking them when you've got the MyPillow guy getting up there talking about reading the bible.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Oh, reading the bible. But it wasn't just TV. Nonessential bozos with blue checkmarks also took to Twitter to mock Mike Lindell. But while these turds snark away, Lindell was converting his business into making 50,000 masks a day, so yeah, laugh all you want. The object of your ridicule will save lives. The fact is Lindell is an American success story.  But because he mentions the bible too much, he is worthy of media scorn, because they're so much better than him. So as we strive to unite against one of the greatest foes we've ever faced, you've got to ask does that really help, and does this help?  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you think there is blood on the president's hands, considering the slow response, or is that too harsh of a criticism?  JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think that's a little too harsh.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Once again, the media frames this pandemic as their divisive playground. For them, the perfect medication is to cheap shot. I wonder when The Five sounded the alarm on the virus back in January, what was Chuck's concern?  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think that one of the reasons Senate Republicans want to get this over with as quickly as possible, is because you want the maximum amount of time between whatever this is and the voters voting. I think -- if you look at happened in the summer of 2016, leaving aside the election itself, Zika virus, Orlando nightclub shooting, there's going to be a lot of news in the next nine months. And ultimately --  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Coronavirus that is clearly a -- this is going to impact China in ways in our economy that we haven't really contemplated.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Concerned about China's economy, not the American people. Now, who has blood on their hands? See, Chuck, the blood on your hands gain can be extended indefinitely to everyone. If trying to put the unknown virus in context of other illnesses, like the media did, then they have blood on their hands. If you told Americans to go about your business, like our New York politicians did, then you have blood on your hands.  If you and the media conflated the name of a drug for fish tank cleaner, then you have blood on your hands. At some point, no one has spotless hands, including Chuck, which is why we got to dump this gotcha BS. It helps no one. My advice, time to wash our hands of the blood on your hands line, then maybe the press can find a real question, one that seeks an answer instead of attention.  All right, Jesse. So you had mentioned this before in (Inaudible) what's your take on the attack on poor Mr. Pillow man.  WATTERS: The media snobs don't think Mike has the corporate pedigree to be at the Rose Garden. The media snobs hold technology executives in very high regard. But they look down on industrialists, on manufacturers, on the Procter and Gambles, United Technologies, and Jockey's, and really looked down on people that use infomercials to sell their product like Mike.  What really set them off first was saying read the bible. They don't understand Mike is a recovering addict. That's an affirmation for him. Everybody understands that people recovering from addiction do that. And it's important to them. The other thing to understand is whenever a culture is challenged by a war, a pandemic, an economic depression.  The culture always digs deeper into their faith. It's happened throughout history every single time. And the fact that the media doesn't have the empathy for that, the business intelligence, the compassion to understand that, really just makes me realize how shallow they are. On Chuck Todd and Nancy, we're at war. You can either be with us or you can be against us.  There are some people in this country that are trying to help. And there are some people in this country who are trying to divide. Listen, the president, the Democrats, no one has been perfect. We were slow with the testing, but very quick with the travel ban. And that's been much more critical in saving lives. We can play this game all day about who is positive, who is negative, and when that happened.  Nancy Pelosi, just a couple weeks ago, was in downtown San Francisco telling everybody to go to Chinatown. Get in the big crowd. Go to the restaurants and shop. She was telling everybody about impeachment while this virus was spreading. Chuck Todd moderated the Democratic presidential debate just a little while ago.  You know how many questions he asked about the virus, zero. We can do this all day long. It's not important. But what is important now is everybody needs to get on the same page and to help.  GUTFELD: I thought you were going to go all day long. Dagen, you know, there's a weird media hypocrisy in which if a religious person does something really bad, if you mention the religion, you're a bigot. But if somebody who's very religious does something good, you can make fun of them mercilessly. So you might be Islamophobic if you talk about terrorism.  But you can make fun of Mike Lindell because, you know, he mentions the bible. And people who read the bible are just a bunch of idiots according to the media.  MCDOWELL: Right. And if you don't make fun of those people who cite scripture who believe in a higher power as part of their recovery and their life and their effort to give back, if you don't make fun of those people, you're not getting invited to Chuck Todd's cocktail soiree that he's surely going to throw for all these left-wing liberal buddies when all of this is over.  But that goes to the point we are a nation that routes for recovery and redemption. We are a nation of people who believe in second chances. So I think all of these people who sit in front of TV's for a living need to go in their booed war (ph) and their man cave and look in the mirror and ask themselves, am I rooting for catastrophe.  For death, for dying, for suffering, because I think it might benefit myself somehow. And I might have more power, because I think they need a real hard check and a hard look in the mirror and ask themselves at the end of the day, do I just need to shut up?  GUTFELD: Yeah. You know, Juan, you are a God-fearing man. You go to mass every Sunday. I am not. I am an agnostic. I reflect probably more of the media than you do in that sense. Does it bother you when you see that they kind of look down their noses at somebody for being -- from openly talking about God and the bible?  WILLIAMS: Yeah, it sure would because they'd be looking down at me.  GUTFELD: Yes.  WILLIAMS: But I didn't take it the way that you did, though. I saw it as people saying that Mike Lindell stood up there and he started making political statements about, like, divine intervention in November of 2016 when Trump won. So he turned into something of a political rally when it was intended to be a briefing for the American people on the Coronavirus.  I think President Trump even said, you know, I'm surprised he said that, signaling to me that he didn't set it up. I don't know. But it didn't seem appropriate, I guess, to the president even. My bigger point though in regard to, you know, the Chuck Todd thing is I think that you're right in that was a divisive kind of statement. It wasn't about insider information.  It was about setting up a fight. Let me hold your jacket while you two go, you know, head-to-head. I didn't think that was right. But I do think that if it's about the question of mobilization right now, you know, America is mobilized for action in dealing with this virus. If that's the right response now, why can't you say, hey, that would have been the right response earlier?  It would've been the right response a month ago. So, to me, if that's the direction of the journalist, Chuck Todd, going there, I would say that's informational. That's legitimate. Let's just look at where we are, what we are doing. But setting up a phoney fight and even, as you heard Former Vice President Biden, he said, hey, I wouldn't say that. That's too harsh. That's too far.  GUTFELD: I think -- the problem with that question about questioning how fast one should do something can be applied to every single good thing in life, because every single good thing in life could be started sooner, but that -- we'll save that. Dana, I keep hearing a train. Is that in your town in the background?  PERINO: Can you hear it?  GUTFELD: I can hear the train.  PERINO: I was worried you would think it was my stomach.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: I can recognize that New Jersey train anywhere, because I've been there. I know the train. It's your backyard.  PERINO: Yes. It came by yesterday, too. So I would say three things. I remember when I was Press Secretary. There was one network news reporter. I'm not going to name him. And I remember as the Deputy Press Secretary one time being in the room where they were all watching this on the screen where president was giving a speech. And at the end of the speech, the president said may God bless you, may God bless America.  And this reporter slammed his hands on the table and said I can't stand it. I can't take it anymore, all this God talk. And he was, like, screaming this in the room. And I was just shocked. But then I realized. They would make fun of George W. Bush for being a faithful person all the time. The second thing I would say is asking a question of blood on your hands is a real clichAc.  GUTFELD: Yeah.  PERINO: It's just like -- it's sort of when somebody says how would you -- what grade would you give yourself for the Coronavirus? Like, those questions to me are so lazy.  GUTFELD: Yeah.  PERINO: But also, let's say something nice about Joe Biden who didn't take the bait and who said, no, I think that's a little too harsh. I mean, that was very statesmanlike, and he should get some credit for that.  GUTFELD: You know, the only person you could -- I probably ask, you know, do you have blood on your hands is OJ Simpson, right? I mean, because it is so --  WATTERS: Not to his face.  GUTFELD: Not to his face. And if he is holding a knife, run.  PERINO: Greg, let me ask you.  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: Do you think any of these reporters would ask President Xi that same question?  GUTFELD: Probably not. That is a good question. But, you know, I can't read minds. But yeah, I think it's just -- it's one of those fallback questions that we should just get rid of it. It's only --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: That -- denigrating question out.  GUTFELD: Jesse, your turn.  WATTERS: You know --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: But this is Meet the Press. I don't think Chuck has the chops to host that show. But regardless, the White House Corona task force --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: -- to brief very soon and we're going to wait for that. And people who don't practice social distancing could end up behind bars, the mayor of Washington, D.C. threatening 90 days in jail for residents who violate her stay-at-home order. Offenders could also be facing a hefty $5,000 fine. The mayor now backtracking a little bit says he would enforce that order with a heavy hand.  And take a look at this scene coming out of LA, a huge line of police officers were forced to break up a birthday party for a one-year-old, because around 40 people attended. No one was arrested in that city's attempt to enforce a stay-at-home order. Juan, these governors or these local officials, they have a lot of power in a time like this.  Some are using it smartly. Some are using it a little heavy-handedly, but it's all on them. How do you think it's shaking out across the country?  WILLIAMS: Well, this is my personal experience, Jesse, because I'm in D.C. And so last night when I went for a walk with my wife, I went down by the local recreation center. And there was a guard standing by the tennis courts, by the basketball courts, and the swimming arena there. Keeping people out, telling people you can't play tennis. You can't get on the basketball court, a guard.  I was like, I've never seen anything like this. But what's good about this is that there's coordination.  So you have Ralph Northam who's the governor in neighboring Virginia, you have Larry Hogan, who's the governor, neighboring Maryland, all issuing stay at home orders. Now the mayor, as you said, in D.C. walked it back a little bit and says, we're not trying to put people in jail, but we want to make sure they get the message that right now social distancing is helping us, is helping America to slow the rate -- the rate of this virus spreading. So I think that's pretty good.  WATTERS: OK, we're going to take you guys live in White House where the president is briefing the nation on coronavirus.  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Our country is in the midst of a great national trial unlike any we have ever faced before. You will see it -- you see it probably better than most. We're at war with a deadly virus. Success in this fight will require the full, absolute measure of our collective strength, love, and devotion. It's very important.  Each of us has the power through our own choices and actions to save American lives and rescue the most vulnerable among us. That's why we really have to do what we all know is right. Every citizen is being called upon to make sacrifices. Every business is being asked to fulfill its patriotic duty. Every community is making fundamental changes to how we live, work and interact each and every day.  And I wouldn't be surprised to see this going on long into the future when this virus has gone faded. Some of the things we're doing now will be very good practice for the future, including for not getting the flu which is very devastating also. So some of what we're learning now will live on into the future. I really believe that. Shaking hands or not shaking hands, washing hands all the time, staying a little apart.  15 days ago, we published nationwide guidelines to slow the spread of the virus. on Sunday, I announced that this campaign will be extended until April 30th. In a few moments, Dr. Birx will explain the data that formed the basis for our decision to extend the guidelines and Dr. Fauci will explain why it's absolutely critical for the American people to follow the guidelines for the next 30 days. It's a matter of life and death, frankly. It's a matter of life and death.  I know our citizens will rise to the occasion and they already have sacrificed a lot. We had the greatest economy in the history of our country. We're the greatest economy in the world. We had the best unemployment numbers and employment numbers that we've ever had by far. And in one instant, we said, we have no choice but to close it up. Just as Americans have always done, they will do a job like few have seen before, and they're proud to do it and I see that. There's a great pride going on right now.  Before we hear from our experts, we have a few other announcements. Today, the Treasury Department and Small Business Administration announced further details on the Paycheck Protection Program, which was made possible by the $2 trillion relief bill I signed into law last week. Nearly 350 billion dollars in loans will soon be available through lending partners to help small businesses meet payroll and other expenses for up to two months.  These loans will be forgiven as long as businesses keep paying their workers. This includes sole proprietors and independent contractors. Applications will be accepted starting this Friday, April 3rd. So, on Friday, April 3rd, that's when it begins.  Earlier today I spoke with leading internet and phone providers who are doing a tremendous job of keeping our internet and lines of communication flowing under very strongly increased strain, the businesses more than anybody has seen before because everyone's inside. They're all making calls.  Among the leaders I spoke to were Hans Vestberg of Verizon Communications, Randall Stephenson of AT&T, Mike Sievert of T Mobile, Thomas Rutledge of Charter Communications, Brian Roberts of Comcast, John Malone of Liberty Media, Dexter Goei of Altice, Michel Combes of Sprint, and Aryeh Bourkoff of LionTree. Also, Pat Esser of Cox Communications and Jeffrey Storey of CenturyLink. They're doing an incredible job.  If you look at other continents, if you look at Europe, they went a different route than we did and much different route. We were talking about that just a little while ago. And they're having tremendous problems. Other countries are having problems, other continents are having problems. But with business at a level that nobody's seen it before, on the internet, it's holding up incredibly well. And they expect that to continue no matter what happened. And no matter how much more gains which have, it can gain more than it already is. I don't because this setting records.  Let me also update you on the distribution of urgency needed resources and supplies. And we have a lot of numbers. I'm going to let Mike Pence speak to that in a little while. But we're giving massive amounts of medical equipment and supplies to the 50 states. We also are holding back quite a bit. We have almost 10,000 ventilators that we have ready to go.  We have to hold them back because the surge is coming and it's coming pretty strong. And we want to be able to immediately move it into place without going and taking it. So we're ready to go. And we've also distributed. I just spoke with Governor of Michigan, had a great conversation and we sent a large number of ventilators to Michigan. We're sending them to Louisiana. We send additional ventilators to New York, additional ventilators to New Jersey.  And I will say in New York, FEMA is supplying 250 ambulances and 500 EMTs to help respond to the increasing caseload. That's a lot of ambulances. In California, the Army Corps of Engineers is developing eight facilities to expand hospital capacity up to 50,000 beds, 50,000. And I had a great conversation last night with Gavin Newsom. He's doing -- he's doing a really good job. We were in constant communications.  The USNS Mercy Hospital ship is now operational. It's in Los Angeles and receiving patients. And in New York, as you know, the Comfort, everybody wants that. It's in place and will be very short while receiving large numbers of patients, over 1,000 rooms and 12 operating rooms.  FEMA has also provided 100 travel trailers to assist with housing needs and we're ordering hundreds more in Michigan. FEMA will soon deliver an addition to the ventilators, 250 bed, field hospital and Army Corps of Engineers is evaluating locations to build alternate care facilities. So we're doing a field hospital in Michigan of 250 beds and we may be doubling it up soon, depending on the need. They're doing a good job with beds in Michigan, but they may need more than the 250. So, FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers are prepared to go there quickly and get it done.  In Louisiana, we're delivering to field hospitals to provide 500 new hospital beds. I've been talking with Governor John Bel Edwards and the Army Corps of Engineers has been really doing incredible work establishing 3,000-bed alternate care site at the New Orleans Convention Center, which will be operational, believe it or not, this week.  So we're doing the 3,000-bed alternate care site and we're also doing a 500-bed new hospital. And that's in Louisiana, which really got hit. It started very late and it was looking good and then all of a sudden it just reared up. It came from nowhere.  In addition to the supplies we're delivering, we're also giving hospitals the flexibility to use new facilities including surgical care centers to care for hospital patients who are not infected. For example, I know that many expectant mothers are understandably concerned about exposing their newborn babies to the virus and they should be. With our action yesterday, hospitals now have the authority to create special areas for mothers to deliver their babies in a very safe and healthy environment, totally separate.  Over the past few months, the U.S. State Department has organized one of the largest and most complex international evacuation operations in American history. Mike Pompeo has been working round the clock along with Ambassador O'Brien. Since January 29th, we have successfully repatriated over 25,000 Americans from more than 50 countries where they were literally stuck in some cases, locked in.  And I salute the incredible public servants at the Department of State as well as their counterparts at DHS and HHS, who have played such an important role in doing this. You probably read about the young people in Peru and young people in Brazil, and they were absolutely stuck and we got them out, got them -- almost everybody is out now, back home with their parents, their wives, their husbands.  I want every American to be prepared for the hard days that lie ahead. We're going to go through a very tough two weeks. And then hopefully, as the experts are predicting, as I think a lot of us are predicting, after having studied so hard, you're going to start seeing some real light at the end of the tunnel. But this is going to be a very painful, very, very painful two weeks.  When you look and see a knife, the kind of death that's been caused by this invisible enemy, it's incredible. I was watching last night, Governor Murphy of New Jersey say 29 people died today, meaning yesterday, and others talking about numbers far greater. But you get to know a state, I know New Jersey so well, and you had 29 people, and hundreds and other locations, hundreds and other states. And this is going to be a rough two- week period.  As a nation, we face difficult few weeks, as we approach that really important day when we're going to see things get better all of a sudden, and it's going to be like a burst of light. I really think and I hope our strength will be tested and our endurance will be tried, but America will answer with love and courage and ironclad resolve. This is the time for all Americans to come together and do our part.  I appreciate a lot of the media. We've had a lot of really good things said. I think only good things can be said when you look at the job that's been done. I've just spoke with Franklin Graham was an extraordinary person and Samaritan's purse has been, like so many others just been amazing and so fast. They did it so fast. He's been doing that for a long time, but I think people are really seeing what they have done. Franklin Graham, very special family.  As we send planeloads of masks and gloves and supplies to the communities battling the plague -- and that's what it is, this is a plague -- we also send our prayers. We pray for the doctors and the nurses, for the paramedics, and the truck drivers, and the police officers, and the sanitation workers, and above all the people fighting for their lives in New York, and all across our land.  I watched as doctors and nurses went into a certain Hospital in Elmhurst this morning. I know Elmhurst, Queens. That's -- I grew up right next to it. I know the hospital very well. I've been seeing it all my life, my young life. And I will tell you that to see the scenes of trailers out there and what they're doing with those trailers, their freezers, and nobody could even believe it. And I spoke to some of my friends, they can't believe what they're seeing.  And I watched the doctors and the nurses walking into that hospital this morning. It's like military people going into battle going into war. The bravery is incredible. And I just have to take my hat. I would take my hat. If I were wearing a hat, I grip that hat off so fast that I would say you people are just incredible. They really are. They're very brave. They're going in, and they don't know, you have -- you have lots of things flying around in the air. You don't know what you're touching, is it safe.  And you also see where you have friends that go into the hospital and you say how is he doing, two days later and they say, sir, he's unconscious or he's in a coma. So things are happening that we've never seen before in this country. And with all of that being said, the country has come together like I've never seen it before. And we will prevail, we will win, and hopefully, it will be in a relatively short period of time.  With that, I'd like to ask Dr. Birx to come up and show you some of the latest -- the data that has been I think brilliantly put together. And right after that, I'm going to ask Dr. Fauci to speak. And Mike Pence is going to give you some of the recent events that have taken place and some of the statistics that we have that I think will be very interesting. Thank you very much. Please.  DEBORAH BIRX, CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE COORDINATOR, WHITE HOUSE: Thank you, Mr. President. If I can have the first slide, please. So always, and that's what this slide is labeled is goals of community mitigation, really highlighting that this begins in the middle in the end with community, this community and the community of the American people that are going to have to do the things for the next 30 days to make a difference.  I think you know, from that large blue mountain that you can see behind me -- and I just want to thank the five or six international and domestic modelers from Harvard, from Columbia, from Northeastern, from Imperial, who helped us tremendously. It was their models that created the ability to see what these mitigations could do, how steeply they could depress the curve from that giant blue mountain, down to that more stippled area.  In their estimates, they had between 1.5 million and 2.2 million people in the United States succumbing to this virus without mitigation. Yet through their detailed studies and showing us what social distancing would do, what people -- what would happen if people stayed home, what would happen if people were careful every day to wash their hands, and worry about touching their faces, that what an extraordinary thing this could be if every American followed these. And that takes us to that stippled mountain that's much lower a hill actually down to 100,000 to 200,000 deaths, which is still way too much. Next slide, please.  Simultaneously, there was a map modeler out of the University of Washington that model from cases up utilizing the experience around the globe to really Understand how this information that we have from Italy, and Spain, and South Korea, and China could really help us give insight into the hospital needs, the ventilator needs, and really the number of people who potentially could succumb to this illness.  It is this model that we are looking at now that provides us the most detail of the time course that is possible, but this model assumes full mitigation. It's informed every morning or every night by the reality on the ground coming in from New York, New Jersey, and around the United States, and is modeled and informed every morning so that it is adjusted, so it is up to date every day.  This is the model of the predicted fatalities and mortality in the United States. And as the President said, it's very much focused on the next two weeks and the stark reality of what this virus will do as it moves through communities. Next slide, please.  But this is a slide that gives us great hope and understanding about what is possible. On the bottom of the slide where you can barely see that blue line at the very bottom. That's the current cases in California, the cumulative cases in California, where they're doing significant testing. The next line up is Connecticut. The orange line is New Jersey. The blue line is New York. The yellow line is Washington.  We all remember Washington state it was just a month ago, when they started to have the issues in Washington State, but they brought together their communities and their health providers, and they put in strong mitigation, methods, and testing. And you can see what the result in Washington State and California is. But without the continuation for the next 30 days, anything could change. Next slide, please.  So, I'm sure you're interested in seeing all the states. So, on this slide is all 50 states and the District of Columbia. But I think it shows in stark reality, the difference between New York and New Jersey and other states with similar populations and urban areas. Our goal over the next 30 days is to ensure the states that you see the 48 across the bottom, maintain this lower level of new cases, with the hope that we don't have significant outbreaks in other states and other metro areas.  As the community comes together to work together and ensure that the health care providers around the globe and in the United States are strengthened by are resolved to continue to mitigate community by community. This is done community by community. We all know people are in their states and in their communities. And we're very dependent on each person in the United States doing the same thing, following the presidential guidelines to a tee. I know it's a lot to ask because you've done it for 15 days.  So if you can show the next slide, please. So this is what gives us a lot of hope. This is the case finding in Italy. And you can see that they're beginning to turn the corner in new cases. They're entering their fourth week of full mitigation, and showing what is possible when we work together as a community, as a country to change the course of this pandemic together.  It is this graphic and the graphic of many of the states that gives us hope of what is possible with continuing for another 30 days. Amidst all that hope, I must say that like we warned about Detroit and Chicago, we start to see changes in Massachusetts, New Orleans continues to be a problem of new cases, although they're stabilizing.  And I think it really shows the depth of dedication of the American people to the healthcare providers, because they can see the strain that this puts on every nurse doctor, respiratory therapist, pharmacists and laboratory technician that's working together to stem this tide of unrelenting sick people coming to their doors.  No one has been turned away. No one who has needed ventilation has not received ventilation. But you can see how stressful it is for each of them. So I know it's stressful to follow the guidelines. But it is more stressful and more difficult to the soldiers on the front line. As we started and we will end with its communities that will do this, there's no magic bullet. There's no magic vaccine or therapy. It's just behaviors, each of our behaviors, translating into something that changes the course of this viral pandemic over the next 30 days. Thank you.  ANTHONY FAUCI, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH: Thank you very much, Dr. Birx, Mr. President, Mr. Vice-President. So, what Dr. Birx has really said very simply is that there are really two dynamic forces that are opposing each other here. As I've mentioned several times in our briefings, the virus, if left to its own devices, will do that dark curve that Dr. Birx showed you.  The other dynamic force is what we are doing, what we're trying to do, and what we will do in the form of mitigation. Now, these are very revealing bits of data because you saw what happened in Italy where you made turn around the curve and you go. That doesn't happen all at once. It's a stepwise fashion. And if I explain the steps, which I will, you'll see why we are really convinced that mitigation is going to be doing the trick for us.  Because what you have is you have increased in new cases, at a certain rate. When the increase in new cases begin to level off, the secondary effect is less hospitalizations. The next effect is less intensive care. And the next effect is less deaths. The deaths and the intensive care and the hospitalization always lag behind that early indication that there are less new cases per day, the way we saw in Italy. And the way we're likely seeing -- I don't want to jump the gun on it. We're seeing little inklings of this right now in New York.  So what we're going to see -- and thus, we got to brace ourselves. In the next several days to a week or so, we're going to continue to see things go up. We cannot be discouraged by that because the mitigation is actually working and will work. The slide that Dr. Birx showed where you saw New York, and New Jersey, and then the cluster of other areas, our goal, which I believe we can accomplish, is to get the hotspot places the New York's, the New Jersey, and help them to get around that curve, but as importantly, to prevent those clusters of areas that have not yet gone to that spike, to prevent them from getting that spike. And the answer to that is mitigation.  Now, the 15 days that we had of mitigation, clearly have had an effect, although it's tough to quantitate it because of those two opposing forces. But the reason why we feel so strongly about the necessity of the additional 30 days is that now is the time, whenever you're having an effect, not to take your foot off the accelerator and on the brake, but to just press it down on the accelerator. And that's what I hope and I know that we can do over the next 30 days.  And as I said the other day and on one of the -- one of the interviews, we are a very strong and resilient nation. If you look at our history, we've been through some terrible ordeals. This is tough. People are suffering, people are dying. It's inconvenient from a societal standpoint, from an economic standpoint to go through this, but this is going to be the answer to our problems. So let's all pull together and make sure as we look forward to the next 30 days, we do it with all the intensity and force that we can. Thank you.  MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Thank you Mr. President. And to Dr. Birx, and Dr. Fauci, I know I speak on behalf of the President and people all across this country when I express our great admiration and appreciation to both of you for helping to steer our nation through this challenging time.  The American people have now seen what the President saw when he made the decision at the end of 15 days to slow the spread, to ask the American people to give us 30 more days to continue to put into practice the President's coronavirus guidelines for America. And as you just heard from the experts, we have reason to believe that it's working. As Dr. Fauci just said, there are difficult days ahead. Our hearts and our prayers go out to the families that have lost loved ones. And those as the president just reflected who we know are struggling at this hour in hospitals across the nation.  But to each and every one of us, do not be discouraged, because what you can do to protect your health, the health of your family, what you can do to ensure that are our health care providers have the resources and our hospitals have the capacity to meet this moment is put into practice the President's coronavirus guidelines for America. It really is what every American can do, 30 days to slow the spread, 30 days to make a difference in the lives of the American people, American families, and the life of our nation.  Allow me to give you a few brief updates before the President takes questions. First and foremost, we continue to work very closely with governors around the nation. The President I spoke to all the governors all the states and territories yesterday. And since we were last together, the President and I have spoken directly to several governors around the country including Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, New York, and other states.  At the present moment, the President has declared 29 major disaster declarations and authorized ten different states to use full federal funding, so-called Title 32 funding to pay for their National Guard. And as of this afternoon, FEMA reports some 17,000 National Guard have been activated in states around the country to provide support for coronavirus response.  On the subject of testing, we have now completed more than 1.1 million tests around the country. We're working very closely with governors around America to assist them in drive-thru and community testing centers. I spoke with Governor J.B. Pritzker of Illinois today about a testing center that they've established in cooperation with the U.S. public health service.  Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC.

33,FOX,"Former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton joins media in making light of surge of U.S. coronavirus cases; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" March 27, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Three biggest days in the history of the stock market and wants to rebound so badly but we have to get rid of the bug, we have to get rid of the virus. Now I'm going to sign this. And it's a great honor, $6.2 trillion. I've never signed anything with a T on it, I don't know if we can handle this one, Mitch. We can't chicken out this, boy. I don't think so. All right, thank you all.  I want that to be a nice --  (APPLAUSE)  (END VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: Catherine? Come on, folks. Come on over here, Elaine. What a job she's doing with transportation. How's transportation? OK?  ELAINE CHAO, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION: We always talk by the supply chain.  TRUMP: I do.  CHAO: This bill is going to help the supply chain and the workers.  TRUMP: I do. You better believe it. Thank you very much.  Anthony? Thank you. Thanks very much. OK.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you. I appreciate it.  TRUMP: Bob Lighthizer, thank you very much. Bob was a little less involved in this, he was too busy making trade deals. OK? You have one? You definitely have to have one. Go ahead. You're awesome. Thank you, everybody.  So, we are going to have a 5.30 news conference in the same location, it seems to be doing quite well. We appreciate everything and we really appreciate the fairness, at least for most of the press. We really do. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President, Mr. President, it was a rare moment of agreement between you and Senator Kerry over this issue with Massie. Can you expand a bit on that?  TRUMP: Well, he made a little joke about a man named Congressman Massie. I thought he was totally out of line, Congressman Massie. Because of that I guess a lot of people had to come back and they had to go into a place which frankly we're not supposed to be in, you know, in light of what we are doing with Deborah and Tony and all of the professionals.  So, people had to come back and there's just no reason for it. So, John Kerry made a little joke out of it and I agreed with his joke and I said I never knew he had that kind of personality but we actually put it up and he was right. OK. We'll see you in a couple of minutes, folks. Thank you very much. Thank you.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thanks, everybody.  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Another very busy day in Washington, President Trump just signing a $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill into law.  Hello, everyone. I'm Juan Williams, along with Dana Perino, Jesse Watters, Greg Gutfeld, and Emily Compagno. It's five o'clock in New York City, and this is The Five.  We are also awaiting a White House coronavirus task force briefing that set to begin very soon. President Trump teasing a very big announcement about much-needed ventilators. He is also invoking the Defense Protection Act to have General Motors produce more ventilators.  The signing of the stimulus bill comes after more political infighting on Capitol Hill. House Republican Thomas Massie drawing bipartisan fury including from the president after he delayed the process by insisting (AUDIO GAP) over questionable spending including $11 billion for three international development organizations.  Some Democrats also were accusing Republican of putting big corporations ahead of American workers. Watch this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): We have to go into this vote eyes wide open. What did the Senate majority fight for? One of the largest corporate bailouts with as few strings as possible in American history. Shameful.  The greed of that fight is wrong. For crumbs, for our families and the option that we have is to either let them suffer with nothing or to allow this greed and billions of dollars which will be leveraged into trillions of dollars to contribute to the largest income inequality gap in our future.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: Jesse, let me begin with you. Lots of talk about Thomas Massie here in D.C. You heard some of what the president just said in the briefing about Thomas Massie, he said he thought that was -- he didn't approve of what he did, demanding the roll call vote.  On the other hand, you kind of think, well, if you are a conservative the Constitution says that Congress is responsible for spending a nation have a voice vote, everybody should be accountable. Where do you come out?  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Honestly, I don't really care, Juan. I don't care who is on the record on this. I think they could have been done without it. They could have been done with it. It doesn't really matter, they needed to get the money out fast and big and that's what they did.  Everyone pretending like they know what's going to happen with the relief package is either lying or, they are lying. Because no one knows what's going to go on. They didn't know what was going to happen with the bailouts, they didn't know what was going to happen with the stimulus.  You get these moments in history where there is a huge problem and Washington rushes together in a smoke-filled room and just inject billions or in this case trillions of dollars into the economy with kind of their eyes closed and kind of peeking in between their fingers.  Some people are positioning themselves in Washington and saying this is not good enough for your average worker. Some people are just saying this is the kind of fast, direct, big relief we needed in order to get this economy rebounded again. We'll see how it plays out. No one is going to know.  But it reminds me of ""Pulp Fiction."" Remember when Uma Thurman OD's (Ph) and they run into that little house and they draw with a sharpie that little mark on her chest and they take the heroin O.D. and a needle, and Travolta just has to kind of close his eyes and just stab this thing directly into her chest hoping it's going to revive her and that's what they are doing in D.C. They are giving it their best shot with as much juice as possible.  WILLIAMS: So, Greg, speaking -- that was an unbelievable analogy, but I will leave that to Jesse. But I do want to ask you about the idea of, you know, shocking the system back to reality because what we see in the bill is money for people who are workers, unemployed, people who can't work and get a paycheck right now. They've expanded unemployment benefits.  In addition, there's about $1,200 going to all people who earn below, I think it's like $100,000 a year, $500 per child. But that's basically to help us through the next month. It that going to help us, you know, come May?  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: It's a start. I mean, if you are actually complaining that $2 trillion is too little, it's fallen on deaf ears. I'd like to use an analogy from ""Reservoir Dogs.""  WATTERS: OK.  GUTFELD: So, let's say you're the cop, you're tied up in the chair. Now, action. OK. You know, I'm a libertarian. Libertarians has the luxury of standing outside the brawl and wagging their finger.  But in this case, you can't be stepping outside of this and wagging your finger. The libertarian has to suck it up and sit out or realize that this is not a time to be, you know, the principles perfect, you know, be perfect and principled.  If you need to get help the people in need this is what you got to do. Here's what draw makes me laugh. It's like when you were a kid or teenager, or young adult, you use to read in National Geographic or Reader's Digest about a lost tribe still living a primitive lifestyle, untouched by the modern era.  That's our government. I mean, all of us are working from home. They can't vote from home. They still have to come in and do a roll call even though we have one of the most contagious diseases in history running through the population.  Even the signing, when you're watching the signing you're going like, those are all really powerful people, they shouldn't be in that office together. And then you're watching they're debating on the floor and it's like why are they there? And then you have this other guy say well, no, they all have to fly back. They all have to fly back.  It's 2020. Are they in some kind of time capsule from the 1930s? I mean, they really are like a lost tribe that has yet to discover a Coke bottle. There is my analogy.  WATTERS: There it is.  GUTFELD: The ""Gods Must Be Crazy"" analogy.  WILLIAMS: Yes, I like this analogy.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: I like it.  WILLIAMS: So, Dana, you're going to have to come up with a movie here for your question. But I -- what I was driving at with Jesse and Greg is there is already talk in Washington that they are going to have to do something more.  And it seems to me we've already committed such an astounding amount of money given the astounding amount of unemployment but it still may not be enough.  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: It may not but I think that's maybe putting the apple, the cart in front of the horse. The apple cart in front of the horse.  I'm trying to think of a movie. The only movies that I really knew where like the ""Muppet"" movie. And do you remember in the ""Muppet"" movie when -- no, I'm kidding. I can't. I can't come up with the analogy.  But here's the thing. If we have to do it again, remember that this wasn't like what happened in 2008. Where the banks were failing because of the mortgage lending and everything.  Now, in that situation, I know people were mad about it. Like bailing out the banks, but the government actually ended up making money from those banks because within two years the banks paid that money with interest.  So, in this situation the government is telling people, you cannot go to work. And so, the government then has to do something and if it's $2 trillion then that's $2 trillion and then we'll figure it out on the other end. I don't think nitpicking it right now is going to be worth it but you are going to see a lot of it.  I thought it was interesting that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez went so crazy over it on the floor but then didn't object to it and that's partly because I think she realizes that the people she represents in her district are going to need that help.  WILLIAMS: I think that's right. I think that's right. So, Emily, you are governor out in Washington State, Jay Inslee. He and the president had some exchanges. The president says the federal government is there to back up the states. But what Inslee said was, we need Tom Brady, not a backup. Did that get a good reaction in Washington State?  EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS HOST: I don't know. I'm a Raiders fan, remember? Look, my movie analogy for this is ""Footloose."" Which is that you can't have your prom or your dance without a warehouse to hold it in.  So, I want to point out something about the stimulus bill that it delves (Ph), tells in with all of the quarantine a the stay-at-home. Now, a lot of business owners are excited obviously about the loan forgiveness aspect but I want to highlight something about the payroll protection aspect of it.  So, essentially, for there to be actual forgiveness these business owners need to hire back about 90 percent of the workforce that they've laid off. So, unless their doors are open, however, they will be essentially inheriting unemployment wages from the government. It's just transferring those wages that the Fed pays over to the business owner.  So, if you take a restaurant, right, they are doing take out only, they have less hours, they are making 10 percent of their revenue but they are paying a full staff at home. That's just an empty payroll.  PERINO: Right.  COMPAGNO: So, you know, revenue, funds without revenue that's premature at this point. And so, I'm concerned that businesses will accept essentially the funds too early and burned through the limit before the quarantine and the stay-at-home borders are lifted.  GUTFELD: Interesting.  WILLIAMS: Boy, that's a worry. All right. Stay tuned for the White House coronavirus task force briefing, that is set to begin at any moment.  Coming up, the debate raging over President Trump's plan to slowly reopen the American economy. That's next on The Five.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PERINO: The White House coronavirus task force it's going to update the country on the latest efforts to fight the coronavirus and we will bring that to you as soon as it happens. It is a must-see TV and we need this information.  In the meantime, President Trump has received some heavy criticism this week over a potential plan to reopen parts of the country, but even New York Governor, Andrew Cuomo, is having doubts about his state's decision to shutter businesses and encourage people to stay inside.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): If you rethought that or had time to analyze that public health strategy, I don't know that you would say quarantine everyone. I don't even know that that was the best public health policy. It's not we're going to either do public health or we're going to do economic development, development restarting, we have to do both.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: And Dr. Deborah Birx is warning against extreme predictions about the pandemic.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DR. DEBORAH BIRX, WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE COORDINATOR: When people start talking about 20 percent of a population getting infected, it's very scary. But we don't have data that matches that based on the experiences in New York. That there are still ICU beds remaining and there is still significant, over a thousand or 2,000 ventilators that have not been utilized yet.  To wake up this morning and look at people talking about creating DNR situations, do not resuscitate situations for patients, there is no situation in the United States right now that warrants that kind of discussion.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: All right, Greg, do you remember that scene in ""Aliens"" --  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: I'm just kidding, I don't remember that scene really either. I was trying to keep this going.  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: But this -- I want to focus on this do not resuscitate order. So, this is a lot -- this is personal for families. Right? It's a good idea for you as parents to have these discussions, to know what's going on so that your children can make decisions but there is nowhere.  And Dr. Birx pointed out where you actually have to have these discussions right now. She was very frustrated with the media last night.  GUTFELD: Well, there is a lot of -- there is a lot of reasons to be frustrated. First of all, if you ever want to see how bias works compare how they treat somebody they like with someone they don't like when those two people share the same opinion.  So, Cuomo and Trump actually share the same opinion about balancing the prevent -- the tamping down of a pandemic and preserving the future of your economy, they both share the same sentiment.  However, they portrayed Cuomo as, you know, a potential presidential candidate while they say Trump is going to kill World War II veterans which is what as you know morning blow said.  But the idea, everybody understands what's going on but the media pretends that they aren't. We know that this is not a stoplight that goes from red to green, or green to red. We know this is going to be phased. Everybody understands it and this could be face having to do with your health risk. That's how it's going to work.  So, the idea that everybody is -- the media is always looking for a way to divide us even in times when we have to unite.  PERINO: And Jesse, if you think about that scene in ""Top Gun"" when --  WATTERS: Let it go. Damn it. You don't have it. I'm not getting schooled again.  PERINO: Yes. I'm trying so hard. I really need the energy of you guys around me. I'm just sitting here alone, it's like working on these movies and I can't think of anything.  GUTFELD: We're alone too.  PERINO: But Jesse, to Greg, you are alone but we are together.  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: The fact that the governor is being treated differently, I think this is kind of interesting because he is actually saying the same thing. And it's like if you hear it through a different filter, does it sound different?  WATTERS: Yes, because he has a D next to his name and he maybe uses more words to explain it. Greg is right. The media is just scaring people now. It's not going from red to green, there's just a big yellow in between the face up of the economy.  We're not all going back to work and coughing in the air, jamming on to subways and not washing our hands. Putting our arm around our buddy at work, that's not happening. And the media is trying to make it seem like Trump is lifting all of these, these guidelines and just pushing people back into their cubicles in order to kill grandma to juice the Dow.  It's not happening like that and they are doing it to make sound bites and to get padded on the back by the rest of their colleagues but it's really irresponsible.  I do have a little respect for Cuomo who in the middle of a pandemic said, you know what, maybe I made the wrong call? I wouldn't have said that --  PERINO: Right.  WATTERS: -- but I mean, he was brutally honest and a lot of people are going to go back and think about what they did or didn't do. Because a couple weeks ago, de Blasio here in New York was telling everybody go out to dinner.  The head of the health department in Manhattan was saying --  PERINO: Yes.  WATTERS: -- you know, have a parade, life is going to be normal. Let's just live our lives and this is not a big deal. These people look really bad now and it takes a lot of you know what to turn around and point their fingers at Trump at this point.  PERINO: And Emily, from out on the west coast, the perspective from out there, like knowing that this is possibly coming and yet being frustrated because you have all of these people under lockdown. What's the feeling out there about are these measures worth it and are they working?  COMPAGNO: Right. It sort of carries over from our conversation in the last block which is that an economic death is not mutually exclusive from these actual deaths that we are seeing. And they are both interrelated in terms of these choices and decisions that are being made.  And I think, you know, people keep talking about that we are careening into another Great Depression but what we had this time that we didn't have last time was strong federal leadership and action.  So, you know, remember, Roosevelt's new deal in 1932 was the antidote to Hoover's inaction from 1929. And so we have on our side finally a federal government that as Jesse put it as juicy in the Dow, but you know, at least it's making strides to acknowledge that there is a correlation and that you can't acknowledge the economic deaths without recognizing the physical deaths as well.  And I'm not an epidemiologist obviously, but I have to point out that, you know, to Cuomo's point, that Harvard just published this study at their school of public health, that essentially multiple targeted social distancing measures is way more effective than full lockdown quarantine because you have to balance out our herd immunity, too.  And for all of these predictions floating around the one thing people agree on is that at some point there will be a resurgence of this whether it's the fall or next year or both. And so, we need to have a herd immunity to combat that and that's only going to be achieved through relaxing the quarantines and having some type of social interaction.  WATTERS: Yes, if I may, Cuomo is saying maybe it wasn't a good idea to have the children move back in with their parents and their grandparents altogether in a small Manhattan apartment, that's what he's second- guessing.  COMPAGNO: Yes.  WILLIAMS: Yes.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: And Juan, I'm just wondering --  WILLIAMS: I think that's an important point to make.  PERINO: Go ahead.  WILLIAMS: Yes, I was just picking up on what Jesse was saying, I think that's an important distinction. I think the president is much more about how we get the economy back. I don't think Cuomo is quite there, I think he is worried about having sent young people including schoolchildren back home with grandparents who are very vulnerable.  But I think that when you look at the president's idea, I think he is thinking about which regions of the country --  WATTERS: Yes.  WILLIAMS: -- almost by zip codes, if you will, are being less impacted right now. The question I have in my mind, Dana, so if you open let's say, you know, Wyoming, or Colorado, places you're familiar with, but what do you say if somebody from New York says I want to go and spend the next two weeks in Wyoming or Colorado?  I think you would have to say, do we have to have travel restrictions in that situation?  PERINO: Yes  WILLIAMS: How do you make a judgment about who gets reopened --  COMPAGNO: Yes.  WILLIAMS: -- and who doesn't?  GUTFELD: Well, I think that's why there are people together.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: Yes, and I think -- go ahead, Greg.  GUTFELD: You have the great thing about -- the great thing about what's going on right now is you have the very best in medicine and economic powerhouse is working together. That's why this either-or prison of two ideas does not exist.  They'll always going to come to the right conclusion. I have faith in that and I'm seeing that happen. That's why when the media is talking about, he wants them to die. They want to -- don't listen to it. It's just poison for your brain. It's a -- they are -- forging a path.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: And Greg, I think people aren't listening to it.  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: I actually think people aren't listening to it, if you look at what, people like 93 percent of people are socially distancing, they're understanding and they are being very patient, were being like awesome Americans, which we love of course.  OK. We are still awaiting this briefing from President Trump and the coronavirus task force. As soon as that gets going, we'll bring it to you.  But coming up next on The Five, Hillary Clinton and some in the media are mocking President Trump over America leading the world in coronavirus cases. We'll tell you more.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WATTERS: The White House Coronavirus Task Force set to start very soon. And while we wait for that, the liberal media added again. This time they're mocking the president amid the deadly pandemic. And they're even touting the fact that America now has the most cases in the world.  A correspondent for GQ Magazine tweeted out ""who's the S-hole country now?"" CNN's darling Jim Acosta gleefully pointed out, ""the U.S. has just passed China, a country four times larger in population for cases of coronavirus."" The Verge says ""The coronavirus is now the American virus."" And those insults apparently inspiring Hillary Clinton tweet, ""He did promise America First."" Greg, this is bad.  PERINO: It's terrible.  WATTERS: Go for it.  GUTFELD: You know, I can't believe I'm going to say, there are no words for Hillary Clinton. You know, she's totally stole this joke, it's not even a good joke, and the joke is based on the suffering of others. I would say that you should rot in hell, but I think she's already there.  And when you look at -- when you look at people suffering, death -- by the way that the infection rates are increasing because we're testing more. And these are people that really want more testing, so you're naturally going to see more infection rates. But if you see that as an opportunity to direct attention to yourself on social media, you're what scientists would call a scumbag and you're somebody that we will not forget.  When this is all over and done with -- because you don't want to have -- you don't want to say who are the heroes and who were the villains now, we will have plenty of time for that later. She's going to fall on the villain side and I am not going to forget it. I thought maybe I could stop talking about her, but now I'm going to just chase her for the rest of her life.  WATTERS: Dana Perino?  PERINO: Well, her tweet to me was just like, so super irresponsible. Compare that to former Secretary John Kerry's tweet today about Congressman Massie in which President Trump retweeted and said, hey, I actually agree with you. That was pretty funny.  I -- there -- I wish I could remember the name of the writer, but on nationalreview.com, there's a piece about China today that is so important. And if you are a journalist, and you care about freedom of speech, and the rights of journalists, then you should actually be really exposing what China is doing. And you should be very clear that these are the recorded cases in America.  We know that China is not telling the truth. We know that. We know that because the journalists were thrown out. They're treated like crap. They have to like figure out a way to use emojis to get around the censors. So they're not even doing anything to help their fellow journalists.  The other thing is, I read a report today about how China has sent all of these tests to Spain and Italy and elsewhere to help them and the tests are defective. So how can we possibly trust the numbers that are coming out of China? And the other reason that the numbers are not so bad in China right now is they stopped testing.  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: And they don't care about their people. So we do. We are honest about our numbers. We're transparent about it. We should celebrate that and not try to rub it in President Trump's face because we are actually being honest.  WATTERS: Yes, I mean, they try to rub it in Trump's face, they're actually rubbing it in America's face. Emily, what do you think?  COMPAGNO: I just think, you know, these guys are like stuck in a comic book. To Greg's point about the villain, where Trump no matter what will always be the villain. It doesn't matter what is actually happening. But the difference between a comic book and real life is that real life is real life, so he can make good decisions with positive outcomes which we are seeing in this response, right.  Dr. Fauci says he's working closely together. Dr. Birx is tamping down, you know, hyperbolic statistics and predictions to try to calm people feels -- calm that people's fears. But there's no way that the media is going to cover it. And there's certainly no way that Hillary Clinton or everyone else in those media figures are going to acknowledge it whatsoever.  WATTERS: Juan, Bill and Hillary did send thousands of pizzas to the first responders here in Manhattan. So you got to give her credit for that at least, right?  WILLIAMS: Yes. Well, look, I think a lot of this is, you know, sort of facetious behavior, but I still -- I don't think it's appropriate. I think it's reprehensible on some levels because we just don't need it right now. My point here would be you know, when they say that the United States is number one, I don't -- I just want to emphasize, I don't know that we can trust China's numbers. The President says he was talking with the Chinese leader, yes, last night, President Xi.  I don't -- I don't know if he asked him, hey, can we get the actual numbers. Can we know where things are because you know, like right now we're using models from Italy and Europe, but China was way ahead of that? We could have information about how we deal with the cycles, the rise, the fall the spikes, if China would actually be honest with us. And I don't think they've been honest.  So I think that should be the focus here is because that kind of modeling could help us with what we're dealing with at the moment. The facetious comments, you know, some of them over the line, but I just don't think it's worth the time.  WATTERS: Yes, I think we all agree on that.  WILLIAMS: I mean, President Trump makes crazy statements.  GUTFELD: No, really not. I've never heard that argument.  WATTERS: Not in that same way. President Trump though teasing a big announcement coming up at the Coronavirus Task Force briefing. In the meantime, stick around for the ""FASTEST SEVEN.""  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  COMPAGNO: Welcome back. The White House Coronavirus Task Force briefing is set to start at any moment. While we wait for that, it's time for the ""FASTEST SEVEN."" First up, the coronavirus pandemic has gyms closed and people confine to their homes. So naturally, we're all worried about ways to stay fit and healthy in isolation.  Now you guys, I am lucky because my best friend happens to be an amazing fitness instructor. And she's been doing all of these like amazing online classes for free. I put it on my story on Instagram if anyone wants to go and check her out. Dana and Greg, however, I have a feeling that you guys have a certain bike apparatus at home that's been keeping you busy.  GUTFELD: Wait a second. No one is supposed to know about that.  PERINO: I'm so glad I got the Peloton. We only talk about it every day. I'm so glad that I have it because I just checked. I wasn't just looking at my phone. I -- 768 steps today in five floors, even though I don't carry my phone with me up and down the stairs. I mean, if I didn't have the bike, who knows what would -- I don't know what I would do. I'm going to go for a walk after the show though.  GUTFELD: You know what?  PERINO: I'm going to go get some fresh air. I need a break.  GUTFELD: I'm not worried about weights. The only thing that keeps growing is my hair. I have to get a haircut. So we have no hair and makeup here. I'm doing my own makeup which is why I look like -- I don't know, I look like George Hamilton.  PERINO: It looks pretty good.  GUTFELD: I look like I should be -- I look like Robert Culp from like 19 -- from the I spy era. I look like I should be hanging out at the Playboy Mansion hitting on girls who are like 18. I look like I should be selling Lamborghinis on Beverly drive. And the hair is just insane.  WATTERS: Greg, should I tell people what you said about the makeup in the greenroom?  GUTFELD: Sure, go ahead. I don't care.  WATTERS: Greg says he likes doing his own makeup.  GUTFELD: I do because it makes me feel pretty.  WATTERS: He says he enjoys it.  GUTFELD: It's therapeutic because you can't -- you can't think about anything but putting stuff on your face, and so that kind of like --  WATTERS: Greg likes doing his own makeup.  GUTFELD: Yes, I do.  WATTERS: That's the headline, everybody.  GUTFELD: I'm man --  COMPAGNO: I think that's great.  GUTFELD: I'm man enough to admit it.  COMPAGNO: Exactly. I think that's great.  PERINO: What movie was that?  COMPAGNO: Let's get to topic two. Oh -- next up with sports shuttered around the country, people are finding all kinds of other things to bet on, like how many times President Trump will say these words at the Task Force briefings.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: And we're doing tremendous work.  Incredible.  Fantastic job.  Amazing.  Tremendous.  Amazing.  Incredible.  Fantastic.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  COMPAGNO: All right Juan, what is your money on? Have you been making those bets?  WILLIAMS: No, I think people have a lot of disposable income and they got a lot of energy and nothing to do with it because there's no sports around. So, I think you know, if you have to -- if it's entertaining, it's fun, go for it. Do whatever you can. Although I guess, with the high rate of unemployment we've seen, you got to be careful about that money for a lot of people but I think it's fun.  By the way, when it comes to exercise, I've been doing the walks with my wife and she's been doing my makeup so high five to the wife. And the other thing is, I discovered a high school track yesterday so I ran a mile on the track which was surprisingly open. I was -- I was so pleased. And the other thing is bottles of water that are used for the water fountain in my house, I now use those as weights.  GUTFELD: Oh, very good.  COMPAGNO: Oh, that's smart. That's like prison-style, Juan. Jesse, what about you? Have you been --  WATTERS: Well, I just got the bow flex. You know those little like units and you dial it and you can work out like that. So I'm getting pretty --  PERINO: Peter got that.  WATTERS: Yes.  COMPAGNO: I didn't know that still existed.  WATTERS: Also, we got those little ab rollers where you get on your knees and you roll out.  GUTFELD: No you don't.  WATTERS: And then you roll in. Oh, yeah, they're working like a charm. The gains are unreal. Also, I got these little like handlebars for the push-ups so you can go down really deep. You guys aren't even going to recognize me in few days.  GUTFELD: I hope so.  COMPAGNO: You guys, on the other side of this, we're all going to be like awesome prison buddies. All right, we are awaiting an update from the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Stay with us. In the meantime, ""FAN MAIL FRIDAY"" is up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: ""FAN MAIL FRIDAY,"" we're answering your questions. First one from Genevieve. That's a great name. What movie and or TV shows are you watching now that you have to stay home? That's a good question. Dana, what are you watching?  PERINO: Well, we just finished watching Wild, Wild Country on Netflix. It was a documentary about a --  GUTFELD: A sex cult. It's about a cult.  PERINO: Yes. in Oregon.  GUTFELD: Dana, a sex cult in Oregon.  PERINO: It was not scandalous.  WATTERS: If it's about a sex cult, Greg has seen it.  PERINO: But you know what?  GUTFELD: Yes, Dana, but --  PERINO: The FBI was fabulous in that. The FBI was great.  GUTFELD: Yes, there was -- Rajneesh, right?  PERINO: But I watch -- I watch that. And then last night, we just called friends. Rajneesh, yes.  GUTFELD: Yes, got it. What about you, Juan? What are you watching?  WILLIAMS: I'm watching -- I guess it's on Netflix. It's called Gentefied. It's about Latino family in East LA. They run a taco shop but the neighborhood is changing and they're having to make changes to try to attract new customers. But it's a real interesting look inside a family's life.  And then we watched a rom-com which was like my five favorite boyfriends or something. And I actually, you know, in these tense times, I enjoyed it. I was like, I don't need you know, Bruce Willis jumping off a tower right now. I'm just like, let's have some you easy times on the couch, you know.  GUTFELD: I could tell you, if you're saying it's speaking good of romantic comedies, you've -- you got to get outside, Juan. Emily, what about you?  COMPAGNO: OK, so I am revisiting the entire Twilight Saga.  GUTFELD: Oh, my God. No.  COMPAGNO: Yes. And also -- yes, yes. I love it. And then --  GUTFELD: Seriously? Twilight? It's my favorite.  COMPAGNO: Yes. You guys. I always -- I always talk about this. You shouldn't be surprised.  GUTFELD: You guys.  COMPAGNO: And also, we are watching The Outsider, Stephen King's on Netflix or whatever which I think we're kind of late to the game but obviously that makes me terrified which is why I have to balance out also with the Hallmark Channel.  GUTFELD: Yes. Jesse, what are you watching?  WATTERS: Em and I are Julia Roberts phase right now. So we've watched Pretty Woman and Sleeping With The Enemy.  GUTFELD: That's interesting.  WATTERS: Say it. Just say it.  GUTFELD: I don't know what to say. I'm watching just old Chuck Heston movies, because that's what I always -- I'm watching the Omega Man. Remember Omega Man, Planet of the Apes, Soylent Green. Those are good movies for this time. They start eating each other at the end. Anyway, that's not going to happen with America. We'll be back to work before we get that bad.  All right. Are you enjoying -- this is a great question. Are you enjoying social distancing more or less than you thought you would and why? What about you, Jesse?  WATTERS: My life hasn't changed that much to be honest with you. I really - - I always kind of hung out at the apartment and prepped for the show, and worked out, and came in to work in the afternoon. So --  GUTFELD: Prep? You don't prep. By the way, you know what you like about this? You have fewer people throwing things that you on the subway.  WATTERS: That is true. And I will never take the subway again after this.  GUTFELD: Yes. And an excuse not to come in early.  WATTERS: Right.  GUTFELD: Emily, do -- are you --  COMPAGNO: I loved it --  GUTFELD: Go ahead.  COMPAGNO: I loved it way more than I thought I would. But I like deeply, deeply miss my family and that like physical connection with them. But that being aside, I totally love it. I just feel like the world is quiet and I spent all my time outside with the dog when I can so it's kind of bliss.  GUTFELD: Juan, do you like it more than you thought you would? Your way for me.  WILLIAMS: You know, no. Hey look, I tell you, I think human beings are social animals. I think we thrive on it and ideas pop and you know, sometimes you have disagreement. But you know what, I'm just a social animal. And I also think that it's interesting, I find myself like being told don't go near that person. I'm like, but I want to see them. I just want to talk or I miss the grandkids, obviously. I miss my family.  You know, one daughter in law's the doc, so we can't go near her, that kind of thing. I don't like it that on that level.  GUTFELD: I love -- Dana, I have to say, I love being able to say I can't come near you. I love doing that. Like, hey, sorry. Like, you know what? This is -- like when you have neighbors, you go, oh, I'd love to come, but we can't. This is like when -- Curb Your Enthusiasm, when they talked about the MAGA hat being -- keeping people away. It's actually this is the way to do it.  PERINO: Yes. You just like -- just like wearing a coronavirus hat around, Greg, and everything will be great.  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: I actually -- I miss you guys. I miss being with you. I'm glad that we could -- I'm glad that we could get to work and we get to do the show, but I do live our camaraderie. I missed the commercial breaks. But I love this the forced pause of having more time with Peter and Jasper and being a little bit quieter and yes, I really like it. You know, you always tell me I say yes to too many things.  COMPAGNO: You're right.  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: Now I know.  GUTFELD: Finally you listen to me. OK, ""ONE MORE THING"" is up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WILLIAMS: The Fox News alert. President Trump and the White House Coronavirus Task Force now holding their briefing. Let's listen.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  TRUMP: And thank you all for being here. My administration is taking new action to ensure that America has the medical resources and equipment needed to fight the global pandemic. It's been a brutal pandemic for over 150 countries all over the world. We've had great success over the last month. We've, as you know, the millions and millions of pieces of equipment have been delivered successfully by us, purchased and delivered. And we've made it available to the states. And the governors have been very gracious for the most part, I would say. There a couple that aren't appreciative for the incredible job. They have to do a better job themselves. That's part of the problem.  But generally speaking, I have to tell you, the governors have been great. I just spoke to the governor of New Jersey, Governor Murphy, and he's very thankful. And Governor Cuomo has been very nice. They really appreciated I think what the federal government has done. When you look at the hospitals that are being built all over the country by the Army Corps of Engineers and FEMA, it's been really incredible. Nobody has seen it. They'll build hospitals in two or three days, portable hospitals.  This afternoon, I invoke the Defense Production Act, to compel General Motors to accept, perform, and prioritize federal contracts for ventilators. Ventilators are a big deal, and we've delivered thousands of them. And oftentimes, you don't need ventilators very much. Hospitals don't have very many. And now we're turning out that we have to produce large numbers. But we've been able to do that and we're going to be doing a lot more.  This invocation of the DPA should demonstrate clearly to all that we will not hesitate to use the full authority of the federal government to combat this crisis. We thought that we had to deal with this. As an example, General Motors and I guess they thought otherwise, they didn't agree, and now they do. They do agree and I think we might be able to pull it, but we let them know the way we felt, and they can't be doing that.  We'll work in partnership with the private sector but where an emergency exists, and it's very important that we get to the bottom line and quickly. We will do what we have to do and immediately exercise all available lawful authorities to get the job done.  This afternoon, I also signed an executive order investing and very, very strongly investing the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Homeland Security, with the full authorities available under the Defense Production Act, to respond to the outbreak of the terrible virus, the invisible enemy, as we say.  My order also establishes that Peter Navarro, a very trusted person from the White House, and he's been an incredible -- he's done an incredible job for me in terms of negotiation, in terms of understanding where the world is going economically. But my order establishes that Peter will serve as National Defense Production Act Policy Coordinator for the federal government. That's a very important position. More important, probably than it's almost ever been in our country.  And so I want to congratulate Peter and his family. It's -- he's -- I know he's going to do a fantastic job. He's been doing that job over the last few weeks. Peter is a Ph.D. in Economics from Harvard, has a master's in public administration from the Kennedy School, also from Harvard, and he's a tremendous guy and he will do a fantastic job. And I'd like to maybe ask before I continue, Peter, just say a few words, please. Peter?  Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

34,FOX,"Some journalists push back against airing President Trump's coronavirus briefings; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" March 26, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: We'll be also looking at this tomorrow with New York Cardinal Dolan (Inaudible). And now, in the middle of this, you can't go to church. You could still pray. A nation is. Here we go.  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everybody. I am Jesse Watters, along with Juan Williams, Dana Perino, Greg Gutfeld, and Dagen McDowell. It is 5:00 in New York City, and this is The Five. Breaking news from the White House, at any moment, President Trump will be holding a Coronavirus task force briefing. He is expected to address a plan to slowly reopen parts of the economy.  The federal government working on publishing new safety guidelines for states and will classify counties as either high, medium, or low risk, of spreading the virus. We're expecting a lot more news on that. Plus, much needed relief could soon be coming to Americans. After a record three million workers filed unemployment claims, the Senate unanimously passing $2 trillion Coronavirus stimulus package.  The House is expected to vote on it tomorrow. And after delaying the bill for days with their wish list, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is now attacking Republicans for what's in it.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): We did jiu-jitsu on it that it went from a corporate first proposal to Republicans put forth in the Senate, to a workers' first Democratic workers' first legislation. Can you believe that almost -- I think was -- every Republican -- 49 Republicans last night voted in the Senate to deprive those on unemployment insurance of the additional $600 a week.  How could it be? We want more. There are so many things we didn't get in any of these bills yet in the way that we need to.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: All right. So Mr. Gutfeld, we have millions of Americans filing for unemployment. And it looks like some of the money -- you know, if you are married with a few kids, you're going to get a couple thousand dollar check in the mail in about three weeks. Is it going to be enough? Are you just too out of touch because you are so successful that you have no idea?  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Probably that. No, I just -- the idea of Pelosi pointing her finger at anybody, she was pushing arts funding in the middle of a pandemic. That is like demanding a haircut during a tsunami. She is completely wrong and out of it. The 3.2 million jobless numbers is a reminder to all of us here on TV that we are here -- telling you stay at home.  And we are complaining that we can't go to a restaurant or, you know, hear Schwarzenegger lecturing you from his hot tub or that the NBA might be delayed, or that the sequels to your favorite movies might come out on time. There are millions of people at home because of the decisions that we want to make. I mean, these decisions are to stop a pandemic. But we cannot pretend for a minute that there aren't consequences.  There are people out of work who are going to be suffering. And that is why we need a phased return to the economy, which the media has been lying about. It's not about getting -- letting old people die. It's about getting the young and the healthy and the people who are disease-free back into the workplace in specific areas of the country.  So you can protect grandma and grandpa, so they can stay home and not worry and maybe self-distance until they can later come out. So that's what I hope we're going to be doing soon.  WATTERS: Yeah. That is something that MSNBC has been talking about, Juan. I think it's kind of a false dichotomy. Here's Joe Scarborough making the argument that Greg referenced. Listen to this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It seems that Republicans that are making the argument. Let the World War II vets die. Let the Korean War vets die. Let the Vietnam vets die. Let everybody in that generation die, because we are worried about Boeing. It is the born (ph). It is the weakest among us. It is senior citizens who they are ready to euthanize, because they want Boeing's corporate earnings to not to dip too low.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: Now, Juan, you don't really believe that, do you?  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: No. I said to you yesterday, Jesse. I think the president spoke to it explicitly when he said that zero deaths are acceptable. And I hope that he feels that in his heart. He has been pushing to reopen despite the advice coming from the scientists and the doctors. And again, I would -- you know, I think they are the people we should be listening to right now.  I think we are not in an ultimate economic crisis at the moment. I think we are in a tremendous, you know, once in a lifetime type of health emergency. And by the way, I think by dealing with the pandemic, we help the economy. If we go back too soon and we have to repeat this, I think there will be a problem for our economy, because consumer confidence will not return.  And therefore, the spending won't be there. So that's why I think when I see this jobs number, to me it's cataclysmic. It's shocking, because it's not just the 3.3 million. You are talking about everybody else in that family. You are talking about the kids. You are talking about the grandparents. So to me, when we see the Democrats make an effort and it took some delay delays.  You guys have pointed out to put families and the people who are being put out of work first, to put small businesses first, and to say that when it comes to big business, to the big corporations, the Wall Street types, you guys are going to have to be transparent. You can't use this for buybacks and executive --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: I think that's exactly right. We need to get this bill right and not be involved in a lot of recrimination about too big to fail as what happened, you know, back in 08, 09.  WATTERS: Dana, so Nancy says that she did jiu-jitsu on this thing. What specifically is going to claim credit for doing if this becomes a very successful relief package?  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, I think the spin from the Democrats has been pretty good, although it's a little galling. Let me just tell you that I think that the actual things that are in the bill for the $500 billion to keep employers from laying-off employees. How is that not pro-worker? To me, that's pro-worker. I also -- on the buy back thing.  I can read the Wall Street Journal just as well as anybody else. And that it's just -- it's false the way that that's been portrayed. But let me tell you couple of things that Nancy Pelosi wanted to get in the bill and didn't. She wanted a mandated vote by mail. They wanted $4 billion for that.  WATTERS: Billion?  PERINO: Four hundred million dollars was that -- that was OK, billion, OK? They got $400 million. They wanted to ban voter ID laws in some states in this bill. That doesn't make sense.  WATTERS: Right.  PERINO: All right? They wanted to have fuel standards for vehicles and planes. They wanted collective bargaining power. How is that going to help people? They wanted -- and then this whole idea also about the pay raises for Congress. That's not in the bill either, right? The $25 million is to go to help them try to figure out how to tele-work while we are socially distanced.  And whether you think $25 million is too much, whatever. But I think that Nancy Pelosi is claiming credit for things that she actually doesn't deserve credit for. And actually, the Republicans were able to strip out things that we would be screaming about if they were in the bill when it passes tomorrow.  WATTERS: Dagen, the stock market likes it. In the last three days, I think 20 percent of the market came back. What are you hearing on the street?  DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, I am hearing from the people who are unemployed who need the unemployment benefits in this bill. And by the way, this was written by the White House and Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, who negotiated with the Senate. So this is Nancy Pelosi gasping for relevancy, because she got iced out of this deal getting put together.  And she's trying to put her tiny little fingerprints all over it. But secondly, these are people who are unemployed and these are businesses. Half of the jobs in this country are with small and medium sized businesses. These are businesses that got shutdown overnight to fight a virus. And these are people who millions of them and millions more laid-off to fight a virus.  And you have to rescue both, because employees need employers. People who work need a place to go and work. And I just hope that these idiots in Congress do some online course work while they're at home, not helping anybody about how the Federal Reserve works, because this $450 billion, roughly that is going to the Treasury Department. It's not a slush fund.  It will actually be used to backstop loans made by the Federal Reserve, to guess what, businesses in this country. And so for every dollar the Treasury gets, the Fed can lend $10. So that's how leverage works. This is basics. I think Pat Toomey might be the only person in the Senate who understands this. So I hope the idiots go back to online school when -- while they are sitting at home not helping anybody.  GUTFELD: Hey, Jesse. I -- to quick things, how is the media going to express legitimate concern over the 3.28 million newly unemployed when they demonize other people for expressing that same adult concern? They have -- like Dagen says, they have no expertise in cost-benefit-analysis. Secondly, that's the first time I saw that Joe Scarborough clip. And that is mind- blowing.  I think we kind of let him off a little easy. When he said that the administration wants World War II vets to die, that we want to euthanize vets, this guy, Scarborough is a nut-bag. And he has been on the wrong side of everything. If his terrible batting average had been in any other kind of employment other than TV commentary, he would not be employed.  It's only in our employment -- in our commentary world that an idiot like Joe Scarborough could still make a living.  WATTERS: You know, it's interesting what you said about the media's sympathy towards people that are filing for unemployment, because that's what the president has been so concerned about is the massive amounts of people being laid-off. And he's been hit by that same media for expressing those concerns. And now, they're pulling their --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: Everyone is concerned about that, Juan. You can be concerned about people getting laid-off and people getting sick. It doesn't have to be either or.  WILLIAMS: Right. But I'm saying what do you think this whole fight was about for the entire week over this bill? It was Democrats pushing back against the idea that there was a lack of transparency for this $500 billion that was being made available to these big corporations without the promise that they would not fire people, without the promise that there would be some transparency.  Accountability for how the administration used the money. And it wouldn't simply be amount rewarding their political favorites, the cronyism.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: So everyone gets credit?  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: No. I am just saying if Democrats had not fought, this bill would not be about making sure that those people who filed in record numbers for unemployment were getting it.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: They fought for that and then they fought for the Green New Deal, OK? We get it, Juan. They used it as a bargaining chip.  WILLIAMS: So energy renewable jobs, forget about it?  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: You want to reduce emissions. Let's get one thing first done, and then we can worry about gases.  GUTFELD: Yeah.  MCDOWELL: Speaking of gases, we're going to stop talking about Congress and start talking about the media. We are still waiting for a briefing from President Trump and the White House Coronavirus task force. Initially, the media had been complaining about a lack of those very briefings. But now, they almost -- they're almost a daily presence in our lives.  But momentum is building to stop airing these briefings. The New York Times with this headline, quote, ""Trump's briefings are a ratings hit. Should networks cover them live?"" And some in the media say we should not show them at all.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If it were up to me, and it's not, I would stop putting those briefings on live TV. Not out of spite, but because it's misinformation.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: These briefings are substitutes for the rallies. There's no question there. It's his outlet. It's his ability to stay on stage. He knows he can dominate the newscast.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There is also -- Trump using this as a political platform to promote the messages that he is not able to promote at rallies, because he can't hold rallies right now.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  MCDOWELL: Here's President Trump clashing with the media.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Just so you'll understand. Are you ready? I think there are certain people that would like it not to open so quickly. I think there's certain people that would like it do financially poorly, because they think that would be very good as far as defeating me at the polls. I think it's very clear that there are people in your profession that write fake news.  You do. She does. We've done one hell of a job. Nobody has done the job that we've done. And it's lucky that you have this group here right now for this problem.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  MCDOWELL: Dana, I'm going to you first -- worked at the White House, the insanity of is, is they don't want the American people to hear from the president of the United States live in the greatest crisis of our lives. That's how nuts this is.  PERINO: Yeah. I don't really understand how somebody's political analysis of the president's briefing is more important than the president's briefing, while he is, you know, basically commanding the ship. And I know that a lot of them don't like it that President Trump is the president, but he is the president. And he is the one that is entrusted in making decisions that have to do with our livelihoods and our health.  And the thing that he has done is surround himself with people at those briefings that also take questions. They have never seen anything like this, where you could have a briefing the last 2.5 hours. I mean, maybe that's part of the frustration for the media. They want to see their own faces on TV. But here's the thing.  There are a lot of great places, including here at Fox News, where you can get the full information. If your local station or your local radio decides not to cover it, have got a place to go.  MCDOWELL: Greg, just -- talk about the fact that these individuals would rather hear themselves speak than a president providing information to all Americans who care about their health and their loved ones.  GUTFELD: Incompetent people fear competition, because the competition exposes their own idiocy. For exam -- this is not a -- this argument should sound familiar to anybody who worked at Fox. Because you are successful, don't air them. That was the same argument when Fox News came up, because if you can't beat them, get rid of them. And that's the whole thing.  So Trump gets on the air. We all know that if he -- he is a ratings winner. We saw that. That's how CNN and Morning Joe elected him. They put him on their air all the time. And then he became president, and now they're, like, how dare he? Well, they should cover him, because he happens to be the commander-in-chief during a pandemic.  You know what? CNN.com reported on -- Meghan Markle is forbidding Prince Harry from visiting his father. That's what they're covering.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: But the pandemic briefing, forget that.  MCDOWELL: Juan, you've been a lifelong newsman. You can't be in favor of this.  WILLIAMS: Well, I think he is the president. And so I always think you have got to cover what the president has to say. But I -- he has turned this into basically a political rally event. It's the Trump show. So everyday, he gets this Trump show platform. And he does deliver a lot of misinformation. He's, you know, when he's asked how he is doing, he is doing perfectly.  It's as perfect as the call to the Ukrainian president. When he's asked about Governor Cuomo --  (CROSSTALK)  MCDOWELL: I see what you did there.  (CROSSTALK)  MCDOWELL: I see what you did.  WILLIAMS: Hang on. Let me finish.  MCDOWELL: I see what you did.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Hang on a second. Hang on. Hang on. Hang on a second, Dagen. Dagen, he said that. I didn't say that. He said it was as perfect as his phone call to the Ukrainians. And he says things like we've caught up totally with the testing, with regard to South Korea, when in fact, south - - we're far behind. South Korea is a much smaller country than we are.  I think they've tested like 1 out of every 150 people. We've tested 1 out of every 900, and we are way behind. So he says all these things. People come to these briefings for real information. And instead, they are getting a political presentation. And I think that's why a lot of people say, yes, he is the president.  You have got to make sure the American people have access to what he is saying. But now, the question arises. As a journalist, are we supposed to just say whatever he says is fine?  MCDOWELL: No.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: -- only person left on the Earth that takes Trump word for word. What he is trying to do is present optimism. And Fauci is the good cop. He is the good cop. Fauci is the bad cop. They both want the same thing. But you're acting like this is 2016 all over again, where when he says something, it's directionally true.  Sometimes, he gets some little things wrong. But the American public actually understands it. It's only inside the beltway journalists who are always wrong on this. And that's why you are always so far behind on the real stories.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Because you sit there and you just --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: I think the real story is that the people want leadership they can trust.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: I think that's why Dr. Fauci ha -- they are not getting it from Trump. They get it from Fauci. They get from Dr. Birx.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: So Trump is doing a terrible job, Juan?  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: No. Trump's doing a bang-up job of putting on a TV show that gets great ratings.  GUTFELD: There you go. You just can't do it, can you, Juan? You can't admit a little bit.  MCDOWELL: Jesse?  (CROSSTALK)  MCDOWELL: Let Jesse get in here.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: The media worrying about misinformation is like the mafia worrying about crime. Look in the mirror. CNN lied for two years. We should take them off the air. Come on. This is what they are worried about. President Trump has turned the media into C-SPAN. That's all they are now. They point a camera and they take live press conferences.  And they can't add their analysts and their pundits and reporters to spin it, slice and dice it, and edit it, and put special sauce, and serve it to the public. They get stuff wrong now. And the American people are in the mood for raw material. And they don't want anymore spin. The media thinks that they are smarter than the president.  And they have to point out every little time that they think they are smarter and they got him. But that's not true, because the American public trusts the president more than they trust the media. They like him more. And it's because he is more compelling. He is more honest and he's more straightforward. And that's the truth.  Because when he goes up there, you are not only getting a real face-to-face reality. You are getting a man that is pretty entertaining. And that can speak in solid gold sound bites that every American can understand. They are jealous of him. They don't have anybody on those networks that can compete with that kind of talent. They don't have it in Hollywood.  They don't have it at CNN. They don't have it anywhere. And instead of realizing the deficiency and trying to work on improving their performance, they are trying to censor the president of the United States. How insane is that? If you want to fact-check him, Juan, fact-check him afterwards when you have the 13 little boxes on the screen like we do right now.  Fact-check him all day long, but don't cut him off in the middle of a press conference.  MCDOWELL: Dana, go ahead.  WILLIAMS: I think he's the one who is trying to take our time, Jesse. Say we're jealous of him. I think he's trying to impose himself on the news coverage.  WATTERS: This is the American people's time.  WILLIAMS: There is no filter.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: If you have a political leader who is just, like, spouting at the American people, you know, at some point you got to wonder, is that propagandistic?  WATTERS: Juan, reporters are asking great questions, and we are getting great answers. And some of the questions are so good. The task force is going back and saying oh, I didn't thought about it that way and they delivering more news about that same question the next day. It's helping the American people.  PERINO: OK. This is what I was going to say, is that when the president tweeted around 5:00 o'clock that he would be on -- around 5:10 and they're going to focus on this question of the what are these guidelines going to be that will tell people -- state governments, local government, companies, workers. You can bet people want to tune into that, because they're going to talk about what are the guidelines going to be.  How are we going to get people back to work? How are going to do this responsibly and with sensitivity and maybe with some technology? It's possible that we are going to be able to have this finger-prick test soon that would tell people you've it. Maybe you're immune now. And now, you can go back to work. There's also going to be the possibility of doing, like, in South Korea, where you get your temperature taken before you were allowed into the workplace or a shop if you wanted to buy groceries.  Like, they're going to provide information that is actually really vital. So I can't imagine people not wanting to take this press conference, this one in particular coming up, because this is the beginning of the president laying out how we are going to get back to work in a responsible way.  MCDOWELL: These are people who want to shut the president down who lied about Russia collusion for literally years. And now, they are playing doctor on television. That's what they are doing. They -- again, they learned their medical knowledge from Fletch. That's how smart they are.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: Fletch, that's a throwback.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: President Trump and the Coronavirus task force briefing is going to start any moment now, so stay with us. But in the meantime, hospitals in the outbreaks epicenter, which as you know is New York City, they're being overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients and cases in the state, now top 37,000 people. One hospital in the city, a single hospital, folks, is reporting 13 deaths within 24 hours.  Doctors are warning of apocalyptic type conditions. And healthcare workers now saying they don't have enough protective gear. Some nurses forced to wear trash bags, trash bags, to keep themselves safe. And in Boston, local news outlets reporting more than 100 hospital workers have, in fact, contracted the virus. I think what we're seeing now, Dana, is this thing is, you know, spreading into areas of the country that previously weren't being hit.  I noticed particularly in the south, New Orleans, they are saying they are having just a surge of virus confirmations. How do you take that?  PERINO: Well, I think that it is showing what Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx have been telling us for weeks is coming true. Like, we know that the social distancing is having an impact to try to slow the rate of people that need hospitalization. So that's good. One of the reasons to take the president's briefings is I believe it was just yesterday or the day before.  That the president announced he was allowing the major disaster declaration for Louisiana or the emergency declaration, because that allows some funds to get there for what they're going to need. And different states are going to have different problems. Louisiana, one of the problems was big parties at Mardi Gras, OK?  So we know that that's a highly dense situation. Now, take up it there in Wyoming, where my family is from. Like, this is not there, at least yet. And it's not overwhelming the situation yet. But that governor also ordering stay at home now, so you this phase coming, and you can also hopefully start to see after this briefing then what does the other side look like?  So I think it all is going according to how Fauci and Birx have been telling the president from the beginning it was going to go.  WILLIAMS: And Jesse, what do you think about the hospital workers? You know, the poor people having to go to work that they don't have the proper garb so they are putting on garbage bags. And now, there's the question, you know, do the nurses, the doctors, all of the people who make things happen at the hospital keep going to work or do they say, hey, we can't handle it?  WATTERS: Well, I hope they don't stop going to work, because that's the best we have right now, Juan. Governor Cuomo says that they have enough equipment right now for the hospitals. I guess maybe there is disconnect, because you've obviously seen pictures of people with that type of garb. I spoke to a guy today who is a doctor at Cornell Medical up in New York City.  And he says he is confident now. And here's why. He knows how to not get Coronavirus. And he is on the frontlines. He says one of the biggest mistakes you can make is touching your face. He says if you do everything to avoid touching your face that is the number one way to transmit something. You touch someone. You shake their hand. You touch a surface, and you haven't been purling.  Or you're in a small room with someone for 30 to 45 minutes who is infected, and then you touch your face. That is the number one way that this thing gets transmitted. So you have got to stop touching your face. And you have to carry Purell around everywhere. And you have to really watch out what surfaces you're touching.  But with that knowledge, everybody can social-distance and stay clean. And that's how we're going to get this thing solves eventually.  MCDOWELL: I just want to --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Hey, Greg, what do you think -- oh, go ahead, Dagen, sorry.  MCDOWELL: I just quickly want to point out. One of my friends is working in an emergency room. And they think he actually got double pneumonia from Coronavirus, like, several weeks ago and wasn't diagnosed with it. And these people are putting their lives on the line to save New Yorkers. And they would gladly do it for every single American. Never forget that.  GUTFELD: Just -- I just want to add before the president comes out, a very important question. Who are the patients that are dying? Were they previously healthy, young patients? And did they receive any of the Hydroxychloroquine plus the antibiotics? Because I'm interested in knowing has anybody died from that drug?  Because I haven't heard it, all I've heard, anecdotally from doctors, is that when you get that drug, you get better. So you got to demand that. If you have symptoms, you've got to talk to your doctor. We don't know anything about the patients that are succumbing.  WILLIAMS: Greg, this is a Fox News alert. President Trump and the White House Coronavirus task force holding a briefing. Let's listen in.  TRUMP: -- what you're doing. Look at all of those empty seats. Never seen it like that, oh, boy. Well, how the world has changed. How the world has changed, right? But it's going to end up being better than ever. I want to thank you very much for being here. And I would like to update you on the steps we are taking on our ongoing fight to defeat the virus.  This morning, at 7:55, I spoke to the leaders of the G20. We had a great meeting. And we have a lot of different ideas, a lot of good ideas. We're working together. The leaders gathered virtually around the world to discuss the whole subject of the problem that right now 151 nations have got. We have President Alberto Fernandez of Argentina, Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia.  President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, President Xi of China, President Emmanuel Macron of France. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, Prime Minister Modi of India, President Widodo of Indonesia, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, of Italy, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. Congratulations to Japan on making a great decision on the Olympics.  They'll make it next year, 2021. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador of Mexico, I want to thank the president of Mexico for having done such a great job with respect to the military. We have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our southern border, and very few people are getting through. I can tell you that. We have to keep it that way. And we have a great relationship with Mexico now.  President Putin of Russia, King Solomon of Saudi Arabia. President Ramaphosa of South Africa, President Moon of, as you know, a country that we spend a lot of time in, South Korea. We are working very hard on that. Prime Minister Sanchez of Spain, President Erdogan of Turkey. Prime Minister Boris Johnson of the United Kingdom, President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Council Charles Michel, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, World Health Organization Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, World Bank President David Malpass, and the International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva.  So that's a big group, but it's a great group. It's -- and they were all there, every one of them. We talked about the problem and hopefully won't be a problem for too much longer. The United States is working with our friends and partners around the world to stop the spread of the virus and coordinate our efforts.  We discussed how vitally important it is for all of our nations to immediately share information and data. And we've been doing that to a large extent, but we'll do it even more so. And to inform our -- I guess you could say, for each of us on the fight that we've got going one way or the other, it's a little bit different, but we're handling it a little bit in different ways, but there is great uniformity. I think we had a -- it was a terrific meeting. Tremendous spirit, among all of those countries, yet 20 countries plus the other people that I mentioned and a tremendous spirit to get this over with.  After the meeting with the world leaders, I spoke with the governors of our 50 states and territories. Our team has been in constant communication with the governors and we had a -- we had a terrific meeting. Somebody in the fake news said that one of the governors said, oh, we need Tom Brady. I said yes, he meant that in a positive way. He said, we need Tom Brady. We're going to do great and he meant it very positively, but they took it differently. They think Tom Brady should be leading the effort. That's only fake news. And I like Tom Brady. I spoke to him the other day. He's great guy.  But I wish the news could be -- could be real. I wish it could be honest. I wish it weren't corrupt. But so much of it is. It's so sad to say, just so sad to say. We had a great meeting. I tell you what, I'm sure you have tapes of the meeting. I'm sure that you were able to get tapes very easily, see it, 50 governors plus. And maybe you had tapes, you'd say it was really -- I mean, there was no contention. I would say virtually none.  I would say maybe one person that was a little tiny bit of a raising of a voice, a little wise guy, a little bit. But he was usually a big wise guy, not so much anymore. We saw to it that he wouldn't be so much anymore. But he is -- we had it -- I mean, I would rate -- Mike was there. A lot of the folks at the back were there, and it was a -- it was a great meeting. It took place at about 12:00.  So we went from the G-20, to the governors. We also spoke about the economic relief with the governors and the package that we're moving through Congress to deliver much needed financial assistance to hard- working families and small businesses. I want to thank Democrats and Republicans in the Senate for unanimously passing the largest financial relief package in American history, 96 to zero. And I have to say, it's the largest by far. And I'm profoundly grateful that both parties came together to provide relief for American workers and families in this hour of need.  The House of Representatives must now pass this bill hopefully without delay. I think it's got tremendous support. When you're at 96 to nothing and as you know, a couple of those people are quarantined and one Rand Paul is -- he's actually got it, but he'll be better soon. He's been a great guy. He's been a great friend of mine, actually.  The massive $2.2 trillion relief package includes job retention loans for small businesses with loan forgiveness, available for businesses that keep their workers on the payroll. It's pretty good, loan forgiveness, keep the workers on the payroll. It's pretty good. Direct cash payments will be available to American citizens earning less than $99,000 per year, $3,400 for the typical family of four. Expanded unemployment benefits, the average worker who has lost his or her job will receive 100 percent of their salary for up to four full months.  These are things that by the way, we have plenty more to go and but they're things that nobody's ever had any package like this done. And I just want to thank them. Hopefully, it'll get approved equally easily in the House really. I think it will go through pretty well from what I hear virtually everybody. There could be one vote, one vote, one grandstander, maybe. You might have one grandstander. And for that, we'll have to come back and take a little more time and it'll pass. It'll just take a little longer. But let's see whether or not we have a grandstander.  Critical support for the hardest-hit industries with a ban on corporate stock buybacks and tough new safeguards to prevent executive compensation abuse. Over $100 billion for our amazing doctors, nurses, and hospitals. $45 billion for the disaster relief fund, more than doubling the amount available. This is tremendous stuff.  $27 billion dollars for the coronavirus response including a $16 billion to build up the strategic national stockpile with critical supplies including masks, respirators and all sorts of pharmaceuticals. $3.5 billion to expand assistance to childcare providers and child care benefits to health care workers, first responders and others on the frontlines of the crisis.  And these are really brave, incredible people have to say. And some of them are getting sick, and some of them are getting very sick, and some of them don't even recover. They're incredible people. $1 billion for Defense Production Act procurement. We are as you know, using the act, but we use it only when necessary. We use it as leverage. We generally don't have to use it to accomplish what we want to accomplish.  As of today, FEMA has shipped over nine million N-95 masks, 20 million face masks, 3.1 million face shields, nearly 6,000 ventilators, 2.6 million gowns, 14.6 million gloves. And we're sending more every day, and we've got tremendous amounts of equipment coming in. A lot of great companies are making equipment right now.  The ventilators, obviously, they take a little longer to make, but we have a lot of companies making them, and we're going to be in great shape. We took over an empty shelf. We took over a very depleted place in a lot of ways. As you know, the testing is going very, very well. And that was obsolete and broken and we fixed it and it's been going really good.  And I think very importantly, the stockpile, we're really filling it up and we fill it up rapidly, but we get it out. Sometimes we have it sent directly to the states instead. And again, the state has to be doing this kind of a thing also. We're sort of a -- we look -- we look from behind a little bit and we look at how are they doing and if they need help we do it. But it's their first responsibility. Sometimes they just can't get it.  But we load it up and we send it out. But if we can, we have it sent directly to the state. We want it to go directly to the point where we want it. I can now announce something that I think is incredible what they've done in the Navy. Because the incredible Naval Hospital ship, the USNS Comfort, which is incredible, actually, when you see it inside, will be underway to New York City on Saturday.  So it's going to be leaving on Saturday rather than three weeks from now. They did the maintenance quickly and there was going to be there for quite a while longer, another three or four weeks and it should be arriving. I told the Governor 20 minutes ago, Governor Cuomo that the ship will be arriving at New York Harbor on Monday. I think I'm going to go out and I'll kiss it goodbye. I'll go -- I'll go to -- it's in Virginia as you know. And I will go and we'll be waving together because I suspect the media will be following. John, are you going to be following? Maybe. You never know.  It's a great ship. It's a great vessel, right. So if you want to go, I'll see you there, and if you don't, that's OK. After being fully loaded with medical supplies, it's going to be -- it's loaded up to the top and it's over at the Norfolk Naval Base. That's where it departs. It is expected then to -- we're saving about three to four weeks by the incredible work done by the Navy. And I actually look forward to Saturday to see it go.  The ship will arrive and I believe it's going to get a little bit of a ceremony. There's something very beautiful about it. It's incredible piece of work. It's going to be landing at Pier 90 in Manhattan to provide hospital surge capacity for the New York metropolitan area. So it's a surge capacity.  They may use it for this or they may have other people coming in from hospitals, unrelated to the virus, and then they'll use those hospitals on land. They'll use those hospital for a virus. But we'll see how they do it. They could you do it either way. One way or the other, whichever one is best. But it could be because it's set up so well for a regular hospital that they may take people out of hospitals and then use those rooms for the virus.  The National Institute of Health in the private sector, working closely with the FDA, continue to collaborate to discover and test treatments and therapies that can effectively reduce the duration and symptoms of the virus and help -- very much help people to recover. And I'm firmly committed to bringing these treatments to market very quickly.  We have a -- we have a lot of tests going on with regard to different medicines. And I hope -- I hope we get lucky. I hope we hit. A lot of talented scientists and doctors are working on therapeutics, cure, vaccines. I think we're doing very well. Tony may speak to that a little bit later, but I think we're doing very well with regard to the vaccines. I think we're doing well with regard to a lot of the things I just mentioned, but we'll have to see what happens. We're going to know fairly soon about a lot of them. But it's very advanced and the vaccines are very advanced prior to as you know, a fairly reasonably long test period of -- in that case over a year.  Every American should be proud of the incredible spirit our country is brought to this effort. It's been incredible. Citizens from all walks of life have come together to turn the tide in this battle. We're witnessing the extraordinary power of American unity like a lot of people have never seen even getting a vote. You're talking about trillions of dollars and you get a vote of 96 did nothing.  We are waging war and this virus using every financial, scientific, medical, pharmaceutical, and military resource to halt it spread and protect our citizens. I want to express our tremendous thanks to the American people for continuing to practice social distancing, like you people are practicing right here. It's -- I don't know, this room may never be the same. Maintaining good hygiene and follow government guidelines, Vice President Pence lifts up that card every time. And it's not very complicated, but hopefully, you can do that. And your commitment will make all the difference in the world. And that's one of the big ones will be for a while. Stay home. Just relax. Stay home. We're making a lot of progress.  As we continue to gather more information and accelerate the testing, where we're doing record numbers of tests now far more than any other country has done. I told you yesterday, eight days here because you heard so much about South Korea. The media kept talking about South Korea, South Korea. We have a great relationship with President Moon in South Korea. But when I hear so much about South Korea, so in eight days -- in eight days, we do more testing than they did in eight weeks. And it's a very highly sophisticated test.  We'll be able to deploy even more data-driven and targeted approaches to slow the ultimately -- you know, it's a very devastating thing, but we will vanquish this virus and it's -- a lot of progress has been made. That's why earlier today, I said a letter to America's governors describing how we will be using the data to update existing guidance on social distancing which will be developed in close coordination with our nation's public health, officials, and scientists.  Because of the sacrifices of our great doctors, and nurses, and healthcare professionals, the brilliance of our scientists, and researchers, and the goodness and generosity of our people, I know that we will achieve victory and quickly return to the path of exceptional health, safety, and prosperity for all of our citizens.  We have to get back to work. Our people want to work. They want to go back. They have to go back. And we're going to be talking about dates. We're going to be talking with a lot of great professionals. But this is a country that was built on getting it done. And our people want to go back to work. I'm hearing -- I'm hearing it loud and clear from everybody. So we'll see what happens. We're going to have a lot more information early next week and we'll be reporting that back.  But I just want to leave it with you. We have to go back. This is the United States of America. They don't want to sit around and wait, and there'll be practicing. And by the way, a lot of people misinterpret when I say go back. They're going to be practicing as much as you can, social distancing, and washing your hands, and not shaking hands, and all of the things that we talked about so much, but they have to go back to work. Our country has to go back. Our country is based on that. And I think it's going to happen pretty quickly. I think it's going to happen pretty quickly. A lot of progress is made, but we got to go back to work.  We may take sections of our country, we may take large sections of our country that aren't so seriously affected, and we may do it that way. But we've got to start the process pretty soon. So, we'll be talking to you a little bit more about that next week. And with that, if you have any questions, you could ask, and then I'm going to have the vice president stay behind and he's going to take questions and also introduce some of the people. You could ask them some questions. John, please.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President, employment numbers outdated 3.3 million. I take it not a surprise, but still a staggering number. I'm wondering about your perspective on that?  TRUMP: Well, it's nobody's fault. Certainly, not in this country. Nobody's fault. We got very lucky when we made a decision not to allow people in from China at a very early date. I say that because some people don't want to accept it. But this was a great decision made by our country. Well, there's -- the numbers that you're talking about, were big country, they'd be far greater, far, far bigger.  So when I heard the number -- I mean, I heard it could be six million, it could be seven million. It's 3.3 or 3.2, but it's a lot of jobs. But I think we'll come back we're strong. The sooner we get back to work -- you know, every day that we stay out, it gets harder to bring it back very quickly. And our people don't want to stay in.  So I know those numbers, John, but I think you'll see a very fast turnaround once we have a victory over the hidden enemy, as I say. It's a hidden enemy. Sometimes a hidden enemy is a lot tougher than somebody that stares you in the face, right? So we'll see what happens. But I mean, they're fully expected numbers, at least. I mean, at least. Steve, please.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's a U.S. proposal to deploy some troops along the Canadian border. And Prime Minister Trudeau is complaining about that. Why is that necessary?  TRUMP: Well, we have very strong deployments on the southern border, as you know, with Mexico and we had some troops up in Canada, but I'll find out about that. I guess it's equal justice to a certain extent. But in Canada, we have -- we do have troops along the border.  You know, we have a lot of things coming in from Canada. We have trade, some illegal trade that we don't like. We have very strong sanctions on some. We have very strong tariffs on dumping steel. And we don't like steel coming through our border that's been dumped in Canada so they can avoid the tariff.  You know, I charge a lot of tariff for the steel. And it's been great for our steel companies, because now they can really go -- you look at what's happened with steel. It's been pretty incredible. But we've taken in billions and billions of dollars in tariffs on steel. And much of it comes in from China, but they can come through the Canadian border, too. So we're always watching for that.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If I'm reading the numbers correctly, the United States now has surpassed China as the country with the highest number of virus cases. Does this surprise you at all? Is it following a predictable trajectory?  TRUMP: No, I think it's a tribute to our testing. You know, number one, you don't know what the numbers are in China. China tells you the numbers -- and I'm speaking to President Xi tonight, I believe. We'll have a good conversation, I'm sure, but you just don't know. You know, what are the numbers? But I think it's a tribute to the testing. We're testing tremendous numbers of people. And every day the way the system works -- and I want to thank especially Roche has been fantastic, great company. They've done a tremendous amount.  Deborah was telling me before that they were really -- they've really stepped up to the plate and done great, as have other of the companies. But it seems that they're really doing it particularly well. So, you know, we'll see what happens there. But it's a tribute to the amount of testing that we're doing. We're doing tremendous testing. And I'm sure you're not able to tell what China is testing or not testing. I think that's a little hard.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President, on the 3.3 the jobless claims. You just suggested it's six to seven million. A lot of those workers --  TRUMP: I didn't say that. You're wrong. I didn't say that. I said some people are projecting that would be six or seven, and it's, I believe, 3.3.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You came with 3.3. Millions of Americans out of work, some of them will be losing their insurance. What's your plan to make sure -- no fault of your own, as you just mentioned. They stay insured. Are you willing to plus up the subsidies for some of the exchanges under ObamaCare, expand Medicaid, what's being considered?  TRUMP: Well, I mean the things I just read to you are being considered, and other things are being considered. People are going to be getting paychecks, and it's not their fault. What happened to them is not their fault. So we're doing -- we're doing a lot of different things on health insurance. We have meetings on it today. We're taking care of our people. This is not their fault what happened, and we're taking care.  We're starting off by sending them very big checks. I think for a family of four, it's about $3,000. And we're taking care of our people. We're taking care of our workers. This was not -- you know, as I say, this was a financial crisis. This was a health crisis, a medical crisis. We're going to take care of our people. Please, yes.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The National Restaurant Association came out (INAUDIBLE) with a survey this morning saying that three percent of all restaurants in this country have shuttered for good in the past three weeks. And the projection is that 11 percent more are going to close in the next 30 days. So what do you say to a restaurant owner who is looking at his sheets and thinks he has to close within the next 30 days?  TRUMP: Well, I hate to -- I know the business very well. I understand the restaurant business is a very delicate business. It's a business that is not easy. You know, I always say in a restaurant business, you can serve 30 great meals to a person or a family and they love it. One bad meal, number 31, they never come back again. It's a very tough business. But they're great people that run restaurants.  And I've heard three percent could be lost, and you could go as high as 10 or 11 percent. But they'll all come back in one form or another. It might be a different restaurant. But it's going to be a great business for a lot of people. And we're making it easy for people to -- look what we're doing -- what we're doing in terms of loans, what we're doing in terms of salaries, they'll all come back. It may not be the same restaurant, it may not be the same ownership, but they'll all be back. Yes, sir, please.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You mention the pledges from American companies to provide supplies. But is it -- does it -- as we top 81,000 cases in the U.S., does it make sense to read as using the Defense Production Act?  TRUMP: Well, I talk about the Defense Production Act a lot, and I've -- you know, I've enacted it. I have it. I can do it with a pen. And we have actually used it on two minor occasions, and then we could withdraw it. But for the most part, the companies, we don't need it. We say we need this, and they say, don't bother, we're going to do it.  I mean, we were dealing with Ford, General Motors, 3M, we're dealing with great companies. They want to do this. They want to do this. They're doing things that that frankly, they don't need somebody to walk over there with a -- with a hammer and say, do it. They are getting it done. They're making tremendous amounts of equipment, tremendous amounts.  And when this is over, we're going to be fully stockpiled, which they would have never been, except for a circumstance. This was -- this was something that nobody has ever thought could happen to this country. I'm not even blaming. Look, we inherited a broken situation, but I don't totally blame the people that were before me in this administration. Nobody would have ever thought of thing like this could have happened.  But the production act, Defense Production Act is a wonderful thing, but I just haven't had to use it. They know it's activated. They know I can use it. Maybe that frightens them a little bit. You know, it's got tremendous power. But I haven't had to. Please.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you, sir. A question for me, and then another question, if you'll let me, from some of my colleagues who are social distancing.  TRUMP: Where are they? There were all outside trying to get in. I know.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The first question has to do with cruise liners like Carnival and Royal Caribbean. They want this really bad, but they're worried that because they offshored to places like Panama, and Liberia, they might not qualify. (INAUDIBLE) has said that they should move back to the United States. before they get a check. Do you agree? Should they pay U.S. taxes to get U.S. Taxpayer Relief?  TRUMP: So I'm a big fan of Senator Hawley. And I also like the idea. There were some senators that didn't want to do anything like Carnival great company, but they're based in different places. I won't tell you why. I could tell you exactly where they're based, but I won't do that. But they're based in actually more than one places. You know, ships are registered on different locations.  I do like the concept of perhaps coming in and registering here, coming into the United States. It's -- you know, it's very tough to make a loan to a company when they're based in a different country. But with that being said, they have thousands and thousands of people that work there and maybe almost as importantly that work onshore filling the ships with goods and products. And the cruise line business is very important. And I know Carnival, what a great job they do, Micky Arison. And I would think that we could stick with Senator Hawley and maybe really look at that very seriously.  Look, it's a big business. It's a great business. It's a business that employs tremendous number of people outside of the ship itself. I mean, you look -- you look at these ports, it's loaded up with shops and people that are involved with the ship. So we're going to work very hard on the cruise line business, and we're going to try and work something out. But I like the concept. Yes, go ahead.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you, sir. The Senate bill includes aid that's directly tied to the airlines. And since before the pandemic, Boeing was already suffering from, you know, the losses of 737 airplanes. Do you think it's appropriate to use this legislation to sort of provide them with $17 billion of aid on top of, you know, $25 billion that they could qualify for as a passenger airline and another $4 billion that they could qualify for, as a hardware airline? Is that fair?  TRUMP: So the airline business is a very tough business. Over many years, it's been very, very tough. It's got everything. It's got labor, it's got very strong, powerful -- you know, you look at the cost of these airliners. Everything is tough, very highly technological. You look at how complicated, how complex. It's got unions, it's got everything.  The airline business, generally speaking, as you know, it's a very tough business, always been a very tough business. With that being said, we have to keep our airlines going. And we're going to be using some. Now, maybe we'll take a piece of the airlines for the country, for our country where we loan money and we take a piece which are all fully ready. We're ready to go.  But if we didn't do that, we'd end up with no airlines, and we can't do that. The airline business is very vital to our country. It's a tough business. We have to understand that. So not -- I mean, I could tell you other businesses that are different kinds of business. They're very good businesses, but airlines have always been very, very tough. Please.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. President --  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, please. I didn't called you. I called this gentleman.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you. Thanks a lot. On Monday --  TRUMP: Who are you with? Who are you with?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm with Bloomberg.  TRUMP: Has Michael doing good?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President, on Monday, did you speak with Chinese President Xi before you urged Americans to not blame Asian-Americans for the coronavirus? We've noticed that Xi has backed off that language. I know you're speaking with him --  TRUMP: No, I did not. I'm speaking to him tonight. It's scheduled to go tonight. I'll have a call with President Xi of China. We have a very good relationship. No, I didn't like when they came up -- and it wasn't him. Somebody at a lower level, mid-level, we found out pretty much. But they made a statement that our soldiers brought it into China. Now, it came from China.  And, you know, we just signed a very big deal with China. They're paying us a lot of money in tariffs, and other things. They never paid us 10 cents. Look, China has taken advantage of the United States until I came here with sleepy Joe Biden and Obama and Bush and everybody else. I'm not blaming them. I'm blaming everybody. They were allowed to $500 billion a year, they would take it out.  We had trade deficits that were so large, nobody's ever seen anything like it, and we've changed it. Look, now we're taking in billions of dollars, and we gave some to our farmers because China, you know, they targeted our farmers, and our farmers are very happy. And our farmers got through a very rough period because of what I was able to do. I took the money from China and gave it to the farmers. And we had plenty leftover after that.  Now we're going into a phase two negotiation with China. But we're getting 25 percent on $250 billion, and then we're getting a lot on money after that. So we've never had a deal with China. China took advantage of the United States. And you know what, I don't blame China for that. I blame the people that we're right here because they should have never allowed it to happen. But the relationship with China has been a very good one. John?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President, did President Xi asked you to calm that language down or to not use that language?  TRUMP: He never asked me to calm it down, no. Somebody might have spoken to somebody but nobody spoke to me about it. I think it was time though, because, you know, I talked about the Chinese virus and I made it. That's where it came from. You know, if you look at Ebola, if you look at all, the Lyme, right? The Lyme, Connecticut, you look at all these different horrible diseases, they seem to come with the name with a location, and this was the Chinese virus.  But I don't have to say if they feel so strongly about it, we'll see. But you know, we have -- we just made a great deal with China. Great, hopefully for both parties. But we made a deal with China and we're going to do another one, it looks like. They want to do it very badly. Maybe they want to wait like Iran.

MARK CUBAN REPEATEDLY DECLINES 'VIEW' CO-HOST'S PROMPTING TO BASH TRUMP OVER CORONAVIRUS That preposterous filter makes it easier for them to slam the other side. It absolves them of nuance, intelligence and thoughtfulness, all of which are missing here. “He’s a fan of money first, mortality second,” CNN host Chris Cuomo said of President Trump. “The greatest generation. They are going to be sacrificed. For what? … The fear that Trump’s efforts to be president will be hurt?” CNN’s Jim Acosta said, “He's going too fast, causing confusion and quite possibly endangering lives in the process.” CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said, “You have to stay in, and for the president to make light of that as if it's like, well, so what? Some people will die, but the economy will grow.” Do they really believe Trump is putting the economy before human life? No. It's just a game they play to keep busy. The fact is, solutions to problems aren't “either-or,” but ""this and that."" The solution here will be flexible, and ever-changing depending on the risks we identify. So it may be that we return to work in phases. Perhaps the young and healthy first; perhaps depending on region; perhaps depending on the type of business. There are lots of factors and reasons for guarded optimism. It's why Dr. Anthony Fauci and Trump work well together.

36,FOX,"Amid the coronavirus crisis, the media believe you either shut down the economy indefinitely or you want people to die. This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" March 25, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: We're going to get jobless claims (ph) the first probably a real short economic reflection that this has had an impact, up to four 4 million Americans who could announce they're applying for jobless benefits. Here is The Five.  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino, along with Greg Gutfeld, Jesse Watters, Juan Williams, and Katie Pavlich. It is 5:00 in New York City, and this is The Five. Breaking news out of Washington, at any moment, there will be a White House Coronavirus task force briefing. Those have been very hopeful to getting all of us information.  And we will take you there live as soon as it happens. But meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, Mitchell McConnell and Chuck Schumer say there is a deal in place to vote on a $2 trillion economic stimulus package. But it looks like there are still issues to iron out. Some Republican lawmakers are warning the bill has a serious error that will encourage employers to actually lay people off.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We cannot encourage people to make more money in unemployment than they do in employment.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: On unemployment, you would be making $24.07 an hour in South Carolina. There are a lot of jobs in South Carolina that did not pay $24.07. This bill pays you more not to work then if you were working.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: So those senators say they are working on an amendment to fix that issue. And Bernie Sanders, remember him? He's tweeting this. Unless Republican senators drop their objections to the Coronavirus legislation, I am prepared to put a hold on this bill until stronger conditions are imposed on the $500 billion corporate welfare fund.  Now, after negotiations got delayed over Democrat's so-called wish list, some of their demands have still made it into the bill, including $25 million for the Kennedy Center, Democrats also insisting on a provision that would prevent President Trump's businesses from receiving any government assistance money.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Democrats did secure a provision to block Trump's family businesses from receiving loan money under the program. And that is something that I've been discussing and I'm very concerned about that.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have written a very strong provision, not just for Trump, but certainly for him. But for any powerful official, a cabinet, senator, or Congressman, if they own a business or their family owns a business, they should not get these loans. The people in office should not write legislation that benefits them.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: All right. Katie, I wanted to go to your first because there is lot here, right? First of all, let's just put President Trump aside. But if there is a company that is actually connected somehow to members of Congress, are those workers that work for them any less important than other people across the country? This bill is big. It is fast. And it's actually going to be pretty controversial.  KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS HOST: Yeah, Dana. To answer your question, this narrative that President Trump was somehow pushing this aid bill because he wanted to personally benefit from it as if there are not hundreds of workers who work at Trump properties all across the country who are also suffering. Now, the president agreed to not have any of this bill touch any of his properties.  But if we are going to go through every single member of Congress who may have some kind of business tie to a corporation, there are going to be a lot of people who don't qualify for this who are working for companies that are tied to those lawmakers. Now, to the question of this massive error that's written in the bill, the Senate bill, the Senate version that Lindsey Graham and Ben Sasse senators warned about today.  This is what happens when we have a $2 trillion, 1400-page piece of legislation that is written in haste, understandably, because we are in an emergency. But there will be unintended consequences of what is being pushed forward here. And maybe some thing's that aren't being completely thought through, and again, understandably, because we are trying to get this pushed forward so people can get some help.  But then again, you go back to the timeline of when this all started on Sunday. This could have been done on the Senate side. And Nancy Pelosi has now wasted about four days grappling over trying to get this far left wish list into the bill. A lot of it was taken out. The stuff about elections was taken out, thankfully.  The greenhouse gas emissions with the airlines was taken out and other things. But now, we are on day five tomorrow. And she still hasn't decided when they're going to take it out for a vote in the House. And now, we're seeing these hold-ups in the Senate. So this was a done deal earlier in the week. They've caught some errors.  And yes, there will be unintended consequences for things that have not been completely thought through in terms of the numbers here.  PERINO: Juan, this will be the biggest bill of this type. I'm just wondering if you have a historical perspective about -- members Congress, you know, finally coming together, but, you know, being frustrated with each other on the backend because it's not going to be perfect.  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: No. And I think you're making a really important point that there are going to be critics out there -- I mean, gosh, how many critics, you know, there were critics about TARP back in 08, 09, where people said why are we bailing out, you know, Wall Street? Why not Main Street? And then on the other side, there are people who said we did not do enough to save some of the larger corporations that could've sped up the speed of the recovery.  Remember, a lot of people saying, gee, this recovery is taking a very long time. And then you had people on the left saying, well, if we put more money in, if we had done that sufficient spending, it could have been faster. And I think that is why -- to pick up on Katie's point. It really does not matter to me if this bill is signed today or tomorrow.  What matters is that we get it as right as we possibly can. Now, I have a different perspective. Katie is saying, hey, you know what? You don't want to -- and remember these senators. You don't want to discourage people from working. And I think that is absolutely on target. It's just that to my mind, there is a bigger issue, which is American families.  I just want to make sure that given what is going on, that the American family of the working class, and I say that I mean middle-class, working- class, poor people, that they are able to survive. When you think about it, the $1200 payment to families, these people are going to be facing rent on April 1st. And you've got to pay for utilities. And you have got all sorts of things to pay for.  I don't know that that is enough to really sustain people, especially if we're going it over several months. I just want to make sure that, you know, given the $500 billion is going to these huge corporations, that there is accountability, transparency. I want that. But I want families protected.  PERINO: I think that that's -- a lot of that's in the bill. Greg, I do want to get your take on that, because Bernie Sanders saying that he's going to hold this up because corporations might actually get some benefit here in order to keep people employed. Like, who does he think is paying these people in the first place?  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: In order for people to keep that thought on their head, they have to pretend that corporations are run by some kind of inanimate object. Corporations are made up of people. The peoples have families. Families consist of children. People need the money so they can continue to living, and of course, pay their rent. I disagree.  You don't have to get this bill to be perfect. We don't have the luxury of perfection right now. We have to get something through that will help people. And, you know, when you see people in disasters who take advantage of those earthquakes or floods, they are called looters. And if fiends who are sneaking stuff into this relief package are trying to slow it down, they are looters too.  Because they are hurting a relief package that is there for millions and millions of people. And government is not helping by wasting our time. I mean, what do these people do for a living? We have -- for the past two weeks we have sacrificed our freedoms so we can beat this virus. And they can't even stop acting like politicians with a metaphorical gun to their heads, i.e., a virus in an emergency situation. They can't even change their goddamn behavior. It is absolutely disgusting.  PERINO: And Jesse, I got to say. If I were the Kennedy Center at this point, I would say we don't want the money, because it is going to become the symbol of that bridge to nowhere we were talking about last night. It is still in the bill.  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: There is money in here for congressional salaries, Dana. There is money in here for NPR, millions. There is money in here for illegal aliens, open border, Green New Deal, all sorts of social justice regulations, it's crazy. On the other hand, you have a $500 trillion boatload of dough going to god knows who in corporate America with no strings attached.  Here's a string. If we're going to give you $500 trillion, maybe build some plants in America instead of China. Is that so hard? I'm a TV guy. I mean, these are professional politicians. And they are coming out at the last second like they have nothing to do with the legislation. It's like a restaurant owner complaining what is on the menu. Dude, you can change the menu.  What is Bernie Sanders doing? It is 3:30. Can you wait until the market closes, Bernie? Like, where have you been all weekend? You could have changed this with Chuck and with Mitchell McConnell. These things are really bad. And to Juan's point, $1200 is the median rent payment in America. So half of the country is going to take all the Trump bucks, pay the rent, and have nothing left.  So it has to be more focused on hospitals and small business and average American families. Because if you give $500 trillion to big corporations, you're going to just see corporate raiders go on buying sprees to start snapping up all these little small and midsize companies. It's going to change everything. But to Greg's final point, these people aren't very smart.  It's going to be an ugly mess, but it is our ugly mess. It's all we have got, and it's going to juice the market big time. And if it hurts --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: Trump is going to pay a big price.  GUTFELD: Dana --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Excuse me, sorry. I just want to apologize for swearing in the -- a few minutes ago. I lost my cool.  WATTERS: I didn't even hear it.  PERINO: You know what --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: I took your name in vain, Jesse.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: -- commercial break. All right, we have a lot going on. Everyone is very stressed, but we are going to keep going here. We are still awaiting that White House task force meeting. That's going to happen pretty soon. We will take it to you. But up next, Greg, on what some of the media are saying about President Trump wanting to reopen the economy.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: The media's favorite way to report a story is from their prism of two ideas, where they are lifers. And that two ideas sell you are either pro-immigration or a xenophobic bigot. You either love this planet or embrace evil big oil. You're either for peace or you want war. Their latest, you either shut down the economy indefinitely, or you want people to die.  That preposterous filter makes it easy for them to slam the other side. It absolves them of nuance, intelligence, and thoughtfulness, which are completely missing here.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He is a fan of money first, mortality second. The greatest generation, they're going to be sacrificed, for what? Fear that Trump's efforts to be president will be hurt?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He is going too fast, causing confusion, and quite possibly, endangering lives in the process.  NANCY PELOSI, HOUSE SPEAKER: Stay in, and for the president to make light of that as if it's like, so what, some people will die, but the economy will grow, no.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The president who is eager to try to get the economy back on track, because he sees it as what (ph) to his chances of being re- elected.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The president is putting human life at risk. It is literally immoral.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Literally. Who is she? Now, do they really believe Trump is putting the economy before human life? No, it is just a game these idiots play to keep busy. Fact is, solutions to problems aren't either/or, but this and that. The solution here will be flexible and ever-changing, depending on the risks as we identify them.  So it may be that we return to work in phases, young and healthy first, perhaps depending on region and type of business. There are lots of factors and also reasons for guarded optimism. It is why Fauci and Trump work well together. Fauci is the cautious. Trump is the generator of hope, understanding that people create deadlines even if those deadlines change.  The press forgets that when it's bad cop-good cop, both cops want the same outcome. What would the media prefer Trump to say? It doesn't matter at all since they are often wrong. But a smart person can stand back and see the whole field. The media just stares at one patch of the ground and screams at the ants. You know, Dana, I think that, like, Trump understands that people need a measure of certainty.  And the certainty comes in a date, even though the date is going to change. The idea that you can see light at the end of the tunnel is a way that you could be optimistic and get through the next week or two weeks. People -- smart people understand this.  PERINO: Yeah, so permission to make an analogy?  GUTFELD: What?  PERINO: OK, so I have -- permission granted?  GUTFELD: Oh, I didn't hear you.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Sean had doing his hands in my ear. Sorry.  PERINO: Sean. OK, so my analogy is this, if you have ever worked out with a trainer --  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: Let's say they tell you you're going to do 15 squats, three sets of 15, and you finish that. And then they say all right, one more set of 15, right?  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: You -- but you know what? You do it because it is good for you.  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: And you get through it. And so I sort of think about this, like, can I make it to Easter? Can I make it to Easter? Yes, I can make it to Easter. Now, if at that point they say, you know what? We got to do one more week.  GUTFELD: Yeah.  PERINO: OK. I can do one more week. It is good for me. And I think that -- to your point, this will be done thoughtfully. There is nothing rash going on, except for maybe throwing $25 million to the Kennedy Center.  GUTFELD: Yes. Juan, is it fair to say that, like, the president take -- would choose an economy over the death of its citizens?  WILLIAMS: Well, I hope not. I mean, I just don't think that what we should be saying about President Trump or anybody. I mean, we have got to understand it. But to my mind, you know, this is what I was trying to say yesterday. I think there is a disconnect even if you try to look at the president as an optimistic cheerleader for all of us.  There is a disconnect between what he is saying and what we are hearing from the scientists and from the doctors, including Dr. Fauci, with regard to one week of realistically expect to lift this. Because if we rush this, Greg, and say let's get back to work by Easter, then we could incur a second wave of this kind of Coronavirus outbreak and get that, you know, the famous curb could, you know, spike again.  And we don't want that, because that is not good for the economy. And it's certainly not good for people who are at high risk. You know, grandma and granddad, even me.  GUTFELD: Yes.  WILLIAMS: So we want to keep me alive.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: I want to --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: -- just the president. Thank you. Thank you. But I just think that, you know, to say -- to blame the president, I think it's to say, Mr. President, please pay attention. There is nobody in our society that we should be writing off. But we -- even if you are just thinking about the economy, keep in mind what the doctors and scientists are saying.  We need to be able to rely on you as a trustworthy source. And right now, people are not so much interested in the kind of cheerleading, as they want to know exactly what we are up against. But what we are being required to do that will help.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: But Jesse, it seems that the public do trust President Trump on this. And the optimism is valuable when it is paired to, say, the sober analysis of the expert, Fauci. That is why they are together, the good cop- bad cop.  WATTERS: I know Juan hates polls, but the polls say the public trusts Trump over the media. Don't mean to rub it in. That's just a fact, Juan. Someone just sent me a great line. Are you guys ready for this?  GUTFELD: Yes.  WATTERS: If you tell people that if you have to stay inside for seven days straight in order to save the 2020 football season, the entire south would be locked in their room right now. Do it for football. Do it for football, all right? So that is how you have got it across the people. And I agree with Greg. It is a false dichotomy.  You're not saying let's open up business in order to pay Wall Street bonuses. That's not what you are doing. You are not trying to say let's kill grandma so Wall Street fat cats could get rich. That's now what they're saying. They're saying we're going to look at the science, the data, and the models, not the models that Juan likes, the models with the graphs.  And that's going to determine if Easter is the right date or if we have to extend another week like Dana's trainer mixer. That doesn't mean you are killing people so we get a higher GDP. That just means you are working smart. You're working safely, because a lot of Americans, outside of New York, feel like I'll take my chance with the Coronavirus.  But I'm not going to take my chance with a great depression, you know? And a lot of people that get Coronavirus don't die. That is not saying it's not a threat. That's not saying it's not a risk. But people see risks in other measures. And that is what you are trying to balance.  GUTFELD: Katie, last word. What do you think?  PAVLICH: Right.  WILLIAMS: Hey, Greg, before you go --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Wait. Let me just get Katie in, Juan.  WILLIAMS: Oh, go right ahead, Katie.  PAVLICH: -- prediction on the media narrative here. So when he does start opening up the economy incrementally, he's not just going to open up everything right away. They're going to complain about the border to Mexico not being opened up fast enough, for example. They're going to that the Chinese should be able to fly back and forth and that the Europeans should also be able to fly back and forth if he doesn't open up those things fast enough.  But the stimulus bill that they were trying to get done in D.C., right now as we speak, will buy them time so that the medical experts have more time to convince the public and to ask them, as they have been doing, to follow the guidelines so we can get out of this thing. And then President Trump will be able to make some economic moves.  There are places in the country that will not -- you know -- there will be longer implications for this, like New York, like California, but the idea that Democrats don't like this and the media don't like it either, because President Trump is speaking to the workers that they are supposed to be in charge of that they are supposed to be in control of politically.  President Trump has always spoken to the workers. He's always had a populist message. And that is the same today, and that's why they are having a visceral reaction to this, and that's exactly who he is talking to.  GUTFELD: All right.  WILLIAMS: Well, can I say I hope that he is looking out for workers and their families. But I just wanted to make a quick point about --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: -- and even about the Green New Deal that you guys keep harping on. You know, there are a lot of people going back to the 08, where you saw people say we got to save America's arts and cultures because there are millions of jobs related to arts and culture, like sports. And there are millions of jobs in renewable energy.  WATTERS: Juan, there's a lot more jobs in restaurants, in hospitality, than at the Kennedy Center.  WILLIAMS: I -- there are jobs there, too. But I'm saying --  WATTERS: But $25 million for the Kennedy Center?  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: All right. You know what? I see Juan's point. But I -- for one, I'm not going to miss performance art, OK? If that doesn't come back, I will live. All right, the White House Coronavirus task force briefing set to start at any moment, next up on The Five. You want me to read this? DOJ' warning that people who try spreading the virus on purpose could face terrorism charges.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WATTERS: White House Coronavirus task force getting ready to hold a briefing soon. And we will take you there once it starts. But now, more dumb behavior from young people during this pandemic. Kentucky's governor is ripping 20-somethings who actually went to a Coronavirus party. One person ended up testing positive afterwards.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have a positive case today from someone who attended a Coronavirus party. Anyone who goes to something like this may think that they are indestructible. But it is someone else's loved one that they are going to hurt. And don't be so callous as to intentionally go to something and expose yourself to something that can kill other people. We ought to be much better than that.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: And the Justice Department is warning people who try to spread the virus on purpose could be facing terrorism charges. And there are already some examples. A Missouri man was charged after he licked items at his local Walmart to mock virus fears. And a New Jersey a man who coughed on a grocery store employee is set to face terroristic threat charges. Gutfeld, go into the mind of these sick puppies and tell us why would anybody cough at a grocery store or anything like that now.  GUTFELD: If you get into their mind, there's a lot of space to relax, believe me. You know, in every crisis, there are people who do good, people who do bad and just plain jackasses, and the majority of Americans have to do the right thing in order to make up for the idiots.  But I still maintain that these idiots are still not as bad as our politicians, or misinformed media, or the bureaucrats whose red tape are killing people. Here's just a terrible thing. If you have symptoms of the coronavirus and you go to your doctor, he's not going to give you any drugs until you take the test because you have to take the test first and then you got to wait five days in which you can get sicker, you could spread the virus, or you can die.  Instead, if we just pushed all the red tape out of the way and let the doctors doctor, the moment you go in and you got that dry cough, they can give you that drug because right now, those doctors are giving that drug to their patients off-label, and they've got it for their families, and we don't know how to get it because we have to take the test and we have to wait five days. So the bureaucracy, the politicians, the red tape, 10 times worse than these idiots that do this for the TikTok.  WATTERS: Just lock them all up then right, Gutfeld?  GUTFELD: Yes, that too.  WATTERS: That's right. So now Katie, they're threatening to slap people with terrorism charges if they do some of these wacky stunts in public. Maybe it just takes one charge on one person and make everybody else freeze.  PAVLICH: Yes. I mean, there are usually consequences for things like this. And it seems like law enforcement is trying to let those people know that there will be consequences for their actions. I think that dictionary.com added the word covidiots in reference to those who are going to Coronavirus parties and I think that's right next to Darwinism in the dictionary.  These people are examples of how not to behave during a crisis like this. They clearly just want attention. There are a number of other things you can do, especially in the digital age, to get attention that do not involve putting other people in harm's way, making people feel scared. And so you know, these people will suffer consequences whether it's getting coronavirus or whether it's going to jail for a couple of days, even though they're letting prisoners out so their chances of doing that are pretty low.  WATTERS: That's right. Juan, like I said, to save football seasons, stay inside, right?  WILLIAMS: Anything, Jesse, anything. We'll do anything we can. I'm already feeling like my NBA season is not coming back.  WATTERS: That's true.  WILLIAMS: But I will say, I think that this is beyond stupid, it's beyond idiotic or what did Katie say, covidiot or the new word that they got there.  WATTERS: Don't be a covidiot.  PAVLICH: Covidiot.  WILLIAMS: Covidiot -- there we go. I think this is criminal. I think this is criminal. This -- what this reminds me of is the kind of laws they put in to punish people who had like intentionally spread AIDS. That if you go about this without, you know, in terms of interacting with people without telling them, I have AIDS and you do this, even if it wasn't intentional about, you know, spreading it, it's a criminal act.  And for people to spit on food, lick food, or caught in someone's face because they're angry at them in the checkout aisle, to me, that's beyond stupidity. You are complicit in a criminal act and you should be punished.  WATTERS: Bioterrorism, maybe. That's what we could charge them with. All right, Dana, these kids, I guess, that went to this coronavirus party, this is after all over the news we talked about the spring break scandal. So not only did they not listen to that, now they're going a week later to coronavirus parties. These people are -- they need to get their head checked.  PERINO: Well, you know, there was -- it's interesting. There was a neurologist that wrote in The Wall Street Journal today, an opinion piece in which he said he thinks that younger first responders in their 20s and early 30s, that we should intentionally expose them to coronavirus so that they could maybe build up a herd mentality -- or what's it called?  WATTERS: Immunity?  PERINO: Herd immunity. Herd mentality is also something else that happens. And I asked a firefighter about that today and he said, I'm assuming that this guy isn't worried about his wife and children and other people. And, you know, I understand that when you're young, you do think that you're indestructible or you think that you know, my grandma said that maybe if I get this, then I'll never get it again.  Let's just all try to do the right thing for each other, staying inside. It's not the hardest hardship that people have ever had to go through. Although I didn't notice in the commercial break, I've watched -- I've walked 419 steps today. That's it.  GUTFELD: Wow.  PERINO: And I am going to have to -- I'm going to have to do something. I'm going to have to walk up and down the stairs. The peloton is not enough.  WATTERS: Oh, wow, all right. Well, go take Jasper for a walk and we'll see you tomorrow. We're still waiting for the Whitehouse Coronavirus Task Force press briefing. But up next, New York City is at the epicenter of this outbreak here in America, but there are some positive signs that couldn't be good for the rest of the country.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WILLIAMS: Welcome back to THE FIVE. The White House Coronavirus Task Force's press briefing is going to begin at any moment. That's coming up very soon. Meanwhile, New York City, it's the epicenter of Coronavirus outbreak here in the United States. In response, the White House is issuing a warning for people to self-quarantine for 14 days, if they recently traveled to the Big Apple. Here's New York's Governor Andrew Cuomo on the growing COVID-19 crisis.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): We still have the trajectory going up. We have not turned the trajectory nor have we hit the apex. Remember what that line is going to do. It's going to go up. It's going to reach a high point. It's going to tip. It's going to go back down. We're still on the way up the mountain.  The current projection is that could be in 21 days. So ramp up the hospital capacity to make -- to be able to handle that apex volume.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: There is something -- there are some positives coming out of New York that could be good for the rest of the country too. The governor saying hospitalization rates for people infected are now slowing. And clinical trials for possible COVID-19 treatments are beginning in New York State.  Jesse, I wanted to come to you and say that I saw some numbers that indicate like 90-plus percent of Americans say they are doing social distancing. And the reason I wanted to bring this to your attention is I didn't believe it, Jesse. I think people say they're doing it but it's pretty hard to do social distancing. So I thought I'd ask you. Do you think it's true that most -- 90 percent of us really successfully keeping our distance from each other?  WATTERS: Could people be lying to pollsters, Juan? Is that what you're asking me? Perhaps. You know, they're lying about a lot.  WILLIAMS: I don't know. Maybe they're lying to themselves.  WATTERS: Yes. Maybe your social distancing --  WILLIAMS: Yes. They could be lying to themselves.  WATTERS: Maybe your social distancing is a little different than mine. But if that's a number that's true, then that's a great number, but we still have to work on the other 10 percent. We're getting a lot of attention, obviously at in New York because it's the hotspot right now. It's also the epicenter of the media and the financial capital.  So, you see New York getting a lot of attention, and then you also see Seattle, and San Francisco, and Los Angeles, getting a lot of attention. The rest of the country I think, was a little slow on the uptake to get the whole social distancing deal, but they are getting it and I think that's a positive.  I just heard that My Pillow is manufacturing about a million masks. SpaceX is manufacturing hand sanitizer. G.M. and Ford are starting to get in the game. So, you know, ships are on the way to New York, They're on the way to the harbor outside of Los Angeles.  And you're seeing people hiring in places like Amazon, 7-Eleven, Dollar General. And those are some bright spots that people need to kind of focus on. Don't always focus on the negative. Focus on the bright spots. That's going to help us pull out of this thing.  WILLIAMS: That's pretty good advice. And Katie, what about this quarantine for people who've been in New York recently? I think you've been in New York recently. I know I have. Do you think people -- and here's what I noticed is a lot of wealthy people, wealthy people who are going out to like Long Island or going up to Connecticut, they're being told you must self-quarantine. Do you think that message is getting through?  PAVLICH: Well, I have been so quarantining and self-distancing. So even though you're calling me out right now, I can tell you, I've been doing the right thing, Juan, except for a little bit of walking outside with my dog, of course. And it's easy to do social distancing when you have a dog.  But I want to focus on the data here. The testing issue has come a long -- a long way. And that's really important because the more testing we have, the more data we have, and usually in politics as you know, if you're explaining you're losing, but in this case, the White House Task Force has been able to explain every day and communicate what this means.  And the more data we have on the number of people who have it, who aren't going to the hospital, who are not being put in intensive care, will make people feel better, and have a better understanding about what is going on and what their risk level is. And then in turn, will enable the president to make some decisions about how to move forward with opening up some of these economic opportunities as we go down the road to that date of April 12th.  But in terms of New York, sorry, New Yorkers. If you traveled around the country, I guess you've got to self-quarantine for 14 days. Don't go to a coronavirus party.  WILLIAMS: Oh, my gosh. Greg -- hey, Greg, what do you think about the reports that we're getting, some progress with regard to vaccines and ways that we can develop antibodies? I think realistically, it's about a year away, but this is good news, wouldn't you say?  GUTFELD: Yes, absolutely. In fact, when we factor in all these grim scenarios, we don't factor in human ingenuity and the fact that there are drug treatments available. Now I know that a lot of people say oh, wait, but it's not this -- hydroxychloroquine is not, plus the antibiotics, plus I believe zinc. That's not you know, legal, but actually, your doctors can prescribe off label and they will.  If you ask them and you have symptoms, any good doctor -- I won't say who. But anyway, the problem -- the problem with saying that the whole city is going to be like somehow cordoned off is like to Katie's point, we don't have the data. We don't have the common denominator, that denominator of infection rate. So we don't really know what the fatality rate is yet.  We don't -- we probably -- it could be that everybody gets it, and 99.99 percent is fine. But we don't know that because we have to test everybody. Dr. Siegel says that if we could do a serology -- is that serology test? But you just test everybody, then you know what the denominator is, and then you can see how -- you know, how super dangerous or semi-dangerous or not dangerous at all this virus can be. But we don't have that yet.  And that is why we must treat it with the worst-case scenario, because you don't want to -- it's better to overreact and be wrong than to under-react and be dead. Did I make sense?  WILLIAMS: Well, that's interesting. So, Dana, I think what you're hearing from the doctors is that they have to do a lot of tests on any potential vaccine because of potential side effects. You don't want people to get hurt and lose trust in the, you know, in the idea that the scientists are trying to cure them.  PERINO: But I think that we should -- we should support our scientists from all around the world and the ones here in America that are putting things like -- we are able to use things like artificial intelligence. We were able to communicate so quickly. Think about back in -- when they had the Spanish Flu in 1919, they couldn't actually, you know, talk to each other on a zoom conference call. Like, we are going to be able to do this more quickly than in the past and that's amazing.  The other thing is, to the governor's point, when he said that we are starting to flatten the curve, right? Well, we should be proud of ourselves because of social distancing for doing the things that we're -- that they asked us to do, we are flattening the curve, so that the hospitals are going to be able to hopefully have an easier time dealing with it.  Now, there's a problem coming and that is the number of ICU beds. We've seen this. We know that it's coming and they're trying to fix it. But because we are doing what the government asked us to do, and the public health officials, to put ourselves in our homes, to only walk 419 steps in almost, you know, 24 hours, those things are, are doing what they were intended to do. So that's why we should keep doing it even though it's frustrating. We can do this because it's working. You see the results.  PAVLICH: Yes, do it for this season, as Jesse said.  WILLIAMS: Katie, you're up.  PAVLICH: All right, thanks, Juan. Well, we're still awaiting a Coronavirus Task Force briefing. While we wait for that, let's get to some lighter stories. It's now time for the ""FASTEST SEVEN."" First up, Joe Biden has been attacking President Trump saying that he needs to stop talking and start listening to the medical experts. Apparently, Biden hasn't been listening to those experts either. Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I have not talked to any individual. Excuse me.  JAKE TAPPER, HOST, CNN: You know, you're supposed to cough into your elbow. I don't know, sir. I learned that actually covering your White House --  BIDEN: You know, actually, that's true. But fortunately, I'm alone in my home, but that's OK.  TAPPER: All right.  BIDEN: I agree. You're right.  TAPPER: You should just -- it's kind of old school to do it with your hand than do it with your elbow like you're supposed to do it.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PAVLICH: So, Jesse, so Biden answers this question and is told this after he's asked if he's been tested for coronavirus and he says, I don't have any of the symptoms, and then he coughs right into his hand.  WATTERS: His excuse was the best. And I've made so many excuses in my life. I know when someone is just firing off a lie. And so yes, like, if there hadn't been someone else in the house, Biden is lying, would have been, oh, then I would have coughed here. Come on, Joe. You got caught and you got caught by CNN. That's even worse.  PAVLICH: Juan, based on the rules that we've all been told, don't you think that he should follow them even inside of his home on national television?  WILLIAMS: Yes, he could model it. But I think this is like we're just picking on him. I guess we're having fun with him. But I mean, it's, you know, the thing is about if you're doing something like that in public, if you're moving around, I don't think that if you're in your basement, just by yourself, I just -- I mean, to me, this is like, OK. But I understand the point, which is, he's a model. He's likely nominee. And yes, so be a model.  WATTERS: Yes. Don't be a covidiot, Biden.  PAVLICH: Covidiot. Dana, your thoughts on Biden coughing into his hand and not his elbow.  PERINO: Well, I think that Biden did finally something today that I thought was smart. He told Bernie Sanders like enough of this. Because Bernie Sanders said today, if there's a debate in April, I'm going to be there. And Biden was like, I've had enough. Like, we're not doing that, so I thought that was good.  But I also think that Joe Biden, he can't compete with the president right now. He should have tried to compete with the President. We are in the middle of a national crisis. I truly believe that if Joe Biden spent the next three weeks not on television and working behind the scenes to build up an organization that he is going to need if he's actually going to try to run against President Trump. I think that he should just take a back seat for now.  PAVLICH: Yes. Greg, can Biden really run for president from his house?  GUTFELD: I don't know. He just doesn't seem like a leader to me. I don't think he ever was a leader. He's just a go along to be along. Him being the nominee is scarier than his cough. And by the way, do you honestly believe he was actually alone? He's sitting there, there's no aides in that room. There's no -- there's nobody setting up the camera. There's -- like, he just happens to do this all by himself.  So he just lied straight to Jake's face who by the way, Jake should have his own hygiene hour because I just liked how strict and disappointed he was. He should have an hour where he grades people's behavior because that look on his face just made me wither.  PAVLICH: I think it's great. All right, next up, not some great news. Prince Charles sending shockwaves through Britain after testing positive for coronavirus. The heir to the British throne is now self-isolating after displaying mild symptoms but otherwise remains in good health according to a spokesman.  You know, Dana, the Queen has gone into isolation in light of this pandemic. Prince Charles now tested positive besides he feels good. A scary thing for the world and for the royal family.  PAVLICH: Well, the leader of Morocco also has tested positive and apparently, he and Prince Charles were all at dinner together. So you could just imagine if you know how this virus is transmitted, then there's probably a lot more people there that had it. I do -- I did wonder if Meghan Markel and Harry were rethinking their decision to leave the U.K. They might want to go back.  PAVLICH: Well, now they're -- I think in Canada. I'm not sure if they can make that decision. Jesse, your thoughts?  WATTERS: You expect me to say something mean about the royal family and I won't do it.  PAVLICH: No, I don't. No, I did not. That's not true.  WATTERS: I feel sorry -- I feel sorry for the man. He's in an advanced stage of his life and I hope he gets betters.  PAVLICH: Of course.  WATTERS: That's what I'm -- this is a positive hour for me.  GUTFELD: Hey, well, I won't -- I won't follow Jesse. I don't care if somebody famous gets this one bit. They aren't any more valuable than your family or friends.  WATTERS: You do care.  GUTFELD: No, and let's be honest.  WATTERS: You do. You were talking about Tom Hanks in the green room for a week.  GUTFELD: You're lying. Jesse, let's be honest. I don't think -- I don't think Prince Charles is going to be worried about getting medication. He's a prince. In fact, he'll get his pills as every celebrity or anybody who's famous will get their pills before our viewers. And that should piss off our viewers that there is a class system here that people can cut in front of the line.  Look at the NBA. Look at all the athletes. Look at the people suddenly finding out that they have the coronavirus. How are they able to find out and nobody else was? It's because the rich and famous do have different rules than the rest of the people. Your relatives, unless you know somebody famous, are screwed. So that's my opinion on the prince.  PAVLICH: All right, Juan, you want to follow up on that, on the prince. Do you have any opinion following on Greg's opinion?  WILLIAMS: Well, you know, I think -- well, first of all, I think he's like 71 and Camilla, his wife is like 72 so they're in the danger zone. That's the red zone for coronavirus. I will say, I think that, you know, given the rate of testing there as opposed to here, it looks like they're doing a little better.  But you're right, Greg. I think if you have money and connections, you're more likely to get the test. And you know, that's aggravating to people. And hopefully, now we see that the U.S. is catching up on the testing, according to Dr. Birx, and so I'm optimistic that we're going to get even on that front.  But it's still, even if you're talking about medical treatment, who gets treated first and who's going to get attention first, it's always going to be people with means and connections.  PAVLICH: Yes. You know, Dana, on that issue, it's been really interesting to watch the private sector, donate money, whether it's individuals or companies getting behind some kind of --  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: So nice to be with you. America continues to gain ground in the war against the virus. I want to thank the American people for answering the call, following our guidelines, and making the sacrifices required to overcome this terrible threat more aggressively. We commit to social distancing. It's so important. Social distancing, such an important phrase, and we do it right now.  The more lives we can save and the sooner we can eventually get people back to work, back to school, and back to normal, and there are large sections of country probably can go back much sooner than other sections, and we're obviously looking at that also. People are asking, is that an alternative? I say, absolutely, it is an alternative.  I have now approved major disaster declarations for New York, California, Washington, Iowa, Louisiana, Texas, and Florida. That has great significance, as you know, and legal significance. We're in a constant grouping and like I can say this, we have a large grouping of people that does nothing but communicate with the various officials, including -- we've been spending a lot of time with New York officials because that really is by far the hottest spot.  They've got a number of very tough weeks ahead of them. The governor is doing a very good job. I spoke to the governor, Governor Cuomo last night and this morning, and he mentioned that -- in his remarks that he's using the -- that we are using, and I think he feels because he understands negotiation, he thinks we're using very appropriately the Defense Production Act. And we are we're using it where needed. It's a great point of leverage. It's a great negotiating tool.  But I've really -- I will tell you, there's tremendous spirit from people and tremendous spirit with respect to these companies. And I don't have to use it very much at all. They want to do it. As you know, General Motors is involved, Ford is involved, 3M is involved, others are involved, and they're all working very hard to produce product, different -- all different products.  We had very little product when we came. We built it up and we've we give it away as fast as we can to the different states. We're also as you know, building numerous hospitals and medical centers throughout certain areas in New York. It's at the convention center, the Javits Convention Center. We're doing four hospitals and we're doing throughout the state for medical centers. They're somewhat different.  I want you to know that I'm doing everything in my power to help the city pull through this challenge. I'm working very hard in New York. It's really, by far, our biggest problem. Maybe it will be, maybe won't be. But there's a lot of good capable people working on it with us. And our teams are working very well with the state representatives.  We're also doing some very large testing throughout the country. I told you yesterday that in South Korea, this is not a knock in any way because I just spoke with President Moon, we had a very good conversation about numerous other things, but they've done a very good job in testing. But we now are doing more testing than anybody by far. We do more in eight days than they do in eight weeks and we go up on a daily basis exponentially, so it's really good.  By the way, while I'm on it, I also spoke with Prime Minister Abe 0f Japan last night and I congratulated him on a wise choice. I think it's going to be a fantastic Olympics 2021. I think it's going to be a fantastic Olympics. It was the absolute right decision to delay it for a full year and now have a full beautiful Olympics. It's going to be very important because it's probably the first time maybe ever or certainly in a long time that it was on an odd year. So we don't even year, they tell me, but he's going to have a fantastic success.  And now that I've even more time, he didn't need any more time. Everything was perfectly ready. What a job they've done. But Japan, I want to congratulate Japan, the IOC, and Prime Minister Abe on a great decision. I think it's going to be a fantastic Olympics. I told him, I'll be there. I'll be there.  As we fight to protect American lives, we're also protecting American livelihoods. Democrats and Republicans in the Senate are very close to passing an emergency relief bill for American workers, families and businesses, this legislation in addition to the two bills I signed this month that includes as you know, sick leave and we have all sorts of things in for the workers, for families.  But we have a tremendous paid sick leave provision for workers at no cost at all to the employers. And it's a big thing, no cost to the employers. We want to get everybody back working. Together, this $2.2 trillion legislative package is bigger than anything I believe ever passed in Congress.  Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

You probably don't need any more evidence that the media is a joke. But I’ve got some anyway. Apparently a man died after eating a chemical used to clean fish tanks. It made the news. Why? REP. MIKE GALLAGHER: POLITICIANS, FIGHT CORONAVIRUS IN THESE TWO WAYS — STOP FUNDRAISING AND DONATE CAMPAIGN FUNDS TO CHARITY He did it to prevent coronavirus. But also, it could be blamed on President Trump. Buzzfeed, the Hill, NBC News and even Forbes claimed he took a drug that Trump touted. An NBCNews.com headline says, “Arizona man dies after ingesting chloroquine in an attempt to prevent coronavirus.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Not really. He took something else -- chloroquine phosphate -- which is deadly. It's like mistaking sodium chloride, which is salt -- and sodium hydroxide -- that's lye. (The stuff that eats flesh.) It’s so close... Here's a quote from the Forbes piece: When President Trump incorrectly announced that the FDA had fast-tracked approval of the drugs chloroquine and hydroxy-chloroquine for treatment of COVID-19, he added, “the nice part is, it’s been around for a long time, so we know that if things don’t go as planned, it’s not going to kill anybody.” Except it just did. Well, no it didn't. Like the guy who ate the fish tank cleaner, the writer replaced the promising drug with something worse. And why? Because it fits the narrative. Trump finally kills someone! And he didn't even shoot him on Fifth Avenue! This isn’t just normal Trump Derangement. Its derangement that might cause people to avoid treatment out of fear. Look, all drugs carry risks. And the companies put them on the label. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Maybe it’s time for the media to have a warning label, too: ""Warning: can be mistaken for truth.

38,FOX,"Trump says Americans want to return to work; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" March 24, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: We'll keep you posted on that. Also keep you posted on others who are reacting to the president's goal of at least maybe the start on winding a lot of this extra (ph) time, a little too soon. But we're going to be debating that. For now, here comes ""THE FIVE.""  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino, along with Jesse Watters, Juan Williams, Greg Gutfeld, and Katie Pavlich. It is 5:00 in New York City, and this is THE FIVE. President Trump telling the country that we have to go back to work. And he is hoping to have the economy back open by Easter, which is just about two and a half weeks from now.  We are also awaiting a White House Coronavirus Task Force briefing. It comes as worldwide cases of COVID-19 top 400,000. More than 50,000 of those cases are here in the United States where over 600 people have died. The World Health Organization is warning that America could become the epicenter of the outbreak.  President Trump saying he is weighing these factors, while trying to find a balance between public safety and protecting the economy and jobs. Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: Our country's not supposed to be, you know -- it's not built to shut down. Our people are full of vim and vigor and energy. They don't want to be locked into a house or an apartment or some space. It's not for our country. We're not built that way. You can destroy a country this way by closing it down, where it literally goes from being the most prosperous.  And we had the best economy in the history of our country three weeks ago. And then all of a sudden, we're supposed to shut it down. And then we're supposed to pay people not to go to work. We never had that. But we can socially distance ourselves and go to work. And you have to work a little bit harder. And you can clean your hands five times more than you used to.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: And White House Coronavirus response coordinator, Dr. Deborah Birx, saying that testing in America is ramping up.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DR. DEBORAH BIRX, WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE COORDINATOR: In the last eight days, we've done more testing than South Korea. But we did that because we transformed the testing process as the president spoke to. But we don't want people who are just worried to go get tested. They're about 50, 60, 70,000 tests a day now.  They could get potentially to 150,000 a day, but we want to make sure we're testing in the areas that really have the problems.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: Jesse, on the testing front, like, we knew that the testing would increase, and we knew then that the number positives would increase. And so you are seeing those numbers. And they are pretty stark, but she was saying that part of that is in the plan.  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: So right now, America is playing defense. And in about two to three weeks, we're going to start going on offense. We are now crouching down, but that's kind of pausing everything to ramp up production to fight this thing and eventually kill it. We've mobilized the Army Corps of Engineers, FEMA, the National Guard.  We're going into hot zones and building up hospitals. We're unleashing the private sector in a way that hadn't been done before. And now, we are really starting to get serious with the test. About 300,000 tests conducted in about a week, and 90 percent of the people that get tested are clean. And then of the 10 percent that are not, the mortality rate is now dropping below one percent, it looks like.  So those are really good numbers, also good numbers looks like -- they are coming out of Italy, indications are that this thing may have peaked there. We are not sure yet, but that's what the indication is. And also, in a couple of weeks, you're going to get the self swab test, which you can purchase and use at home, or you're going to have the finger prick test, which is going to give you immediate results.  So that's a good thing. Andrew Cuomo also agrees with the president that we are going to have to soon start pivoting to getting back to work. That doesn't mean everything opens up all at once. Things are going to be different in Seattle and San Francisco and New York, but we're going to work smartly and we're going to roll it through.  People are going to be washing their hands. We're going to be cleaning all surfaces. We're going to be fist-pumping and all of that stuff. Greg's not going to sit on everybody's lap anymore. You just have to work smartly. And it's also like --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: I've been waiting for this day.  WATTERS: Finally, finally. And it's like 9/11. Remember, Dana, the thing to say was if you see something, say something, everyone. When they see their grandparent doing something silly or they see their college student doing something ridiculous, they have to say, hey, and they say something. Knock that off. That's not the right way to do it.  And we are all learning from this. We can't overwhelm the hospitals if we have a little sniffle. Things are going to get back to normal, not in a matter of months. We hope it's just in a matter of weeks.  PERINO: Greg, talk to us about your thoughts on the desire for Americans to get back to work. The concern if you do it too early, you risk a health relapse. You do it too late. You could possibly have even more damage. And so it's -- if we had more data, more information we could maybe pinpoint a little bit more.  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Yeah. First, if you see something, wash it.  So OK, what you're talking about is -- when I talk about the prison of two ideas. It's a war between two straw men, right? No one wants to destroy the economy, and no one wants to let the virus ravage the population. The media, however, loves to create that illusion that there are only two choices because then they can pit Fauci against Trump, and they have a lot of clicks from that.  But you cannot be forbidden to ask the important questions. It doesn't make you heartless to ask when people should go back to work, because if you have 330 million people at home doing nothing, there are risks that go up for other things, including suicide which a lot of experts have been talking about, or if your business is ruined.  Psychologically, that's devastating. So the economy and the epidemic don't have to be Sophie's choice. I hope I'm using that correctly. It's not war or peace. There's an infinite number of phases in between shut down and 100 percent open for business. And smart people understand this flexibility, which will factor in your age, your health status, family status, type of business, for example.  Maybe some businesses can open and others things can't. I have an analogy, two kind of weird analogies. Number one, the economy is like a transformer, right? Right now, we folded it up, and now depending on risk, you're going to start unfolding it again. It's not all going to come at once. It reminds me of my mom's dining room table.  You know, she could extend it when people were coming over, then she'd shorten it when it was just us. Our economy is incredibly flexible. And it's going to return in phases. So stop thinking about either or, it doesn't exist.  WATTERS: What do they call that thing that you slide into the table? Was it the leaf or something?  GUTFELD: A leaf. We have economic leaves everywhere.  WATTERS: Right.  PERINO: Great analogy. Juan, I wanted to ask you about this part and play it for you. President Trump addressed this question about whether there is tension between him and Dr. Fauci. He said this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is everything cool with you and Dr. Fauci? He wasn't there last night for the briefing. He's not here today.  TRUMP: Because he has other things to do. No, we get along very well.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Your relationship is good?  TRUMP: I think it's been very good. You would have heard about it if it wasn't. I respect all of these people. These are great people. And Deborah is extraordinary, and Tony is extraordinary. I get along with all of them.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: It is always tempting to try to see what's going on from a personality standpoint. But I think there is a risk of the media constantly asking if there is a rift between Dr. Fauci and President Trump. They're probably going to disagree on some things. But for the most part, it does not look like they are getting along?  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, I think the big item here, Dana, is that there seems to be a disconnect between what the president is doing in terms of pushing in the direction so quickly of getting the country's economy back up and what the officials, you know, the doctors, the scientists like Dr. Fauci have been saying.  Because I think that their -- from the scientific medical community's point of view, how does it help the economy if we have a large number of people continuing to get sick? It's not a matter of hyperbole. I mean, there really are facts, data that indicates that right now 40 percent of the people in the hospital are between 22 and 54.  So it's not just saying, you know, oh, we can just push grandma, granddad to the side and move on. There are lots of working people, productive people in the middle of their careers who would be hospitalized. So I think there's lots of questions. Dr. Oz today on the Fox special with the president asked just that question.  You know, how can you make a decision now about what's going to be in reality two and a half weeks from now? And the president said we will keep an eye on things. But at this moment, I think you have lots of people like Dr. Fauci who are a little bit unsure about this rush to get the economy and get things reopened.  PERINO: Yeah. I mean, -- and of course, Katie, it's just going -- we need more information. We have to be flexible. We have to have a goal. And I think that letting people know that there is going to be end in sight. I think that probably helps a little bit. Just want to point out, the Gallup poll today showed President Trump at a 60 percent approval for his handling of the virus, Katie.  KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, and, Dana, as you know presidents have to speak to a number of different audiences on a variety of topics, especially on something as important as this. And he's been speaking to everybody who was scared about what the virus could do to them, to their families, to their livelihoods. That is something they've been addressing for weeks on end now.  Ad now he is pivoting to discuss and to target and to specifically address the concerns from people who are saying, OK, we've all gone along with the 15 day period where we are all supposed to follow these guidelines. We are willing to do that. The private industry has stepped up and done all of those things, but we didn't need to hear about what's going to go forward with the economy, and whether we are going to be able to get back to work.  And as Dr. Birx said yesterday, if you give people a deadline, they are actually more willing to work towards really hunkering down and making sure that what they have to do in that time period works. And so having a deadline is a good thing. The president can talk to both groups the same time and have empathy for what people are going through, whether it's being scared about being hospitalized or being scared about losing their entire livelihood due to the economy.  PERINO: And all of us can be flexible as well and listen and do the right thing in the meantime. All right, members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force will be holding a press conference. That'll be in just a little bit. And we will take you to that when it happens. Up next, Congress nearing a Coronavirus stimulus deal, finally. And the Democrats are now changing course after being called out.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WATTERS: Welcome back. Live look at the White House where the Coronavirus Task Force is set to hold a briefing moments from now, and we will take you there once it starts. In the meantime, lawmakers say they're a lot closer to a deal in a $2 trillion aid package after Democrats blocked the bill two days in a row. Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi are now optimistic about working with Republicans, but only after being exposed.  President Trump calling out the Democrats from pushing elements of the Green New Deal in the negotiations.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: We almost had a deal the day before. And it was between Schumer and Mitch, and it was really a good solid deal. All of a sudden, they start throwing all of the little Green New Deal stuff in, right? And the boardrooms, what they look like, and we want green energy. We want all the stuff. Let's stop drilling oil. They had things in there that were terrible.  Windows all over the place, and all sorts of credits for windmills, they killed the birds and ruined the real estate, right? A lot of problems, I mean a lot of problems. And I said I'm not turning this deal.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: And even though Nancy Pelosi's own bill is filled with wind and solar tax credits, $35 million for the Kennedy Center and corporate board diversity standards, the Speaker claims that's not the case.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  NANCY PELOSI, HOUSE SPEAKER: That's not a bill I would have written in terms of some things that relate to family medical leave, that relate to worker protections that -- ruling on worker protections, but we -- that can be done next administratively. We can find other ways. Not enough money for elections, etcetera, at this time.  All of -- everything we are suggesting just relates to COVID-19. It's not about making law for the future.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Katie, takes a lot of you know what to try to shoehorn some of the stuff in there. I mean, did they think that no one was going to find out? What do you think the strategy was, Katie?  PAVLICH: Oh, sorry, Jesse. There was a break in your microphone. I think the strategy was that Nancy Pelosi saw an opportunity to walk all over Chuck Schumer in the Senate, and say we are going to push a lot of these unrelated pork projects into the bill because no one is going to question us on it because it's an emergency.  Well, it's a good thing Republicans were paying attention, because $35 million to the Kennedy Center is an affront to taxpayers everywhere. Americans are losing their jobs. And they want to take hard-earned money from them and give it to the Kennedy Center when they could be doing private fundraisers to make up the difference if they're losing money.  The other issue here that is alarming is the pushing throughout of the federalizing of our elections with the ballot harvesting, the long-term effects of the early voting they wanted to push through on this. I mean, Nancy Pelosi has seen an opportunity here, and Chuck Schumer who said Sunday that everything was going along just fine.  Let her walk in. Walk all over him and blew up the whole system on behalf of Democrats seeking power rather than working on something that will help everybody regardless of whether they are a Republican or a Democrat.  GUTFELD: Yeah. Juan, Dana made that point the other day. Everything was going swimmingly until Nancy showed up and made Chuck kind of cater to her every whim at the last second and rocked the markets. Do you think Chuck saw that coming or was he taken by surprise?  WILLIAMS: I think this whole description that we are going through right now is a caricature. I think what's going on is Democrats are out about protecting America's workers. And I think the sticking point has been that there was money being set aside for corporations, to make sure the big corporations, to make sure they didn't go under. But that the Democrats wanted transparency and accountability for that money.  They didn't want those big corporations to simply get locked into buybacks and executive pay raises. They want to make sure those companies are protecting and keeping workers during this time period. And I think that is what we saw now from the Democrats.  WATTERS: But what does that have to do with the Green New Deal, Juan?  WILLIAMS: Listen, a lot -- it does. That's why I say. I think what -- the way we presented it this evening is a caricature of what's really going on.  WATTERS: Oh, I didn't notice that.  WILLIAMS: We have -- I think so. I think the president is quick to say he can put Democrats at a disadvantage by making it seem as if they are involved in some kind of power grab or self-promotion of some wild agenda. But you go back and you look at TARP, you know, the Troubled Asset Relief Program from 2008, and you will see similar protections are in there.  And again, so many Americans felt the big business is too big to fail. They've got the money. But the average person -- and Jesse, you and I agreed on this yesterday. You have got to put more money into the average person's pocket so they can go out and spend --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: -- I thought it was something else.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Absolutely. Look at the reality, Jesse.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: -- for unemployment relief.  WATTERS: I do.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: I got you. Greg, what are your thoughts on this whole relief package?  GUTFELD: I'll tell you what. I think that the only way you can fight a virus is through diversity. So I'm really happy that that's a priority. Look, we are all making sacrifices. I said this before. But what's depressing is you know the very same people are up to the very same tricks even when times are urgent and ugly, like I get it with the normal stuff.  When you're doing a normal budget, sneak all the stuff in that you can't so get re-elected, but that's not this time. And what's doubly depressing is that we really, honestly don't know who's doing it. I mean, we could say, you know, Nancy flew in and said stop it. But she probably did not write this stuff, right? She didn't do it.  Chuck didn't do it. They would have just been happy to sign the damn thing and go back and have a glass of wine. So no one knows who is ever screwing this crap up. It's not all Democrats and it's not all Republicans. Who are the people that are making this so complicated and where is the media? That's a great story. Rather than screwing up every other story about the virus, why don't you try to find out who the people are who are mucking this up. And then, we can fire those creeps.  WATTERS: That's probably the lobbyists, but what do I know. Dana, it would be like if Republicans try to jimmy in, like, de-funding Planned Parenthood into the relief package. Like, if that happened, the media would go wild. Go wild.  PERINO: Believe me. The media would find that one. That would not be a problem. That would not be hard for them to find. The $35 million for the Kennedy Center is the new bridge to nowhere. Remember that way back when?  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: How can this happen? Why are we doing this? Does it make any sense? I'm all for the arts, but this is not the time or the place. And if Nancy Pelosi thinks that this wasn't something that she wanted in there, then she has got to police her troops a little bit better because they look really bad. I think the Democrats came -- once again, you know, you think about the Schumer shut down.  WATTERS: Yeah?  PERINO: Every time they want to fight against the president, they end up with egg on their face.  WATTERS: Maybe -- you know she is fighting for the workers, Dana, just the workers at the Kennedy Center. That's who she cares about.  PAVLICH: Nancy Pelosi could write a check to the Kennedy Center if she has enough money to do it.  WATTERS: And the post office. Don't forget about the post office. All right, the Coronavirus Task Force set to hold a press briefing coming up very soon. Next on THE FIVE, though, Greg tackles misleading media reports on the virus pandemic. It's a good one.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: You probably don't need any more evidence that the media is a joke, but I got some anyway. Apparently, a man died after eating a chemical used to clean fish tanks. It made the news, why? Well, he did it to prevent Coronavirus, but also it could be blamed on Trump. BuzzFeed, the Hill, NBC, even Forbes claimed he took a drug that Trump had touted.  And NBC headline says Arizona man dies after absorbing Chloroquine in an attempt to prevent Coronavirus, not really. He took something else, Chloroquine phosphate, which is deadly. It's like mistaking sodium chloride, which is salt, and sodium hydroxide. That's live (ph) the stuff that eats your flesh. It's so close. Here's a quote from the Forbes piece.  When President Trump incorrectly announced that the FDA has fast-tracked approval of the drugs Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19, he added, the nice part is it's been around for a long time, so we know that if things don't go as planned it's not going to kill anybody, except it did, adds the writer.  Well, no it didn't. Like the guy who ate the fish tank cleaner, the writer replaced the promising drug with something worse. And why, because it fits the narrative, Trump kills someone finally, and he didn't even shoot him on Fifth Avenue. This isn't just normal Trump derangement. It's derangement that might cause people to avoid treatment out of fear.  Look, all drugs carry risks, and the companies put them on the label. Maybe it's time for the media to have a warning label, too. Warning, can be mistaken for truth, only take with a grain of salt. Oh, what a clever ending, if I do say myself, Dana, a clever ending.  PERINO: I was wondering, Greg. Do you miss sitting with us at the table or are you quite happy there by yourself?  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: -- and I'm talking to myself --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: Let me just tell the audience and you. He's going crazy down here. Every commercial break, he's screaming at the top of his lungs. It's weird stuff. Like, it's crazy -- he's crazier than normal.  GUTFELD: Yes. I am.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: Are you taking notes for your book, Jesse?  WATTERS: Yeah. Some of this stuff is too hot to handle.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: I think that this -- well, I go back to this whole thing of -- Americans cannot expect the government to do everything for them. The government is not going to save you. And this idea that President Trump killed the guy because he mentions one chemical that turns out to not be the same chemical that -- again, anybody that's ingesting any sort of chemicals, you should do that if a doctor advises you to. I don't care if the president tells you to do something -- only take chemicals into your body if it is recommended by your doctor.  GUTFELD: Or a good friend like me. What do you think, Jesse?  PERINO: As I was saying, I realized that Greg is going to totally disagree with it.  GUTFELD: No, no, no. I agree with it.  WATTERS: It's always about drugs with Gutfeld. This is what this would be like. If Nancy Pelosi told the country, we need a Green New Deal, and the next day some guy, in order to reduce his carbon footprint hung himself. And Fox News came out with the headline, Nancy Pelosi is climate hysteria drives man to suicide.  GUTFELD: Right.  WATTERS: Hopefully, we've never written a headline like that, but that's what that would be like. It's like headline porn. And do you remember the example of the headline that said, ICE agents arrests immigrant couples on the way the hospital to deliver the baby. And at the way end, at the last paragraph, it turns out the guy driving the car was an illegal immigrant wanted in El Salvador for a double homicide.  That's what they do. They're cheap shot artists. Do you ever play basketball? Some guy can't shoot, can't rebound, can't defend, all he does is foul you, he hacks you, he trips you, he's terrible.  PERINO: I hate that.  GUTFELD: Yes. That's why I got out of the NBA.  WATTERS: That's the media. They can't play. They just take cheap shots.  GUTFELD: You know, Juan, I can understand screwing up on chemical labels because they do sound a lot alike. What drives me nuts is that they copied the same mistakes. It's like I think like, one guy at one place sees it, and just copies it, and doesn't actually read and go like maybe I should fact-check this. That drives me more crazy than the actual honest mistake is that the copying.  PERINO: Right.  GUTFELD: I don't know.  WILLIAMS: Well, no, I think that was a terrible mistake by the media, obviously, and I think you called them out on it. I think that, you know, to my mind, the real tragedy here, though, is that somebody lost their life.  GUTFELD: Right.  WILLIAMS: And it was a fatal error in terms of this person. So what the wife has said is that they heard about this drug and they heard it on television, and then she's looking at the fish cleaner and sees that it has that similar name in it, and that's why she in the husband and just did the drug. And obviously, it killed the man.  That's pretty shocking. I mean, but again, to my mind, it's you know, from my perspective, it's the tragedy here is the death. And I think that people, you know, picking up on what you guys have said, I think people should not be listening to T.V. to get medical advice, and they should -- even from the President. I think the prescription should come from a doctor or at least someone who's in the medical community, not just someone in passing saying, oh, yes, this struggle cure you. We don't know.  As Dr. Fauci said about this drug, we have some anecdotal stories about this, but we don't know for sure because we've never tested it. And so we shouldn't be like, you know, test animals for somebody saying, yes, well, this might work.  WATTERS: Well, Juan --  WILLIAMS: We're all looking for a miracle cure right now.  GUTFELD: It actually might work.  WILLIAMS: So I think we're pretty much, you know, vulnerable.  WATTERS: Governor Cuomo just ordered like 10,000 doses of it, so there is promise in this drug.  GUTFELD: All right, let me get to Katie. What do you make of this?  WILLIAMS: No, I didn't say there wasn't, Jesse. I agree.  PAVLICH: Yes.  GUTFELD: Katie?  PAVLICH: You know, Greg, this is an opportunity for the media to do something good. The first thing is, to your point, you can do some research and you should be shouting from the rooftops about how these two things are not the same. The media could be writing fact checks about how you should only be taking prescriptions from your doctor, like the task force at the White House has been they've been saying, like doctor, Dr. Fauci has been saying, and by the way, New York Governor Democrat Andrew Cuomo has been saying.  And also, they should be highlighting stories of the real drug that has been used in America for people who have COVID-19 coronavirus that has helped them in their own testimonials. But instead, they're so focused on fear-mongering over this and getting at the president for some reason. I'm not really sure what their goal is.  Do they want people to think that there's never going to be a treatment that we've seen work in other cases for American citizens or what is the point of doing this?  WATTERS: The goal is to dunk on Trump. That's it.  GUTFELD: All right.  PAVLICH: Well, that's pretty pathetic.  GUTFELD: We are still awaiting the White House Coronavirus Task Force briefing, but coming up, desperate Joe Biden trying to get back in the spotlight by attacking President Trump. We'll show you what he said on The View today.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WILLIAMS: Welcome back. You're looking live at the White House where the Coronavirus Task Force is set to hold a briefing at any moment. We're going to take you there once it starts. Meantime, Joe Biden increasing his media appearances in an apparent bid to take the spotlight back from President Trump during this Coronavirus outbreak.  The former Vice President went on The View today, and he had some critical comments about President Trump.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Number one thing I'm most concerned about would be is misinformation. Listen to the scientist. Listen to the doctors. Listen to what they have to say. The president not make false -- I shouldn't say false -- not make assertions not based on hard science. And I don't agree with the notion that somehow it's OK to let the let people die, and I'm not sure that would happen. I heard earlier comments in your show and because -- to make sure the economy's there for our kids.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: So, Katie, when you hear the former Vice President speaking out, is it all about getting attention for himself or do you think he has a legitimate role as what -- you know, now he's the presumptive Democratic nominee.  PAVLICH: This is -- this is all about Joe Biden trying to make himself relevant at a time when he is completely irrelevant. I saw this headline on Wall Street Journal that says Trump-Biden dueling coronavirus press briefings. There is no duel here. The President is the one who is taking all of the oxygen up as he should at this point.  He has scientists every single day at the White House briefing the country and the media in that room to talk about what they're doing, how they're going to move forward. There's new information every single day. There's almost so much information, you can't cover it all. And Joe Biden is coming to the table with things that have already been done. And he's not answering any kind of questions and he's doing it by himself.  He doesn't have a Dr. Birx or a Dr. Fauci to back up some of the things that he's been saying, or this group of experts that he's been working with at the White House to reassure the country, that we're going to get through this.  And when you're Joe Biden, and you're only criticizing during a crisis, and you look at the president whose poll numbers have gone up as a result of this, you're certainly losing the argument and only criticizing rather than giving some praise such as Andrew Cuomo has done as the governor of New York and talked about how they can work together on this, I think doesn't do him any good services, and it certainly isn't going to help him politically.  WILLIAMS: Well, Jesse, when you see Joe Biden, he's not saying that he's all about the criticism. He's saying, there have been some lapses, and we all know about the testing and all the rest. Isn't it legitimate to point these things out if you are, in fact, going to run against this guy for president? We haven't stopped the election.  WATTERS: It's legitimate. I don't know if you want to do it on The View. Maybe go on a Sunday show or primetime cable but he doesn't want to do that. I have advice for Joe Biden, he won't listen, but here's the advice. You can criticize, but you could also help out a little, Mr. Biden.  You've been in government, what, 40 years. You can't call a buddy in industry and hey, make some masks. You can't call your other buddy, Barack Obama, maybe put out a video to raise money. How about call on all your supporters or your staff, send him to go donate blood. There's 1,000 creative things that this guy could do to help America through this crisis instead of sit back and criticize on The View.  The other thing I think tactically he's doing wrong with the criticism is he's saying, I'm going to be president and when I'm president, I'm just going to do what I'm told. I'm going to do whatever the scientists tell me, whatever the generals tell me, I'll do what they want. No, you're supposed to listen to the advisors and then as the commander in chief or the president, take decisive action and execute it with vision.  That's what he should be doing. He shouldn't just be saying, hey, when I'm there, I'm going to be a puppet. I'm just going to listen to all the experts, and then after the first term, I'm going to leave. That doesn't inspire confidence or project any sort of leadership. And I know it's hard to project leadership because you don't hold office and you're quarantined in your own library, but he has to do a little bit more than what he's doing.  WILLIAMS: Well, it's interesting, Dana. I didn't think that he was lacking there. I think that he's not the president, and the President has used, as Jesse was saying, the bully pulpit to have a daily T.V. show basically and to promote the idea that he has experts behind him even as he has differences with those experts.  PERINO: Well, I think here he comes now, Juan. Here's the President now.  WILLIAMS: Oh, we have a break now.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I want to thank the American people for the incredible sacrifices that they're making on behalf of our nation. And I want to encourage everyone to keep following our guidelines on social distancing, avoiding large gatherings and hand washing and all of the other things that everybody knows they're supposed to be doing.  Ultimately, the goal is to ease the guidelines and open things up to very large sections of our country as we near the end of our historic battle with the invisible enemy. You go on for a while, but we win, we win. I said earlier today that I hope we can do this by Easter.  I think that would be a great thing for our country, and we're all working very hard to make that a reality. We'll be meeting with a lot of people to see if it can be done. Easter is a very special day for many reasons, for me, for a lot of -- a lot of our friends, that's a very special day. And what a great timeline this would be. Easter as our timeline, what a great timeline that would be.  My first priority is always the health and safety of the American people. I want everyone to understand that we are continuing to evaluate the data. We're working with the task force and making decisions based on what is best for the interest of our fantastic country. In order to defeat the virus, we must continue to be very strong. Your resilience and spirit has been inspiring to everyone.  Right now, this virus is attacking 149 countries, but everybody looks to us and they're watching us, and I'm very proud to be a president. I can tell you that. There's tremendous hope as we look forward and we begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Stay focused and stay strong and my administration and myself will deliver for you as we have in the past.  Let me provide you an update on critical preparations and supplies in a war on the virus. Through FEMA, the federal government is distributing more than eight million N-95 respirators, 14 million surgical masks and many, many millions more under order and there'll be arriving soon. 2.4 million face shields, 1.9 million surgical gowns, 13.5 million gloves, and more than 4,000 ventilators to the areas of greatest need have already been sent, and we have 4,000 being delivered to New York.  The federal government is using every resource at its disposal to acquire and distribute critical medical supplies. The core element of this strategy is my executive order authorizing the use of the Defense Production Act which has, as you know, already been activated actually a long time ago, quite a long time ago.  Private companies are heating our call to produce metal equipment and supplies, because they know that we will not hesitate to invoke the DPA in order to get them to do what they have to do. It's called leverage. You don't have to you use it from the standpoint of actually, it's been activated but you don't have to use it. But the threat of it being there is great leverage and companies are doing as we ask, and companies are actually even better than that. They're coming through and they're calling us.  And it's been really something to see this morning. Ford, 3M, General Electric Healthcare are many making tremendous numbers. They've already started respirators, ventilators, and face shields. They're working together. We didn't have to exercise or utilize the DPA in any way. The fact that we have it helps, but we didn't have to, and for the most part, we won't have to.  We're receiving full cooperation from companies with the understanding that the federal government stands ready to compel cooperation if need be. We haven't found that to be the case. It's been really amazing to see these big, strong, powerful, and some cases, very small companies, family-owned companies, step up and make a lot of great products for our going through and what we will continue to be going through for a while.  The Army Corps of Engineers and the National Guard are building four hospital facilities in New York City at the Javits Center, which will be operational very soon. They've already started. In addition, they're building four separate medical facilities in different parts of the state. We're dealing with Governor Cuomo on that. So you're going to have four hospitals and four medical facilities at the highest level to really incredible facilities. Temporary but incredible.  We're also deploying the U.S. Navy hospital ship and that will be arriving in New York Harbor in the not too distant future. It's finishing its maintenance. They're doing a very big maintenance, and what we did is we condensed it very seriously. And as you know, the other hospital ship, and these are incredible ships, it's already on its way to Los Angeles.  So we're in frequent contact with state and local officials and getting a lot of work done. We're likewise building hospitals in Los Angeles. We're working also in the state of Washington. We're working with the governor of the state of New Jersey, building a medical facility, a hospital facility, and doing a lot of work.  I want to thank the people from FEMA, the great people from FEMA, and also the Army Corps of Engineers. Secretary Mnuchin and the members of my administration continue to work closely with Congress. I'm pleased to report that we are working to pass the biggest and boldest financial relief package in American history.  Senators will soon hopefully vote on a $2 trillion bill that will deliver direct cash payments to struggling Americans. No fault of their own. This came out of nowhere. Nobody can imagine this even happened. But it's not their fault. We want to protect and we will all have the things that a person needs protected and a family needs protected.  We're working on job retention loans for small businesses, and extended unemployment insurance for laid-off workers. The legislation will also include billions of dollars for additional resources for our -- and really heroic, these are incredible doctors, nurses, brave -- and hospitals as well as support for hard-hit industries such as the airline industry and the cruise ship industry which employs tremendous amounts of people.  And obviously, these are very important functions beyond that, with very tough protections for the American taxpayer, the loans will be very secure and they will be very profitable. And at the same time, they'll bridge -- they call them bridge loans in many cases. There'll be bridging these companies back into very good health. Some of them are very important companies that four weeks ago didn't have a problem.  I'm also confident that the Democrats will do the right thing. I feel very confident. They're working very hard together right now, Republicans and Democrats, and they're getting very close to a very fair deal and a great deal for the people of our country.  Today, as you probably saw, the Dow surged over 2,100 points. That's the all-time record history of the exchange. This is very encouraging. And I think part of the reason is they are looking at what is close to being passed and I think a very big part of it is they see that we want to get our country open as soon as possible. They see we're working very hard on that. That's a very big factor, I think, in today's historic gain.  The legislation developed in the Senate is the first step to restoring confidence and stability to America's economy as we look ahead to the time when we can carefully and responsibly reopen our country for business. And we hope that's going to be very soon.  I want to assure Americans that we have a team of public health experts. You've gotten to know them as well as I know them. They're great people, incredible, talented, and they love our country. Also, economists and other professionals working to develop a sophisticated plan to reopen the economy as soon as the time is right. One based on the best science, the best modeling, and the best medical research there is anywhere on Earth.  Our great people have been especially when it comes to our public health experts and officials have been helping other countries dealing with other countries, constant touch with other countries, helping them out because many of them have never seen anything like what's happening. But our decision will be based on hard facts and data as to the opening.  I'm also hopeful to have Americans working again by that Easter, that beautiful Easter day. But rest assured, every decision we make is grounded solely in the health, safety, and well-being of our citizens. This is a medical crisis, this isn't a financial crisis. But it's a thing that nobody has seen for many, many decades, nothing like this.  Marshaling our economic strength is a key feature of defeating the virus, producing the material supplies and equipment that we need and they're doing a really fantastic job. We're helping the governors. We had a conference call the other day with a governor and we allowed the press to join us on the call and the spirit between us and the governors has been really great.  We should never be reliant on a foreign country for the means of our own survival. I think we've learned a lot. We've learned a lot. This crisis has underscored just how critical it is to have strong borders and a robust manufacturing sector. For three years, we've embarked on a great national project to secure our immigration system and bring back our manufacturing jobs. We brought back many jobs, records numbers of -- record numbers of jobs.  And this really shows, this experience shows how important borders are. Without Borders, you don't have a nation. Our goal for the future must be to have American medicine for American patients, American supplies for American hospital, and American equipment for our great American heroes.  Now both parties must unite to ensure the United States is truly an independent nation in every sense of the word. Energy independence, we've established that and something incredible that we've established. Where energy independent. Manufacturing independence, economic independence, and territorial independence enforced by strong sovereign borders.  America will never be a supplicant nation. We will be a proud, prosperous, independent and self-reliant nation. We will embrace commerce with all but we will be dependent on none. Above all, we know that the best thing for our economy and the world right now is a very, very powerful victory over the virus.  Every day, the American People are showing the unity and resolve that has always defined the character of our nation. In New York, citizens are using 3D printers to make hundreds of face shields. They're making them by the hundreds. In Texas, businesses and churches are uniting to collect gloves and thermometers for hospitals.  In the selfless actions of our amazing citizens, we're seeing enduring strength of our magnificent nation, a spirit that can never be broken, and a victorious future that can never be denied. It never will be denied. Now, what I'd like to do is, perhaps ask a person who has really established herself as maybe the world's greatest expert on what she does.  If I could ask Deborah to come forward and say a few words, and then I'll ask Tony to come up and speak and then our Vice President, and then we'll take a few questions and we'll do it quickly. And we'll probably see you again tomorrow. So Deborah, please.  DEBORAH BIRX, CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE COORDINATOR, WHITE HOUSE: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. I think those of you who heard the town hall, we are continuing to accelerate testing at a record rate. We now have 370,000 tests that have been done. The majority of those over 220,000 in the last eight days, which those of you have been tracking the South Korea numbers put us equivalent to what they did in eight weeks that we did in eight days.  This was made possible because of the HHS team working together, bringing together the strength of the FDA, with the CDC, and under the leadership of Secretary Azar. We're very proud of those numbers, but we know that we have to do more and we continue to accelerate in testing to ensure that those who need the test are tested first, and have access.  As we talked about yesterday, we're working on the ability for people to take their own sample. That does not mean home testing, that means taking your own sample in the front of your nose with available swabs into normal sailing that can be transported to the laboratories. That will allow and free up all of the drive-throughs to be very sparing on PPE because you'll be able to do that with gloves rather than the full PPE outfits. This will allow for more that PPE to be dedicated to our hospitals.  I think those of you who are tracking this epidemic closely like I am, you will begin to see that there is encouraging results coming out of Italy. We are impressed by the decreases that are seen and mortality, the number of people succumbing to this illness, and the number of new cases.  Our new cases will continue to surge because we're still working on our backlog. Although we will be in touch with the laboratories after this press conference to really find out how many are still in backlog and how many were run in the last 24 hours. Until we can get into a 24-hour cycle, we're going to have disproportional number of new cases compared to the actual new cases. And we will let you know when we've reached that equilibrium.  Finally, and I know Dr. Fauci will talk about this further, we remain deeply concerned about New York City in the New York metro area. About 56 percent of all the cases in the United States are coming out of that metro area, and 60 percent of all the new cases are coming out of the Metro New York area, and 31 percent of the people succumbing to this disease.  It means, because they still are at the 31 percent mortality compared to the other regions of the country, that we can have a huge impact if we unite together. This means as in all places, they have to be following the presidential guidelines that were put out eight or nine days ago, and this will be critical.  But to everyone who has left New York over the last few days, because of the rate of the number of cases, you may have been exposed before you left New York.

DANIEL DAE KIM REVEALS HE'S 'PRACTICALLY BACK TO NORMAL' AFTER TESTING POSITIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS On the drug front, there's more promising news, knock on sanitized wood. Researchers are reporting on a combo of anti-malarial meds and antibiotics, which were prescribed to coronavirus patients, and saw a significant reduction in the viral load in them. Meanwhile, anecdotal evidence, straight from patients' mouths, are attesting to its success. Actor Daniel Dae Kim, who got the virus and the drugs, said, ""Here’s what I consider to be the secret weapon: hydroxychloroquine. Yes, this is the drug that the president mentioned the other day. It is also that Dr. Anthony Fauci cautioned us about. He said that evidence was promising is anecdotal. And that is correct. It means it wasn’t studied, and it's only based on personal accounts. Well, add my name to those personal accounts, because I am feeling better."" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER How did the media respond? Well, President Trump touted it on Twitter, so what do you expect? Bloomberg News published a piece with the headline ""Virus Drug Touted by Trump, Musk Can Kill With Just Two Gram Dose.” They neglected to point out that two grams of a lot of things can kill you. Once again, the media, who love to tout their faith in science, flunked remedial math. Back to the good news. If we can treat people and reduce mortality even more, then not only can we save lives, we can also save our economy.

40,FOX,"California and New York tell tens of millions of non-essential workers to stay at home as Illinois instructs residents to shelter in place; reaction on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" March 20, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Jesse Watters along with Juan Williams, Dana Perino, Greg Gutfeld, and Emily Compagno. It's five o'clock in New York City. And this is The Five.  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Hey, knock it off.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Once that virus is defeated, Steve, I think everything else falls in place very rapidly. I think you're going to have a tremendous upswing. You're going to have a very steep, like a rocket ship, it's going to go up and everything will be back. And I really believe we'll going to be stronger than ever.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: President Trump is confident the economy will bounce back as the number of U.S. coronavirus cases rises. Right now, over 16,000 people are infected and more than 210 are dead. Two of the country's biggest states responding to the crisis by aggressively trying to stop the spread.  California and New York telling tens of millions of nonessential workers stay-at-home. Illinois also instructing residents to shelter in place. Across the country, hospitals warning there is a shortage of ventilators.  President Trump is saying companies are ramping up production in response. The president also furthering restricting international travel banning all nonessential movement across our northern and southern borders.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: These new rules and procedures will not impede lawful trade and commerce. Furthermore, Mexico is taking action to secure our own southern border and suspend air travel from Europe.  The actions were taken together with our north American partners. We'll save countless lives.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: And the president clashing with the press over the possible use of a malaria drug to treat the virus. The FDA has said it is unknown if the drug will actually work.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is it possible that your impulse to put a positive spin on things maybe giving Americans a false sense of hope --  (CROSSTALK)  TRUMP: No, I don't think so. No, I don't think so. I think it has --  (CROSSTALK)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, they'll not yet put a drug.  TRUMP: That's such a lovely question. Look, it may not work and it may not work.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What do you say to Americans who are watching you right now who are scared?  TRUMP: I'd say that you're a terrible reporter. That's what I say. And I think that's a very nasty question and I think it's a very bad signal that you are putting out to the American people.  The American people are looking for answers and they're looking for hope. If you want to get back to reporting instead of sensationalism, let's see if it works. It might and it might not. I happen to feel good about it but who knows, I've been right a lot.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: So, Greg, let me ask you. There is a dynamic that's going on with the press and the president where the president will say we don't know if it's going to work, we don't know if it's not going to work, drugs, the recovery, vaccine or anything. But I'm optimistic about it and I have hope. And then the press says, you are giving the American people false hope by being hopeful. How do you explain that?  GUTFELD: I think that you need there always needs to be a balance between the optimism and the concern. And sometimes you make a mistake here and you correct it quickly but there is actually good news on the drug and treatment front. But you don't want to run on the drugs which is why you always have to be cautious about what you are saying.  I looked at the research, there is research out there on this antimalarial drug that is promising. So, that's good news. And we're seeing unity on all fronts that people who don't normally unite. You're seeing mistakes corrected, you've seen people looking forward and not backward.  And the upside I think that, you know, I'm thinking a lot about this economic problem. It's artificial, noncyclical, it's unnatural which means we created it through this shutdown, and we can uncreate it.  Now the negative part for me as if we go too far into it, it's going to be harder to climb back out. I have -- I'm confident that it will roar back but overall, if we continue -- this is not -- it's wrong to accuse people of being insensitive if they are worried about the economy because the economy affects 340 million people.  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: In the world.  GUTFELD: In the world. So, we have to, at some point we're going to have to choose the economy over the clamp down, right? It's going to happen. And I think right now we bought ourselves time. I think we did a great job slowing the spread, but we now must consider the ramifications of extending this kind of shut down for long periods of time.  I don't want to have -- guess what I'm saying is I don't want to have lasting damage that might really, really harm people. I'm hoping that we pull back and we can get back on our feet.  WATTERS: Yes. Juan, it's a very tough balance to strike and the governors of California and New York they've taken matters into their own hands because those are the two real hot spots right now for the virus. They are calling for a full-on shutdown for the foreseeable future, a week or two weeks, we don't know.  Where does the rest of the country respond? Because as Greg said, if you shut down everything everywhere that's going to create more damage than it would buy kind of seeing how it plays out in certain areas.  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: I don't know if you heard of, but I sigh, Jesse, because I think this is like, you know, we're, you know, a rock and a hard place here.  WATTERS: Right.  WILLIAMS: I think the president even had praise for Governor Newsom of California and Governor Cuomo of New York and being proactive and I think we are seeing a lot of proactive steps being taken by local leadership.  But to your point, you know, we got to, you know, sort of get back on the saddle and ride the horse. The problem is Dr. Fauci said today, it's not going to be a matter of two weeks, it's going to be several weeks or possibly a month.  I don't know how. You know, it's hard to somehow say, well, here's how we make sense of this because you don't want people to get sick and you can't take the risk of having a rapid spread. This week what we seen in Italy has just been devastating. So, there's a real health issue.  But I would say that, you know, I think the president is now taking it seriously. I saw today poll numbers that show his approval rating in terms of people saying he's doing a better job of handling the coronavirus is now a majority to the American people.  So, from my perspective he's taking this seriously. Now the pivot has been made and I think the American people appreciate it, from my perspective I wish he might have done it a little sooner. But he's done it.  And I think that once we have confidence in our leadership, I think it's then, it's not that we can lay out the road map at this juncture but I think we are such a proactive and self-reliant people. That's our nature as Americans. We can make this happen. Just don't fall -- don't fall into your cups and start crying. You might sigh like me a little bit.  WATTERS: Dana, to Juan's point, I mean there has been a pivot from in tone and in aggressive action from the White House. It's hard to say how far you push it and that's really the balancing act that they have to deliver on.  PERINO: And it's hard for us to -- it's hard for me I should say, to comment on it, because we don't have the full information. Dr. Fauci on Bill Hemmer show today said that they are briefing the president every single day. They have a lot more information than we do.  However, I do think they are giving as much information to us as they possibly can. I mean, two-hour briefings every day that's like almost unheard of. So, we're getting a lot of information. But we don't have the full perspective.  And we know that next week is going to be tough. It's going to be really tough because that's -- now if you are working from home and now your kids are there at the second week and like the first week is a little bit of a novelty and everyone is figuring it out, the second week it could be like, OK. Mom, can you stop being so loud when you are on your conference call? The dogs are annoying, everybody -- like everyone is going to get tired.  But also, we know because there's more testing, the numbers are going to go up, we're going to see hospitalizations, we're going to see some increase in numbers.  So, I think that the White House, you know, in terms of preparing everybody for another rough week on the health side is something. To the point Greg was making on the economy, it's not something that we are going solve here on The Five. There are really smart people in Washington, in New York, and across the country trying to figure this out, but you cannot have the country not go back to work for seven months.  GUTFELD: No.  PERINO: And I don't think that's what Dr. Fauci was saying. I think what he was saying is that the spread, if we flatten the curve the spread could last a little bit longer.  But I don't think he was saying that you are going to have to stay in your homes for seven months, that wasn't the intention. This initial 15-day period is to try to do what we need to do which is to flatten the curve so it's for a longer period of time, so that we look more like South Korea and not Italy.  WATTERS: And Emily, it really is about awareness. The more people that are aware of what they have to do personally, individually to stop the spread, I think that's when the curve really gets flatter.  EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS HOST: Right. And I think, you know, speaking -- obviously I'm in Seattle today. So just to share a little bit of perspective from the west coast. Let's take California, for example.  So, there are estimates that about 60,000 of their homeless population would be infected with this, 12,000 of which will require hospital beds. And that's the kind of population, to your point, Jesse, that they can't -- they don't really engage in those mitigation fundamental things that we're all doing, like hand washing and social distancing.  So that's the kind of thing that could really lead to an eruption that Seattle also has a similar problem too. And to your guy's point about the economy, the biggest thing I am seeing here in Seattle is a decimation of the businesses.  WATTERS: Yes.  COMPAGNO: February here in Seattle saw the lowest unemployment rate since 1969 and the second week of March here there were 281,000 filings for unemployment insurance. California averages 2,000 a day, yesterday they saw 80,000.  And just in terms of kind of a quick specificity on this, the restaurant industry that's a $900 billion industry. So, for the criticisms we're hearing of the GOP's stimulus bill from the Democrats saying, look, it's all about the corporations not the worker, what does it matter if you invest in an individual if there is no job for them to return to? Tis is literally 5 percent of our GDP that we need to keep afloat somehow.  WATTERS: Yes, tough times ahead. I think everyone is bracing for next week pretty strongly.  All right. Up next, a congressional stock scandal. Four senators selling off millions right before the virus crash the economy.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WILLIAMS: Welcome back. It's a congressional stock scandal. Four U.S. senators now under fire for selling off millions of dollars worth of stocks in the days before the coronavirus crashed the American economy.  Democrat Dianne Feinstein and Republicans Richard Burr, Kelly Loeffler and James Inhofe all dumped assets following a reportedly classified all senators briefing at the end of January.  Now all four of the senators are denying any wrongdoing and Senator Burr is calling for an ethics review of his own actions. Senator Loeffler was grilled this morning by Fox's Ed Henry on America's newsroom.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: You thought the governor was prepared, yet shortly after that tweet that I just noted, you sold over million dollars in stocks in your own personal portfolio before the market went down. Were you trading on inside information about what was coming?  SEN. KELLY LOEFFLER (R-GA): Well, I'm really glad you asked, Ed, because I do want to set the record straight. I've seen some of those stories, and it's absolutely false and it could not be true. So, if you actually look at the personal transaction reports that were filed it notices at the bottom that I'm only informed of my transactions after they occur several weeks.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: So, I mean, it's hard to make sense of all of this. So, let me start by asking you, Jesse, is this serious? In the Loeffler case it's also an issue that not only does she sell stuff, but then she bought stuff and one of the items she bought was to help people who have to work at home, software. What do you think?  WATTERS: It looks really bad it, all four of them have different levels of sketchiness. I'll start with the least sketchy, Inhofe says he was never even at the briefing on the virus and said he's been moving money from stocks to mutual funds for the last two years. He sold the least amount of stock.  Feinstein says, you know what, it was a blind trust, it was my husband's doing. I wasn't even at the briefing on the virus either and it was just one company. But it was $6 million in a biotech company, we don't really know much else about that that.  Now Loeffler, her husband is the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange.  WILLIAMS: Yes.  WATTERS: She sold these stocks on the day of the briefing. Right after it happened. And like you said not only did she sell a lot of stocks. She bought a stock which benefits from a software that helps teleworking. People that work from home. It doesn't look very good. Perfectly timed.  Also perfectly timed, Richard Burr liquidated almost his entire portfolio. And he has all the intel because he is the top intel guy on the Senate and he was telling people privately that this pandemic was going to be as bad as the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic.  Also perfectly timed it right for the market dropped and he said, well, I traded it before because I saw some news on CNBC. I think everybody needs to be investigated and treated fairly but a really bad look.  WILLIAMS: Emily, Senator Burr says simply, you know what, it wasn't my actions even if you were to try to put them together. The fact is, he says, he had no special intelligence although he's the chairman of the intelligence committee. He says everything that he did was based on public reports. What do you think?  COMPAGNO: Right. He said I only listen to his CNBC covering the Asian markets. Look, in my opinion to kind of go off of Jesse's like ranking of the outlaws. The top two are the worst and Senator Burr is the worst by far. It's worse than Loeffler and here's why.  Because his reported net worth two years ago was 1.7 million. And as you just said he sold off between 600,000 and 1.7 million. So nearly all of his reported net worth, and of course, the disparity between his public and his private comments and his vote in 2012 against a rule in Congress banning insider trading --  WATTERS: Yes.  COMPAGNO: -- it obviously raises a lot of questions. And Loeffler right away her reported net worth is 500 million and the most she reportedly sold off was 3.1 million. So that's less than 1 percent.  She has the same defense that Feinstein does which is, I didn't know about it, I learned about it weeks after. You know, Feinstein says it's a blind trust, other people do it for me. But we'll see what happens.  WILLIAMS: Well, Greg, what do you think? I mean, you are normally a skeptic and I know public officials sometimes angry.  GUTFELD: Yes.  WILLIAMS: So, what are you thinking about this?  GUTFELD: I am more upset I guess at all of them for not knowing more about the issue in general. Yes, I agree with everything that Jesse and Emily said about the levels of guilt. But I'm kind of ticked off. What was -- what date was that meeting? It was end of January end of February?  DANA: January.  WATTERS: January 24th.  GUTFELD: OK. That was -- we did, we talked on The Five.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: That was right when the president was shutting down the travel.  GUTFELD: Yes, exactly. So, they could --  WILLIAMS: Wow.  GUTFELD: -- they could argue that they watched The Five and heard us arguing about it -- that's what I would do if I was her lawyer. But my point --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: Instead, they said they watched CNBC.  GUTFELD: Yes. Exactly. So, screw it. But I guess the thing is I'm just -- two things. I'm more upset that these people weren't on the ball two or three weeks earlier and could have -- and could have acted more for the American people than their stock portfolio.  But I'm also just ticked off in general at the stock market and the instability and frantic emotional response they are. Every day, I mean, today it swung from 800 up, to 900 down. And it's like I feel like I'm around a drunk, you know, driving down the middle-of-the-road. It's like can we drugged the stock market, can we drugged them for a month and put them to sleep and wake them up when this is over?  WILLIAMS: It's a roller coaster.  GUTFELD: Yes.  WILLIAMS: Dana, you know, you know what struck me was this report, Jesse touched on it that Burr was in a private luncheon at the Capitol Hill club in D.C. and he says to his guest this is going to be like the 1918 pandemic. So how can he now say that he didn't know what was going to come?  PERINO: In addition, he wrote an op-ed piece that basically saying the U.S. is prepared. OK? So, the interesting thing is, this is why people get mad about this.  Up until 2012, insiders trading by people that are members of Congress was not even illegal. OK? And there was funny business going on and so there was this loss. So, the stock act comes into play, they have to report, and this is the thing.  I mean, think about, I can't remember his name the congressman from upstate New York who makes the -- or sends the text message from the White House on the South Lawn where they are having a congressional picnic telling his family, hey, you might want to sell this stock.  WILLIAMS: Yes.  PERINO: Like they get caught. And maybe -- I think here's what I would do. If I were ever going to be a member of Congress, I would want to not know.  GUTFELD: Exactly.  PERINO: I would want to put it in a blind trust so that you just not even have the possibility --  GUTFELD: Yes, what do you think.  PERINO: -- of a perception that like this. I mean, if this ends any careers, it's a terrible, terrible legacy.  WILLIAMS: Well, now that you've said it, I don't know what I'm going to do with my vote for Perino button, but you know.  PERINO: You will never have to wear it.  WILLIAMS: All right. Up next, President Trump calling out China as the country tries to reshape its global image amid the coronavirus update. Stay with The Five.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  COMPAGNO: Welcome back. After covering up the coronavirus outbreak, China is now trying recast itself as the global leader in the fight against the pandemic. Some members of the media are all too happy to carry water for the communist regime. Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: China now stepping into the global leadership role long abandoned by the American president.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: China and South Korea and those Asian countries, Hoda, may have helped western Europe and America by delaying the arrival of the coronavirus here but now they are worrying that they may get re-infected by the coronavirus from the rest of the world.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In China, the government attacked in the epidemic center of Wuhan. City officials built two hospitals with than 2,000 beds in the span of a few weeks.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  COMPAGNO: Greg, let's start with you. You always feel strongly about media coverage. What are your thoughts on this?  GUTFELD: Well, the media is a narrative- driven industry and the fact is most narratives aren't true. Because in order to create a story you have to -- you have to play with things and you shape it into something that's interesting. And sometimes I don't even believe they are aware that they are doing it.  The problem is now the people just want facts and they want hope. So, this narrative that they are now shifting to was created by clever editors who were removed from the reality on the street. So, they actually I don't even know the harm that they are doing.  So, like and I would even include like we are all getting paychecks right now. The media is -- the media is not going to suffer through this. No matter what happens out there we'll going to get our paychecks.  And I think -- that's why it's like, their narratives about China have little effect on their jobs. It's not going to hurt them. But it may hurt other people who are going to be out of work and struggling in the next two weeks. And I think we have to start thinking about those people and the kinds of stories that will help them. If that makes sense.  COMPAGNO: Dana, what are your -- it makes sense. Dana, what are your thoughts on this?  PERINO: He always makes sense. No, did I just say that?  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: I had to drink in the commercial break. You know why, Jesse.  WATTERS: I know.  PERINO: OK.  GUTFELD: Coconut water, coconut water from Jesse's assistant.  PERINO: So, here's the thing. The media did a pretty good job talking about what China was doing. Think about the stories that we heard about that they were using Uyghurs --  WATTERS: Yes.  PERINO: -- to have to go and work in the factories as slaves labor as Chinese got to stay home to protect themselves from coronavirus. They don't care what happens to the Uyghurs. How did I even know about that? I know because the reporters were reporting on it.  And there's a lot of different places to get your information. Find the ones you trust and do that. But this is what I would say to journalists everywhere. And I think they're instinctively think to do this, don't always look here in America for the story. Look there. Look to help the Chinese journalists who are trying to figure out a way to get around the censors because they care about their citizens. It's not the Chinese people themselves.  GUTFELD: Right.  PERINO: They are the victims of a regime that is horrendous. And Xi -- President Xi is a very different leader than the one who came before him. He was a little bit more open like let's try capitalism. This is a whole different thing now. The technology is different.  I would just suggest to the extent possible that we can to help those Chinese journalists figure out a way to tell us stories that we need to hear from the inside.  COMPAGNO: So, Jesse, what are your thoughts on the fact that the regime, as Dana pointed out, has just exonerated the one of the original Chinese doctors, who at that time they vilified and he ended up dying from corona from the coronavirus COVID-19 because they -- he sounded the alarm and they didn't let him.  WATTERS: It's too little too late. It's just another cover-up in a long line of cover-ups. It just reminds me of Bernie Sanders, you know, finding the silver lining in a communist regime. I mean, Dana said it right. They forced labor to fight this virus. They use their surveillance state to invade people's privacy and facial recognition technology to monitor where it went. They held people at gunpoint in quarantine in a city of 11 million people.  So, if the U.S. media wants to praise that, I mean, fine, but that's crazy. And Dana's point, again, is accurate. If you just read the media in the United States' own reporting on China, why don't they listen to their own reporting. They've even said that the Chinese Communist government quashed the scientific community, made them destroy lab samples, lied to the WHO about how contagious this was, and then smeared the U.S. military for planting this virus in China. And now they're just showering the rest of the world with propaganda and soft money to separate the word virus from China.  It's so clear. I just -- I don't know why, as Greg said, why they didn't see that they're being used by the Chinese government.  COMPAGNO: Juan, take us home.  WILLIAMS: Well, I mean, you know, look, even though most rotten totalitarian communist government, which spies on its own people and invades their privacy can do good things and maybe they are trying to do some good things now. But it doesn't take away from the damage that they've done.  I mean, as we sit here this Friday afternoon, we don't know so much about how this started, how many people were infected. We don't know about treatment plans, we -- you know, and they could be providing us with data that would help us in our struggle going on right now. They're not dealing with us in that way. I think they're trying to again improve their image here in places like Africa, but it's -- and even in Europe, but they're not being straight to this moment.  And so, to my mind, I think it would be good if they somehow were to change. I find it very frustrating to deal with the Chinese government in all circumstances, but right now, I think they're a threat to all of our health.  COMPAGNO: All right, thank you. Don't go anywhere, you guys. The ""FASTEST SEVEN"" is up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PERINO: Welcome back. Time for the ""FASTEST SEVEN."" First up, thinking about going to a restaurant or bar this weekend? OK, well take a tip from the Terminator. Stay inside.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER, FORMER GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA: Yes, I'm at home dipping at jacuzzi, smoke and old stogie. I still see photographs and videos of people sitting in outside cafes all over the world and having a good time and hanging out in crowds. That is not wise because that's how you can get the virus.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: Schwarzenegger says he's leading by example with a series of Coronavirus PSA's featuring his furry friends. Greg, you're shaking your head.  GUTFELD: No, no, no. And I love Arnold.  PERINO: What, no on this doggy?  GUTFELD: No, I'm just no on him, and I'll tell you why. I like I love Arnold Schwarzenegger, but screw him on this. Because there's something wrong, and I'm quoting Kat Timpf, for the super-rich to endure or survive a shutdown because he's not getting laid off, right? It's easy for him to sit --  PERINO: And he has an outdoor hot tub.  GUTFELD: Yes, he's got a hot tub, he's got his stogie, Mr. Rich Fatty Pants sitting there telling people that you got to stay inside. Well, he's got a massive house, he's got help, he could order a caviar and pig's feet, and I just -- I don't want to hear that from him. And I'm saying that is somebody who doesn't have to worry either. I don't want to hear it.  PERINO: Do you know who I think has done an excellent job, Jesse, of this kind of thing, are the college football coaches.  WATTERS: Yes.  PERINO: Have you seen any of those?  WATTERS: I have, but I'm worried for Greg. Next time the Terminator runs into him, he's going to crush you like a girly man.  GUTFELD: I don't know. He looks --  WATTERS: You are dead, man. You are dead.  GUTFELD: He looks pretty soft. He looks pretty soft, Jesse.  WATTERS: Again, those are fighting words, Gutfeld. I haven't seen you with your shirt off but I can imagine it's not like that.  GUTFELD: Go to my Web site.  WATTERS: We have to pay?  GUTFELD: No. It's behind the firewall.  WATTERS: Is that free?  PERINO: He pays you.  WATTERS: I don't know. I think it's a good thing. Like you said, get the -- get the coaches, get Kylie Jenner, get Tom Brady, get LeBron, get them all out there to tell people to knock it off and stay home.  PERINO: Juan?  WILLIAMS: Well, I think it's a great illustration of you know, stay at home, it's not great, but love life, enjoy life to the most. I mean, I think that's an upbeat message. But I got to agree with Greg. You know, it's hard to feel sympathy for the super-rich in their hot tubs smoking a cigar, you know, when people are struggling now, in some cases having been laid off to deal with paying bills, or the kids screaming.  You know, and by the way, I too love Arnold Schwarzenegger, but it's just hard. I mean, you just think, boy, this is a different standard.  PERINO: Well, we've had -- we got to get this moving on. We've had Schwarzenegger up there for five minutes. I don't want to see that picture again. Let me ask you, Emily, who would you most like to hear from?  COMPAGNO: Well, I thought the cutest thing ever was Anthony Hopkins video. Did you guys see?  PERINO: Oh, I have it to look later.  COMPAGNO: First of all, what I learned -- OK, you have to watch it. So he wanted to be a composer, and instead he sort of fell into acting in college, but he's basically playing the piano and it's beautiful. And his cat is on his lap an he's like smiling at her. It's adorable.  But yes, Arnold Schwarzenegger is exactly why people hate Californians too, because the person in the 200 square foot, you know, New York apartment with snow outside the window is like the thread of computer out the window.  PERINO: All right, next, grocery stores might be all out of toilet paper and chicken, but there are lots of lonely items that no one seems to be buying. Some shoppers noting that vegan foods, pork rinds, and okra are in great supply. I also saw Greg, that there was frozen pizza wiped out, except for the one with pineapple on top.  GUTFELD: OK, so you know what? This has been the most informative moment for food companies in industries. You have the greatest arena for analysis of likes and dislikes. Walk into a supermarket and you will know precisely what people like about your product.  Like for example, all the Pringles were gone except buffalo ranch flavored, and that's the woman I really like. So I'm lucky. And also, stuffed olives. Nobody is buying the stuffed olives. I love stuffed olives.  PERINO: Jesse, as you've made your way to the grocery store, what have you seen on the shelves?  WATTERS: I want to clear up something that happened on yesterday's show involving --  PERINO: Coconut water.  WATTERS: Yes, we're going to coconut water gate. I did not know there was a coconut water shortage. So when I was asking my assistant Johnny to grab some coconut water, I didn't realize that I was hoarding coconut water. I just want to clear that up.  WILLIAMS: Wow.  PERINO: Juan, what are -- what are your kids or your grandkids, what are they desperate for at the grocery store that might not be --  WILLIAMS: Well, you know, those lucky charms are pretty popular especially with sugar high for kids caught at home. It's not popular with their parents once the sugar high kicks in. But you know what's interesting is that people are buying non-perishable items like cereal. Everybody likes their breakfast cereal, But when you go, you look at the vegetables and the perishable items, they're sitting there. I wonder about that.  GUTFELD: Exactly.  PERINO: Emily, what do you look for when you go to the grocery store these days?  COMPAGNO: Recently, tomato soup which was all out. And I've noticed that cream of mushroom soup is plentiful. No one is buying that.  PERINO: I know -- I know like kale soup, no on -- well, I'm going to do something this weekend. I'm actually going to make food for Jasper. So I'm going to make food for Peter. I'm making food for Jasper. We're going to see how that goes. I could learn a new skill.  GUTFELD: Oh, man.  PERINO: Don't go anywhere. ""FAN MAIL FRIDAY"" is next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: Any way you want it for ""FAN MAIL FRIDAY."" First question from Matthew. What has been the best thing you've made out of this bad situation during isolation? Emily?  COMPAGNO: All of the time with my dog by the lake and connecting with others down there from six feet away.  GUTFELD: OK, yes, keep your distance. What about you, Juan?  WILLIAMS: I'm back in the supermarket, Greg. I never go to the supermarket, and I'm at the supermarket. And let me tell you. My neighborhood has changed. I can't believe who lives in my gentrified neighborhood now.  GUTFELD: All those damn white people, Juan.  WILLIAMS: I'm telling you, man.  WATTERS: Yes, time to move.  GUTFELD: I'm afraid, Jesse. What have you -- what's the best thing you've made out of this bad situation?  WATTERS: I haven't made anything. My wife has made dinner. She learned how to cook and she'd never cooked before. And now last night she made miso glazed salmon.  PERINO: Wow, she's like jumping right in.  WATTERS: Yes, strip steaks with peppercorn, so I'm living large and getting large.  GUTFELD: Dana?  PERINO: I think the best thing for me has been I've been home every night.  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: And so, Peter and I have dinner together. Jasper is there. We watch -- we're watching Wild Wild Country on Netflix. I didn't even know that happened in America. Did you see it.  GUTFELD: No, I haven't. Now I'm going to look it up. You know, I have -- I am losing what -- I am now to Greg 2011, OK. I'm 2011.  PERINO: When I met you.  GUTFELD: Yes, when you met me. Skinny Greg is back, and you know who I'm going to thank, Ben from Peloton.  PERINO: Thank you, Ben.  GUTFELD: What's her name?  PERINO: Leann.  GUTFELD: Leann from Peloton. I'm so addicted to that. It's a cult. It is a cult.  PERINO: Well, it's better than the culture in Wild Wild Country.  WATTERS: Can we see pictures of you -- and can we see pictures of you on your Web site if we go check that out?  GUTFELD: Yes, exactly. I'll be shirtless.  WATTERS: OK, good.  GUTFELD: OK. What is the dumbest advice you have ever received? This is from Barney. Dana, dumbest advice?  PERINO: Dumbest advice.  GUTFELD: I could almost give you one that I heard.  PERINO: What?  GUTFELD: I can't because the person doesn't work here anymore. Remember?  PERINO: No.  GUTFELD: A certain host gave you some advice.  PERINO: I don't remember.  GUTFELD: All right, I'll tell you in the break.  PERINO: Oh my gosh, I don't know. Dumb advice, dumb advice, I don't know. I'm drawing a blank. I'm sorry.  GUTFELD: All right. It was something about what you should be wearing. But anyway, Jesse, worst advice you've ever received?  WATTERS: Worst advice? Follow your instincts, Jesse. It's always good to, you know, slow things down and think about it before you do it.  GUTFELD: Juan, worst advice you've ever received in your life?  WILLIAMS: Boy, there's so much, I don't know where to start, Greg. I really don't -- you know, it's a great question. But I mean, you know, at this point in my life, I'd have to like create a catalogue. It could be a book.  PERINO: You remember the good advice that you got. You don't remember the bad.  GUTFELD: I know a bad -- I know a advice. Emily, bad advice?  COMPAGNO: I think a lot of -- a lot of noes. Like you're too small to do this, you are a girl and can't do this, and so that just obviously set me to be more determined than ever and prove them all wrong.  GUTFELD: The dumbest advice I ever received was be yourself. Wait until you're -- wait until you're successful to be yourself. Don't be yourself when you're poor. It isn't going to work. So wait until you're making money and you got a steady job and then be the hell of yourself. I don't even know if that makes sense.  PERINO: No.  GUTFELD: Oh, this is the opposite. What is the most uplifting thing someone has told you? Jesse?  WATTERS: I have great hair.  GUTFELD: Well, at least it was something substantive. Juan, what was the most uplifting thing someone has told you?  WILLIAMS: Well, apart from I love you, I think that there was an editor who once said to me, you know, you can write a note to the milkman. And I was like, thank you. Thank you very much. Because you know what, that's harder than you might think.  GUTFELD: Yes, that's true. Dana, have you ever had to write a note to a milkman?  PERINO: I don't think so. But now I feel like I should. I think the best advice I ever got is -- so I met Peter on an airplane --  GUTFELD: No, the most uplifting thing.  PERINO: Uplifting thing anyone ever told -- well, you said it was the opposite of the worst advice you ever got.  GUTFELD: Right, right, right.  PERINO: The most uplifting thing. Well, I've been doing this Storytime with Dana at 3:30 p.m. on Facebook Live and to know that a lot of my friends and people I've never met before, are watching with their kids and sending me notes that they appreciate it, that's been good.  GUTFELD: Emily, are you -- did I ask you yet? No, did I ask you, Emily?  COMPAGNO: What? No.  GUTFELD: OK.  COMPAGNO: No, no, you haven't asked me yet. So I have a story from this morning. And it's sort of -- it's sort of it relates. But the other day, I found a leash in the grass and so I hung it on a sign, like here for whoever remembers this and comes back looking for it.  And then the next day, I lost one of Duchess's bows because you guys know, I put a different bow on her every day. And then today, I saw her bow was put on that leash. So all of us who go to that same park, we're all looking out for each other, and I thought that was uplifting and totally sweet that my bow was put on the leash.  WATTERS: Great story, Emily.  PERINO: Dog park story are the best.  GUTFELD: The uplifting thing to me was somebody left a comment on my Web site saying I look great. Thanks, Lucy. ""ONE MORE THING"" up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WATTERS: It's time now for ""ONE MORE THING."" Dana?  PERINO: So, Chino Hills High School Chamber Singers, they're supposed to have a concert that got canceled, but that didn't stop them from performing online. Take a look.  So they did this all online. It raised nearly half a million people and they're really enterprising young people. Sorry your concert got canceled but congratulations there.  WATTERS: The screen looks like our show.  PERINO: Yes. I like that. That's a big -- that's a CNN panel. I also want to say happy birthday, early birthday. My sister's birthday is tomorrow. Angie is -- well, I won't tell you her age. Her birthday is tomorrow. And birthdays in the time of coronavirus are a little bit you know, different. And so we'll have FaceTime or something and cheers with you tomorrow, Angie. Happy birthday.  WATTERS: Happy birthday, Ange.  GUTFELD: Happy birthday.  WATTERS: All right, Greg.  GUTFELD: All right, tomorrow night, the ""GREG GUTFELD SHOW."" You're going to love it. You got Dagen McDowell, Dana Perino --  PERINO: Oh, my gosh.  GUTFELD: Kat Timpf, Tyrus is back, Saturday, March 21st 10:00 p.m. Now let's do this. It's been a while.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Animals are great. Animals are great. Animals are great.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: A lot of technologies coming in because of this whole thing. Now you can walk your dog with -- at a distance. Check this dog being walked by a drone.  PERINO: I have a question about this.  GUTFELD: What?  PERINO: What happens if the dog goes number two? Can the drone pick that up? Because that's a very important part of being a responsible dog walker.  GUTFELD: You know, what the drone does? It looks both ways and runs. That's what I do after number two. By the way, that's disgusting. Anyway, this would be the future, could be permanent, no need for dog walkers.  PERINO: Keep all the dog walkers and pay them even if you can't be there with them.  GUTFELD: That's true.  WATTERS: All right, so now there's no sports on television so no one knows what to bet on. So people are betting on some pretty wacky stuff. Watch this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You have big money. You're betting on the weather because you can bet on sports?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sports. 500 to rain.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: Yes, he took the rain. He should have gone with the sun. Not a good look. He lost 500 bones.  GUTFELD: Wow.  WATTERS: One thing I can bet on though is ""WATTERS' WORLD"" 8:00 p.m. Saturday night. We have two Spring Breakers who were down in Florida partying during the pandemic. We'll find out if they regret what they did.  GUTFELD: They're going to regret doing your show.  WATTERS: That's always the case.  WILLIAMS: No, no, no, but I hope they don't come into the studio.  WATTERS: Well, we did the remote, Juan.  WILLIAMS: Good, good.  WATTERS: I'm social distancing, even my guests. Juan, you're up.  WILLIAMS: All right, so you know, we all been washing our hands and as we do it, we sing happy birthday. So today, I'm well practice as I say, Happy Birthday to Syracuse's Kathleen Burns. She turns 95 on Saturday. But because of the coronavirus, the big party had to be canceled. Her family though came up with a loving alternative. Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Happy Birthday to you.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: The performance was a big surprise for Mrs. Burns. It's not a party, but she hopes her party is going to take place sometime soon. She has seven sons, 22 grandchildren, 29 great-grandchildren, and she's got a bunch of fans here on THE FIVE. Happy Birthday Mrs. Burns.  WATTERS: Juan, you know what we should start doing? We should start betting on your ""ONE MORE THINGS.""  WILLIAMS: Oh, yes. But Jesse, you'd have inside information.  WATTERS: No, like if they involve like a grandparent or involving a birthday.  WILLIAMS: Yes, I like that. Yes.  WATTERS: We're going to do that next week.  WILLIAMS: But no peeking. You peak and then you know, it'd be like --  WATTERS: I'm not Richard Burr. Emily.  COMPAGNO: OK, so you know how Kevin Bacon used to do the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon or the whole world did? Watch his newly challenge for everyone for COVID-19. Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  KEVIN BACON, ACTOR: While you stay at home, you need to post a video or a sign like this one, saying who you're going to stay home for and you tag six friends so they can do the same. And since we're all connected by various degrees, trust me, I know, we can work together to stay home and keep each other safe.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: Better than the Imagine song.

41,FOX,"COVID-19 pandemic hasn't stopped some breakers; reaction on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" March 19, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everyone. I am Dana Perino, along with Jesse Watters, Juan Williams, and Greg Gutfeld, and Dagen McDowell. It is 5:00 in New York City, and this is The Five. All right, so we are going to catch you up. The federal government and states are ramping up responses to the Coronavirus outbreak.  Cases in the United States hitting a milestone with an increase in testing, over 10,000 Americans are infected, and more than 150 have died, and this just in, the State Department advising all Americans to avoid international travel. And earlier today, President Trump announcing that the FDA is fast tracking possible treatments for the virus, it includes a drug used to fight malaria, the president is cautiously optimistic. Take a look a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: And I've directed the FDA to eliminate outdated rules and bureaucracy so this work can proceed rapidly, quickly, and I mean, fast. And we have to remove every barrier. There are a lot of barriers that were unnecessary. And they've done that to get the rapid deployment of safe, effective treatments.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: And Americans struggling to deal with the economic fallout of the disease may be getting a much-needed boost. Senate Republicans moving very quickly to pass phase three of the Coronavirus stimulus package. The plan is worth upward of $1 trillion, and it would provide loans to small businesses and direct cash payments to Americans affected by the outbreak. Here is the president on that earlier.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: We are working with Congress to provide major additional relief to the workers, small businesses, and the hardest hit industries. We want to make sure that everybody is able to continue on. Some companies, as you know, did stock buybacks. And I was never happy with that. It's very hard to tell them not to, but I would tell them not to.  I can't say strongly enough. We will be helping small businesses. That's where it's complicated, because a lot of -- well, you know, that's the engine of the country. We will be helping small businesses.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: And the president had a little fun with the media's attempt at physical distancing.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: You're actually sitting too close. You should -- really, we should probably get rid of about another 75, 80 percent of you. Just two or three that I like in this room, I think that's a great way of doing it. We're just beginning a new way of doing it. But you're actually much too close. You should leave immediately.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: I don't know if the FDA commissioner, who was looking on, realized it was a joke. Because -- OK, I want to do three things here, I want to talk about the possible health benefits of the pharmaceutical companies working together and quickly at the president's direction with the FDA. I want to do economics. And then, of course, we can do a little bit of the politics if there is any today.  Greg, on the point about the FDA and trying to fast-track it, I mean, it still could take a while, the FDA commissioner said up to a year. But there is some promise that there are drugs that are on the market that maybe with a little modification could really help.  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: There's a -- actually, there's a lot of good news out there right now. That's why I was shaking my head about -- I don't care about the politics. There is good news that's kind of ironic that this will go on longer because the measures are working. If it's slowing the spread in intensity and flattening that steep peak, so it's more like a rolling hill. It will go on longer, but that's because it's working.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: -- and it doesn't overwhelm the --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Exactly. And so now you're talking about this anti-malarial drug, Chloroquine. It's been around for 70 years. So that means it's been -- humans can tolerate it. They know the side effects, so unlike a vaccine, it doesn't have to be, you know, tested for months and months. Bayer just donated three million tablets to the government.  So they have it. So that is also good news. The -- you know, you can argue that the predictions are gloomy, and they're gloomy in real. But they haven't factored in the human response. That's why I'm optimistic. All of these numbers that you hear are as if we did nothing, but you're seeing a lot of good news. You're seeing ingenuity.  You've got seven billion brains targeting one virus. I kind of feel bad for the virus. I think it's going to get destroyed. So the DOW is going to go up and down, because psychologically, we are all going up and down. I have to say this, though. When I'm sick -- and then I'll shut up, I am sick of me thinking that I'm sick all the time. Like, I swear --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: That's not new.  GUTFELD: No.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: This is why we have the pharmaceutical ads on Fox, I sing during the side effects. Because I don't -- yes, because I get so easily influenced by the news and this stuff. It's really hard not to think you have something when all you hear about is the sickness. And that's why you've got to go outside and go for walks by yourself and get away from the influx because it messes with your brain.  PERINO: And Dagen, tell me a little bit about the economic package that they're working on in the Congress right now, big enough, fast enough, and can we get it to the right people in time for them to be able to pay some of their bills? Since -- as the president said, this was no fault of their own.  DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, they are trying, because cash is the medicine that the economy needs. But on the individual side and on the business, the business side is a great deal more complicated, because you're talking about bailouts. Are we going to take equity stakes and say the airlines -- basically taxpayers going to own part of Delta Air Lines or American, and then it falls to the hands of politicians.  On the individual side, they are looking at trying to get checks out in a matter of weeks. It could be $1200 per person, $500 for a child, family of four. It would be about $3400. There would be a cut off, say, if you make 95 or $99,000 a year. You're not going to get anything. But I was communicating telepathically with Greg.  And I looked into this. I'm a huge fan girl. And I love Richard Rubin at the Wall Street Journal. How do they get the money to the people? And it's exceedingly complicated. In 2008, under President Bush, he signed the checks into law in February. They didn't even start going out until April. So you're talking about -- you could get benefits through the Social Security Administration, through the VA, if you get direct deposit.  PERINO: What we need is some whiz kid to figure out how to do Venmo to the people that need it from the Treasury Department.  MCDOWELL: There are 23 percent fewer people working in the IRS than a few years ago. There is nobody who understands Venmo.  PERINO: Well, can be innovative, Jesse. We can find somebody like Al Fair (ph) that's thinking about this. I mean, you did see a lot of companies that are figuring out how can they do the right thing, as Greg mentioned, Bayer donating the money. Some companies saying that they would be willing to change their production in order to manufacture some of the healthcare products that might be needed like ventilators and masks.  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, that's why the administration seems so inspired today. It's is because they've started to realize they have they to harness the power of the private sector. And they should've done that weeks ago. And they're beginning to do that now. The president's slashing a lot of red tape so you're getting fast-tracked.  Hopefully, therapies coming out soon, overseas therapies, experimental therapies, therapies for malaria that can be repackaged, so the market really responded today when they discussed that at the press conference. But just to put a little point on what Greg was saying, it's all about the vaccine. And remember the space race?  I mean, probably you do, Greg. You're a little bit older that I do. But, you know, we need a race for the vaccine, like the Manhattan Project where you get the sharpest brains in the country in a room working 24/7 around- the-clock, because the vaccine is the key. And you've got to get it out in under a year. That's absolutely critical.  And CEOs have stepped up, Carnival Cruise offering their ships for extra bedding off the coast. Construction CEOs donated masks. GM CEOs say you can build the ventilators in our facility. So that's a good thing. Mike Bloomberg stepped up to the plate and donated $40 million to fight Coronavirus. He spent about a half billion on a presidential campaign.  Maybe he could dig a little deeper in his pockets. But it is very clear that the president is focused on getting money to small business and workers, and that's the key.  PERINO: Indeed. And Juan, I had two quick questions for you. One is that I don't know if you saw, but Jerome Powell, the nation's surgeon general, he made a call out today to Americans to go consider going to give blood, because of all of this. And people staying homes, the blood banks across the country are really low. And he was saying it is safe to give blood, and we really need people to do that, so there's a call for that.  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: That's good news. I mean, we should have done so much of this long ago. I mean, to me, a lot of the actions that are now being taken by the White House should have been taken sometime before. And that's not a political analysis. I mean, it's just -- I mean, for example, if you look at a Republican like Governor DeWine in Ohio.  He has been proactive in terms of saying here's what we should be doing, in creating a model for lots of governors and mayors around the country.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: But isn't that where it's supposed to come from, though? I mean, in our system, the state and local governments are on the frontlines. And so they are the innovators.  WILLIAMS: I disagree. I think that what you need here is leadership from the top, because the top has the resources, just as we are talking with Dagen a moment ago about the money and trying to inject money into a faltering economy at this time. So much of it has to come from the federal leadership. And that's why when you see the president, you know, try to say, yeah.  You know, we knew this was coming. You say what, what is going on? He's just trying to distract. I think he denies a lot of this stuff. I think in a moment like this, you know, I think in my mind back to 9/11. After President Bush began to react with some empathy and also the capacity it seems to me to be honest at a moment of crisis with the American people.  You saw his poll numbers and the trust level just skyrocket, 90 percent. But today, I do think it's comparable. We are going through a crisis in our society. And what you see is that the trust coming from the American people is much lower in this situation, because the transparency is not there.  GUTFELD: You know when somebody says that, you know, something good should have been done sooner? It's absolutely meaningless, because all good things could be done sooner.  PERINO: And also, history has a long arc. And people will be able -- we are in the middle of a crisis right now and that will sort itself out.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: We couldn't keep the politics out for one damn block?  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: -- Tulsi Gabbard dropped out today, and nobody even noticed. OK, coming up, some positive developments in the fight against the Coronavirus, up next.  GUTFELD: Unbelievable.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WATTERS: The Coronavirus is creating a lot of fear and panic around the country. But there is some positive news. If you're worried about there being enough food at the grocery store, suppliers say there is plenty to go around and sold out items will be restocked, Ford and GM reportedly in talks to make rush orders of ventilators if needed.  And if China's telling the truth, for the first time since the outbreak began, there are no new cases in the city of Wuhan. And politicians appear to be getting along to solve the problem. Here's President Trump.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: (INAUDIBLE) the governors -- even Gavin Newsom who, you know, I am usually fighting with over the fires. And I think you should do a different kind of a job in the forest and lots of things, we argue a lot. But Gavin Newsom has been very, very generous. Andrew Cuomo has been really, very generous. I mean, they're saying we're doing a great job, and everybody is saying it.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: And even though he's running for president, Bernie Sanders says he doesn't have time to worry about it right now.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE)  SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We are dealing with a global crisis. And you're asking me these questions.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: Greg, you don't have a lot in common with Bernie Sanders. But maybe that is -- right there. I don't have time for politics right now.  GUTFELD: There you go. He actually understands the priority over politics is this. And by the way, we left out -- we have to give credit where credit is due. Ilhan Omar also praised Trump very strongly about his actions. Remember, like, four days ago? People were taking pictures of empty shelves. Now, we have people on Twitter taking pictures of full shelves, as if it's somehow magical.  No, it's America. It's industry. It's capitalism. Three cheers to our truck drivers, you know our farmers. Our -- and truck drivers who are self- distancing every day in a truck. I mean, what does it say about our system when in the midst of a crisis we can still eat and we can still function. Those shortages are artificial and short term.  People are running out of coconut water. I feel terrible about that. But I'm also happy, you know, when you see that we've eliminated red tape so that, you know, doctors can now practice over state lines. When we see how that works, that should be -- that should remain permanent. A lot of these positive things should become permanent. Like, Brian Kilmeade staying away from me is really positive.  WATTERS: You like the social distancing among anchors. Yes, I see that. How did you know that I had run out of coconut water?  GUTFELD: Because I saw your assistant bringing you a six-pack of it, you sick little man.  WATTERS: I need it for my smoothies. I've got to stay healthy. Dana, to Greg's point --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: -- this is not something I'd like to discuss on live television. Let's move on to the substance, Dana. As Greg said, even Ilhan Omar giving the president good marks, you combine that with the governors of New York and California. It seems like the country is rallying together and trying to get things done for the American people.  PERINO: Well, I mean -- we all knew this, like, underneath. Like, I think that the partisanship and the polarization in the country is quite exacerbated in our minds. I don't think that the country actually is as far apart as you think. And there's nothing like a crisis to focus the hearts and minds of people, including politicians and those in Washington.  I -- and they all need each other right now. The governors know that they absolutely need the president. And the president needs the governors to do what their responsibilities are at the frontlines, doing their innovative things, and trying to help them where he can, and then providing FEMA assistance. Like, that's how our system works.  And it's unfortunate that it takes a crisis to bring everybody together. But when we do it, we do it well. And this is a time also -- if I could just say one thing about the truckers. OK, so these are people who already are treated pretty badly in society, right? So it -- well, I shouldn't say all of them. But for example, right now, a lot of the rest areas are closed.  OK, where are they supposed to go if they need to rest, if they need to get some coffee? They need to use the restroom. A lot of rest rooms, they're closed. Well, we have to all think about this. The truckers are really important. And I know a lot of them listen to this show. I want you to know we are thinking about you.  And I hope that the government -- and I mean state governments can really think about how they can make our system work a little bit better for these people who are working so hard for us.  GUTFELD: Are you offering them your bathroom?  PERINO: I will let them use my bathroom, absolutely.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: You might regret that, Dana.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: I will not regret it. I will not let you use the restroom after all the coconut water.  WATTERS: OK. Yeah, I'm going to be in there for a while. Dagen, what do you think about the support that the president and governors have gotten from businesses throughout the country?  MCDOWELL: You know who gets a big woo-hoo, Greg Abbott of Texas, less than 24 hours ago. Restaurants in Texas can now deliver alcoholic beverages with food purchases to customers, not the only state that's doing it, but again, getting out of the way so these restaurants can stay in business. To Greg's point and to Dana's point, I've actually started stopping anybody who I know is humping it and on the job.  Restocking shelves, delivering packages, and just stopping them in the street, and saying I appreciate you. Thank you. And I've been tipping like a crazy person, actually just -- I am not joking. I've been handing out cash to people. If I've got a 20 in my pocket, I literally will give a UPS driver a fun ticket.  WATTERS: Oh, maybe I can deliver groceries to your apartment later.  PERINO: Maybe we should give it to your assistant for bringing coconut water.  WATTERS: OK, very good, Dana. Moving on, I should never have brought that up. Juan Williams, a lot of good things happening in this country that -- this country is a resilient nation. And the people are very resourceful and innovative. And I think the innovation and the ethic and the work ethic, that's what's going to be critical in recovering from this situation.  WILLIAMS: Yeah. We talk about heroes. I just wanted to talk about the doctors. Because to me, the doctors who are on the frontline and I, you know, have relatives working in emergency rooms. My brother-in-law is a big doctor here in D.C., my father-in-law. So these doctors are at tremendous risk for exposure to the virus.  Nonetheless, we have to keep them well. And they are being very brave, often times working extreme hours in order to staff these hospitals, emergency rooms, even some of these checkpoints that have been constructed to test people for the virus. So I just wanted to say hats off to them. The other part of this is I think you guys are so quick to talk about the governors.  And even now, apparently, you have a new favorite in Ilhan Omar. But I think a lot of the politicians in the country realize you've got to kiss up to the government right now, to president Trump and others, and the CDC and the rest, in order to get attention at a critical moment. And I think it's important to understand how that relationship of those very, you know, key gears like relationship can work.  But when you talk about giving out money, when you talk about bailouts for big business, gee, I think, this was the party that was running against socialism, running against Andrew Yang and Bernie Sanders just a few minutes ago.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: And I say this with all due respect.  WILLIAMS: Yeah.  WATTERS: You are really misreading the room.  WILLIAMS: Oh, yeah.  WATTERS: You are misreading the country.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: We are doing a segment about the positivity of Americans coming together from all walks of life, from the private sector to the public sector, from everyone. And you keep on ruining it. So maybe think about that after the commercial break.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: -- a little more positive, Juan.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: -- a little more positive in a time when the country really needs positivity, all right?  WILLIAMS: I think you should go listen to some of the Trump rallies.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: -- shut down spring break after college students went wild on the beach.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WILLIAMS: It looks like the party is over for spring breakers in Florida. They've been crowding the beaches during the Coronavirus outbreak. But now, Governor Ron DeSantis is weighing in on that dangerous situation.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So the message, I think, for spring breakers is that the party is over in Florida. You're not going to be able to congregate on any beach in the state. Many of the hot spots that people like to go to, whether it's Miami Beach, Fort Lauderdale, Clearwater Beach, are closed entirely for the time being.  The bars are closed. So you're not going to have a place to congregate there. So we would just tell those folks, you know, maybe come back next year when things are better.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: New CDC numbers show that 30 percent of U.S. Coronavirus cases impact young people. But these hard-partying kids either don't know about it or don't care about it. Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If I get Corona, I get Corona. At the end of the day, I'm not going to let it stop me from partying.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's really messing with my spring break. What is there to do here other than go to the bars or the beach? They're closing all of it. I think they're blowing it way out of proportion.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There are more serious things out there, like hunger and poverty.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I just turned 21 this year, so I'm here to party. So it's kind of disappointing. But we are just making the most of it.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: So Jesse, I go back to you, the young man on the panel. And I was thinking to myself, should Governor DeSantis have shut this down before these young people got there in the last two weeks?  WATTERS: Perhaps he was thinking that young people needed to get some fresh air, you know? Maybe the -- not the spring breakers that wanted to get out and get a little breeze and maybe that was healthy. But once they started inundating these beaches, he had to do what he had to do. And he made the right call. We're going to have two of these spring breakers that partied during the pandemic that you saw there on the clip on Watters World.  This weekend at 8:00, so check that out, but it's a messaging war. And I think in the beginning of that messaging war, a lot of the focus was on the elderly and the people with weak immune systems. And that gave a lot of young Americans the thought that, hey, I was immune to this thing. And I could slide by, but they didn't realize that they could then get it.  And infect older Americans, AKA the people that pay their tuition. So I think it's smart now that the taskforce is doing a lot of outreach. They're talking Barstool Sports. Dr. Fauci's doing a Facebook Live with Mark Zuckerberg. And it really is just getting educated about it.  WILLIAMS: So let's take a look at that. That was so interesting to me. Here's Barstool Sports, and here's Dr. Fauci talking to them like they're eight years old.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Speak to us like we're eight years old. How does something like this even start?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What would you say to young people out there that might be thinking like I'm young, I'm spry, I'm healthy.  ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: We need the young people to help us to protect the vulnerable because when an individual who's young gets infected and either has no symptoms at all, or even mild symptoms, that individual will continue the virus spreading in the community.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: So Dagen, when you're in New York City, I don't -- I think the bars are closed, the clubs are closed. What do you see from young people in an urban setting?  MCDOWELL: Well, they closed on because people wouldn't stop going to the restaurants and bars. And I'll add that idiocy and arrogance do not disappear when you start getting crow's feet, gray hair, and a pooch.  We're just not showing video of how many 30-something women are out in groups in this country last night going out. I'm getting married, I finally found a man, let's party. We're just hitting on -- we're just hammering these young people because they just happen to be in the bright sunshine.  WILLIAMS: Wow. Dana, what do you think? How was the New York City behavior?  PERINO: Well, pretty good. I mean, like there's -- I feel like there's nobody out. But again, I don't go out. I go home and I'm just trying to be very responsible. I thought that the Barstool Sports, having Dr. Fauci on, it was great for Barstool Sports. Thank you for having him on.  And Dr. Fauci, he's a national treasure. I think he should get the National Medal of Freedom when this is over. Dr. Birx probably as well because they are working -- they have worked nonstop for two months on this.  And the other thing I'm a little concerned about, though, is so Governor Desantis makes this decision, and now all of these young people are just going to go home. And then what? I mean -- and you can see those simulations as things spread, that's how it happens.  WILLIAMS: Yes. That's why I was curious about why he didn't do it earlier. But let's -- you know, I think he reacted to the aerial photos showing the beaches being crowded. So Greg, when you look at New York City, or you look at the beach, the question occurs to people well, what happens when people start to feel a little bit like cabin fever in a week or two, because the government saying this is going to take much longer than just two weeks?  GUTFELD: Well, I'm going to have to disagree with Dagen for the first time ever. Young people are stupid is a headline you could use in every single decade. Being a human is interesting. In order to get to adulthood, you have to survive your own stupidity as a teen because your brain isn't fully formed.  So you can run someone over in a car, you could get drunk or overdose and kill yourself. You can -- you can permanently alter your life by being a dumb teen. And the only thing that gets that teen into adulthood is something mysterious. It's called parents. Where the F are these parents?  These parents paid for their GED trips. These parents knew they were going there during this pandemic. The parents said, oh, be safe, and please don't drink too much, and don't get you know -- don't hook up. There's a -- there's a disease out there that's going to -- they're going to bring back and kill you and your parents.  So it's -- yes, kids are stupid, but we created a family structure so that the teenagers can make it to adulthood through the mentoring of parents. But when the parent abdicate that responsibility, you have spring break with a bunch of people who just see short term benefit, partying, and not the long term risks which is death. Teens favor short term benefit over long term risk. This is showing you this, and the parents should have stopped this and they didn't and they're losers.  WATTERS: Greg, I have to say something. I can't believe I'm saying this. You'd make a great father.  PERINO: You would.  WATTERS: It's not too late.  WILLIAMS: All right, up next, up next, President Trump calling out China after brand new information shows that country could have slowed the coronavirus outbreak globally by acting sooner. That's next on THE FIVE.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  MCDOWELL: What did China know and when did it know it? A new report shows the coronavirus outbreak could have been contained by 95 percent if the communist regime acted sooner. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pushing for answers saying if we do not figure out where China went wrong, we could face another crippling pandemic in the future. And President Trump addressed the cover-up earlier.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: Well, it would have been much better if we had known about this a number of months earlier. It could have been contained to that one area in China where it started. And certainly, the world is paying a big price for what they did.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  MCDOWELL: Jesse?  WATTERS: Well, the first case of coronavirus surfaced in mid-November. That's four months ago. And when the scientists identified the virus, the Chinese government told them to destroy the samples, and they gagged the scientists and told them to lie about it. Then they allowed these wet markets where the contamination started to remain open.  They told the WHO, World Health Organization that it was not contagious, human to human. They allowed the New Year's celebration and Wuhan, 11 million people to go on. Everybody drinking and eating and having a great time together. And that was a colossal mistake. Then they allowed thousands of Chinese citizens to fly all over the country. The Chinese government dragged its feet in releasing data to the rest of the world on this.  And when the Trump administration offered to send U.S. scientist to Wuhan to investigate and help, they said, no, you're not allowed. So now when they say, oh, the U.S. military, they were the ones that planted the virus in Wuhan, and they say we're going to withhold drugs from the United States during the pandemic, that's just crazy. And the fact that the President calls it the Chinese virus, he just wants to make sure that there's a little accountability and truth to what happened.  MCDOWELL: Juan?  WILLIAMS: Jesse, I think you're misreading the room. It's supposed to be a happy show today.  WATTERS: I'm talking about the Chinese government, Juan, covering things up.  WILLIAMS: Oh, I see. I see. We don't talk about -- we don't talk about us.  WATTERS: You seem to want to blame the President instead of the Chinese communist government, and that's where you're wrong.  WILLIAMS: I know who I elected, OK. So here's the thing.  WATTERS: Yes, you elected President Trump.  WILLIAMS: Yes, that's right. That's my president. That's what I say I speak about him.  WATTERS: Yes, he's our president, Juan, not the Chinese communist.  WILLIAMS: But I will say this. We have time -- we have time -- we're going to have time for after-action reports. I think it's inevitable. We're going to have a 9/11 commission style review of what happened. So we will be able to know exactly what happened and where this came from. I think it's so important. But I want to underline something that you said, which is something actually Senator Rubio and others have said, which is that we are so reliant on the Chinese.  Right now, we have I believe it's Governor Cuomo of New York over in China trying to look at them in terms of whether or not they have ventilators that they can sell us to help our hospitals. We are reliant on them in terms of our prescription drugs delivered in large part from China.  And so when they get vengeful or angry or whatever, you know, we have to somehow step in and say, you know what, this is too much. We can come back and make some of these things in the United States. Now, I understand it's going to be a higher cost.  MCDOWELL: Which is actually, Greg --  WATTERS: I agree, Juan. I agree.  MCDOWELL: Yes. And that's actually what President Trump's tried to do over the last three years is extricate ourselves from our reliance on China as a manufacturing hub. But Greg, what do you say?  GUTFELD: I, as a member of the media, I am absolutely disgusted, how we're saying these negative things about China. I mean, I just can't believe I mean, really, that's racist. This entire segment is racist, because we're pointing out the disease -- the disease's origins, and we shouldn't be ashamed of ourselves with dealing in facts. That's awful.  My suggestion I actually agree with Juan. Let's -- we need to turn our focus away from blaming people and make a list of the people who need to pay. And six months from now, we go back we look at the list, because right now, I want to get people well. I want to find the -- find the treatments and do all the good stuff. And you know what, screw the Chinese government. We'll deal with them later.  MCDOWELL: But Dana, I'll point out that the China, Jesse was mentioning, is waging a disinformation campaign on social media platforms that are created in the U.S. that their own citizens don't see, but we certainly do.  PERINO: That's why I actually think we have to -- I think we have to fight that part now. The after-action report on our actions and things, we can save that for later. But I would not rest on these propaganda pieces. We should try to get as much information in there as possible. Authoritarian regimes, that's how this kind of thing happens.  You had journalists there that were trying -- Chinese journalists, that were trying to raise the alarm. They're the ones that were put in jail. They're the ones who were rounded up. They're the ones who are now trying to use emojis and Morse code in order to get around the censors because they're worried about it.  I think we need a lot more of a push of social media into that country. We've got to talk to the younger people of China. Because the propaganda war, that is a serious one. And the only way to really deal with it is to have a lot of truth. And if we don't hold China accountable for this now, you know it's going to happen again, and it could be worse next time.  MCDOWELL: Indeed. More of THE FIVE next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: Welcome back. Time for the ""FASTEST SEVEN."" First up, Hollywood celebrities teaming up to make us all feel a little bit better by singing John Lennon's classic Imagine, but maybe making things worse or better. Listen at your own risk.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  GAL GADOT, ACTRESS: Imagine there's no heaven.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's easy if try.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No hell below us.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Above is only sky.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Imagine all the people --  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Living for today.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: See, I liked it all the way up to that point because she blocked me on Twitter. But that's -- you know, here's the thing. I can't rag on this Dana, because I'm telling people to do productive, constructive things with their free time, and that's what they did.  PERINO: Honestly, what would we do without social media in the time of corona crisis?  GUTFELD: Exactly.  PERINO: I mean, basically --  GUTFELD: How would I talk to my wife?  PERINO: -- corona crisis, not coronavirus, corona crisis. Did you hear that? I just coined a new term. So, I mentioned yesterday that when I walked home the other day, I didn't have -- I did not have to look both ways crossing the streets. There's nobody here.  So this morning when I walked to work, I was listening to Go Ahead and Break My Heart by Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani, there's no one -- I sang out loud. For the first time in my life in New York City, all along, nobody have videotaped me, nobody judged me, I just sang.  GUTFELD: Wow. You sang like --  PERINO: And I have the worst voice.  GUTFELD: You know, it's -- the other reason why you don't have to look both ways, Dana, is the cars usually go right over you.  PERINO: Yes, I mean, it's handy.  GUTFELD: Yes, it really is. You know, Jesse, people would expect you to bash these celebrities. But you know what? I bet you're not I bet you're going to say, you know what, good for them.  WATTERS: That's where you're wrong, Gutfeld. No, I'm kidding. I would say this. Their heart's in the right place, but I don't like the way they did it as much as I liked the way Arnold Schwarzenegger did it.  GUTFELD: Yes.  WATTERS: Arnold Schwarzenegger is sitting in a hot tub at his mansion with a cigar and his dog telling everybody to stay home and stay at a spring break. That's the way to do it. Make it an educational message, maybe not just singing and say it's all about me, even though, Greg, their heart's in the right place.  GUTFELD: Yes, you know, Juan, I have to applaud it even though I don't know at least 80 percent of the people there.  WILLIAMS: Right. I wasn't sure. I wish they kind of put up chyrons to tell me who's that singing. But I like it, and I tell you why. Because I think anything, anything to give us a little joy and fun and even if you don't like it, even a little humor, a reason to make fun of somebody, bring it on. We needed.  Humans are social animals. And at this point, when we're all kinds of, you know, distancing and isolating and sheltering in place, I think the internet and the web and all that, it's playing an important and new role for us as humans.  GUTFELD: Yes. Dagen. OK, this has been overwhelmingly positive and I'm going to have to change my mind and say it's a terrible video because I can't be around this positivity.  MCDOWELL: Yes, only if narcissism killed the virus. No, I'm going to say -- I'm going to say positive things about this because they all -- I do know who they all are because I never leave the house. I don't get out. I have no friends, too. They all sing better than I do. I would just pick a different song. Search and destroy --  PERINO: Yes, something a little --  MCDOWELL: No Search and Destroy the Stooges.  GUTFELD: There you go.  PERINO: I don't know that one.  GUTFELD: You know, you don't know the Search and Destroyed by --  MCDOWELL: I'm a street walking Cheeto with a heart full of napalm.  PERINO: I'm going to listen to it on my way home.  GUTFELD: Oh, you'll love it. Sing it out loud, Dana.  PERINO: OK.  GUTFELD: All right, oh, wow, we got a special one more thing up next with these little furry friends.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PERINO: Look, she's back and we will explain in a moment. It's time for ""ONE MORE THING."" Greg, explain.  GUTFELD: All right, let's do this. Yes, look at that. It's a live version. OK, Cats vs. Cancer is a charity nonprofit site that is run by volunteers to help people battling cancer. They have this thing called March Meowdness which cats compete and you can vote by going to catsvscancer.org to -- for the -- for your favorite feline and all money goes to cancer and --  PERINO: Yes. And this is the first round.  GUTFELD: Yes. So here we are. We have two cats. So the first one Danna has, this is her assistant Hamdas' cat. She doesn't get her coconut water but she does eat cheese and yogurt is what this cat. Sahar.  PERINO: She's Sahar which means desert. Oh, look at this thing.  GUTFELD: She likes to play with cats.  PERINO: We get our hair done at the same place.  GUTFELD: Apparently, Sahar is fair and balanced. I don't know what that means. All right, let's go to Pishi. Jesse?  WATTERS: I don't know the name of this cat I'm holding.  GUTFELD: This is -- this is Jackie Heinrich's cat. Her office is in between me and Jesse's. So that's kind of scares me about my vote. But --  WATTERS: What have you heard Jackie?  GUTFELD: Her name means Kitty in Farsi. Oh, and when Jackie cuts a lemon, he comes running because he thinks tuna is next. So we have to vote on which one is the better cat. I'm going to tell you right now that I was blackmailed by Dana's assistant who said that if I didn't vote for her cat, Dana wouldn't do my show Saturday night. So there's that.  PERINO: I'm also an emergency fill-in for your show. And I think I'm doing a very nice thing. And I think this cat -- look at how fluffy this cat is.  GUTFELD: All right, how do they vote?  WATTERS: I have not been bribed, so I'm open to it.  GUTFELD: OK. Do people vote for this online?  PERINO: Yes.  GUTFELD: All right, vote online.  PERINO: Just get in the Web site catsvscancer.org.  GUTFELD: Yes, beautiful cats, beautiful cats.  PERINO: All right.  GUTFELD: I'm voting for -- I'm voting for yours, Hamda.  PERINO: Hamda's cat, Hamda's win.  GUTFELD: Sorry, Jackie. You know how it gets on my show.  PERINO: OK, the contest is still going on. OK. Jesse, your next.  WATTERS: That means Jackie doesn't have to help protect your secrets anymore, Greg. See, here's everything. Be careful with your book. All right, remember how yesterday we showed you the video of those Italians playing racquetball outside of their quarantine department buildings. Well, Italians are very innovative. Look what they do with the espresso. Attach it to a little line. Hey, you want some espresso? Sure. Coming your way. There you go. People coming together.  PERINO: I love it.  WATTERS: Isn't that what this is all about?  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: I love them.  GUTFELD: Or people saying apart actually.  WATTERS: Right, apart together.  PERINO: I'll do this one quickly. So a lot of concerts have been canceled. You know that. And a number of country music stars have started putting their concerts online for you to see. So last night Levi Lowrey played for nearly an hour on Facebook. That the latest show he's put on this week. He's great. And superstar Brad Paisley is going live in just a few minutes at 6:00 p.m. Eastern. And he even gave people his phone number and you can call and have a request.  And then tomorrow, if you want to tune in, we were doing a Storytime with Dana. That's where you know, if you want to flatten the curve, and you've got little kids and you want to give them a little time with Dana for Storytime, that'll be tomorrow at 4:15. All right, Juan, you're next.  GUTFELD: All right. So here's no random act of kindness. Here's a coordinated effort and it's being launched by athletes and team owners to help out workers at arenas and stadiums that are now quiet because of the coronavirus pandemic. Every major league team is donating a million dollars to help stadium staff according to Commissioner Rob Manfred. And here I am, by the way, with Usher at two of my favorite stadiums, Nationals Park and Orioles Park.  Meanwhile, the NBA teams and its players are making similar donations to help out staff at their arenas. Milwaukee Bucks MVP Center Giannis Antetokounmpo is donating $100,000 to workers at Pfizer forum in Milwaukee. These guys are real good sports.  PERINO: Dagen, I'm sorry, earlier my -- the cat was covering my microphone. I had a really good ""ONE MORE THING."" But Dagen, you go next.  MCDOWELL: Thank you. I will be brief. This cat hates Jesse, by the way. Once we're off the air, he's going to eat Jesse. People on social media are encouraging everybody do decorate their homes with Christmas lights. There you go. Lift people's spirits.  PERINO: Yes, OK. Well, vote for Sahar. That's what I said. Set your DVRs.  Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

NEW YORK'S PLASTIC-BAG BAN FRUSTRATES MANY SHOPPERS That was in 2007. Now, a warning from me in 2014. Six years ago, in my book, ""Not Cool,"" on page 136, I warned readers of reusable shopping bags. One study linked them to a 46 percent increase in deaths from foodborne illnesses. They raise the risk by harboring viruses that can go from your bag to the food you share with your family. Reusable feed bags might have also killed millions of piglets seven years ago by spreading a novel swine virus. Other research among humans shows how viruses spread with similar bags, making people sick. So why is this important? As states ban plastic bags, you're supposed to rely on reusable bags. Which, in a time like this, ain't good. We're told to steer clear of contaminated surfaces, yet we carry one to stores, schools, and workplaces. And we put our food in it. Right now, it makes sense to postpone these bans.

43,FOX,"Critics claim the rich and famous are getting coronavirus tests faster than average Americans; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" March 18, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Hello, everyone. I am Juan Williams, along with Greg Gutfeld, Dana Perino, Jesse Watters, and Dagen McDowell. It is 5:00 in New York City, and this is THE FIVE.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: I view it as a sense -- in as a sense a wartime president. I mean, that's what we are fighting. I mean, it's a very tough situation. You have to do things. You have to close parts of an economy that six weeks ago where the best they've ever been.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: Donald Trump calling himself a wartime president as the Coronavirus pandemic continues to grip the nation and the world. The virus now in all 50 states with more than 7600 Americans infected and 115 dead, Wall Street taking another beating today, the DOW falling another 1300 points. Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, is warning that without action, the crisis could lead to an unemployment levels approaching 20 percent.  But the government is responding, the Senate just passing a $100 billion package stimulating the economy, and President Trump invoking the Defense Production Act, which allows companies to quickly ramp up production of medical supplies. Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: We have targets for certain pieces of equipment. We have targets for masks. The numbers of masks are incredible. We have ordered millions of them. But we need millions more. A thing like this has never been requested and it's never -- we've never had even think in terms of these numbers. We need respirators.  We need -- ventilators is a big thing, because it's a complex piece of equipment. So we have a lot of ventilators but we are going to be ordering more.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: President Trump also pushing for a stimulus plan that could send a check for up to $1,000 to every American.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: My messages to all Americans but to those Americans who are going through a lot. We love them. We are with them. And we will not let them down. We have to help everybody. It was nobody's fault. This happened. I mean, some people could say it was somebody's fault, actually. But it was nobody's fault. And certainly, none of these companies that all of a sudden had no passengers and planes and had no passengers on crew ships and all of the things that have happened.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: Dana, it's been a dramatic turn. The president is now calling himself a wartime president, taking this all very seriously. What is going on? And what's the potential, in your mind, the surgeon general -- I'll play you a sound in a second. The surgeon general saying 15 days might not even be sufficient.  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Do you want to play that now or?  WILLIAMS: OK, let's play it now.  PERINO: OK. Let's listen to him and I'll respond to that.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Fifteen days is likely not going to be enough to get us all the way through. But we really need to lean into it now so that we can bend the curve in the next 15 days. And at that point, we will reassess.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: So I think that what you see happening is -- on the wartime presidency stuff, some might argue, you know, it's been in wartime because we have a war on terror. We're fighting in Iraq, ISIS, Afghanistan. But this is different. Some of the tools that the federal government is going to deploy right now have not been used.  And one of them has to do with the fact that you would be able to do some of this because of a pandemic, specifically. These were -- one of those was a law that was put in place in the 1950. We've never had to use it. So a lot of this is different. And the federal government, I think, what you hear Jerome Powell, the surgeon general doing, is basically trying to set people's expectations.  Because this is all very new to us, we're only in day two or three of feeling, like, wow. This is -- I'm not saying that people didn't think it was serious before, but when you realize that it starts to sink in a little bit more that your way of life is different. You know, when I walked home last night, I didn't even have to look both ways before I crossed the street.  Mom, don't worry. I was being safe. But really at 6:15 at night in New York City, you start realize how stark the changes are. On day three of children being home from school and parents trying to work from home. Everybody, I think, is being super patient with each other. Everyone's trying to be kind. Everyone's trying to be good.  And we look to the federal government to do the things that they are doing, like passing the bill today, getting the checks to people. It might not be enough. And that is one of the things that I think that you're hearing them saying. And while it might not be the most reassuring thing, it is more realistic. And it gets people to set their expectations accordingly.  Save, plan, take care of neighbors, get charities in place, do whatever they can so that we can all work together to beat this.  WILLIAMS: Absolutely. Greg, you know, I was thinking today that -- I said it's a switch in tone from the president. But I think now the whole country now has a sense that this is a dramatic moment in our lives, like 9/11 or the like. The one thing I noticed and I wanted to ask you about it, was I see a difference in terms of Democrats versus Republicans who say this is a serious threat, more Democrats, less Republicans, why the partisanship?  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: I don't even understand that question. I don't see any partisanship. It's a stupid question. This feels like wartime.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: The point I'm trying to make is what the president is saying is that we are living in wartime. And this is -- there's a time -- if you want to assign blame, Juan, or divide us into Republicans and Democrats. You can do that in six months. Just put it off for a while, because criticizing people because of their differences right now during this black swan event. It's going to feel good, but it's not helping anybody.  WILLIAMS: I agree.  GUTFELD: Never before have so many people all around the world focused on one thing. And we're looking at worst-case scenarios with timeframes and death rates. They aren't factoring in this incredible fundamental change that society is undergoing and the fundamental efforts that people are putting in right now. We are going to crush this, and we are going to save millions of lives.  This is a point in humanity's great moment. It's a great moment in humanity to see what we are doing, which is why the psychology of this is so crucial. It is counterproductive to sit here and point fingers. These people feel this way and these people feel that way. That is an energy suck. We can start calling each other names later.  But for now, let's just leave that behind us and focus on the future and not the past.  WILLIAMS: Right. What I'm saying I think the president has made a pivot and he is treating it with great seriousness. But what we see in the numbers is the people who aren't treating it with great seriousness tend to be politically divided.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Let me address that, Juan. Let me address that, Juan. I want to talk to my niece, Reagan, who is home right now. She's going crazy in her apartment. She is not political, Juan. She is just a 23-year-old going stir crazy. I want her to stay home. Practice guitar. Go on YouTube and take classes. She's not political, Juan.  So it's not a political thing. If you want to do the political thing, you do it. If you want to be divisive, you do it. Not me.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: I'm not in that conversation.  (CROSSTALK) ] WILLIAMS: -- because I think that your point about -- is it your niece, Greg?  GUTFELD: Yeah.  WILLIAMS: Yeah. Your point about your niece is something that Dr. Deborah Birx spoke to today. I want you to give a listen to this thought.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There are concerning reports coming out of France and Italy about some young people getting seriously ill and very seriously ill in the ICUs. We think part of this maybe that people headed the early data coming out of China and coming out of South Korea that the elderly or those with pre-existing medical conditions were at particular risk.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: Jesse, this is a little different. Previously, we were being told young people, especially children, less likely to really contract this. Now, what Dr. Birx is saying is wait a second. We are getting reports that in fact even as the elderly shelter in place, young people are getting very sick.  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: And that's why we have to just get this thing over with as soon as possible. The president cannot do this step-by- step approach. He needs to just declare war on Coronavirus. Invoke his many acts and provisions and laws as humanly possible, and just beat the hell out of this thing. Call for a nationwide shutdown, two weeks, three weeks, however long it takes.  The whole country self quarantines. Only essential workers go out. You only have to go out if you go to the grocery store or to pick up something at the pharmacy. That's the only way you're going to beat this thing, because right now we're looking at a recession, could be a depression, because it's getting a lot worse. You have to mobilize the military.  Maybe they build MASH units outside of cities. You have to rally the country around make in America. Do that instead of relying on China. Doctors and hospitals, they need to be doing as much as possible. And the FED needs to step up even more. At this point, we heard Dr. Birx say that this is now infecting young people in Europe.  That means all these young people at spring break are putting everyone's life at risk. And to say that this is something we just need to focus on the elderly, that gives everybody that's young in this country the feeling, like, hey, I can do whatever I want. We are seeing now they are doing investigations into the lungs of young people that get this virus. And they are destroying their lungs.  Some young people that get the virus are going to need to be on oxygen tanks if they don't get it. So I think president just needs to say forget about the markets. We're going to have to go all in on this thing if we are going to come out on the other side, and the country will rally around that.  WILLIAMS: Yeah. That's inspiring. Dagen, I wanted to come to you on the news of the day coming out of -- off of Capitol Hill with the regard to the passage of this $100 billion stimulus plan by the Senate. But the president is now saying he may need even more. How do you understand the expense and how is it translating in terms of Wall Street?  DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: So in phase one and phase two, they've -- it's only about maybe 110 billion. We are talking about ultimately my back of the envelope calculation, trillions of dollars to rescue this country, individuals, and corporations. And I will break it down. So the total stimulus that they are talking about in phase three is north of $1 trillion.  You've essentially shutdown a modern economy or large parts of it overnight. And you need to quickly make individuals who have no income solvent and liquid. So they have money to pay their bills, pay their utilities, pay their rent, buy food. And then you need to have corporations that are solvent and liquid. And you're going to have bailouts that make 2008 and 2009 look like picking strawberries on a Saturday.  That's what we are talking about. Because Jesse brought this up, if you don't act with speed and scale, to borrow words from the Wall Street Journal. You're going to turn a deep recession into something -- a long- lasting financial crisis that will look like the Great Depression. So for Steve Mnuchin to throw out 20 percent unemployment -- there's a forecast from JPMorgan out, saying that the second quarter economy in this country is going to contract 14 percent.  So that is Great Depression levels. If you don't start literally sending checks to people, we are not talking about $1,000. We're talking about $2,000. Send it to the people who need it who are out of work. Don't send it to me. I've got a job. I am sitting here in front of a TV camera. And they are going to have to rescue industry after industry.  That's where the political fight is going to get ugly, because they're going to require restrictions on how these companies operate. Airlines, we're talking about $50 billion in loans for the airlines. You're going to talk about leisure and hospitality, retailers, you name it. It is going to be bailouts from coast-to-coast. But this is what saves us from something catastrophic.  WILLIAMS: So Dana, when you hear about this, again, coming back to the politics of it. And Dagen says, you know, bailouts for certain industries. And then we come to this idea in this next wave that the president is calling for potentially sending checks to individuals, especially, as Dagen said, those who may have lost the job or, you know --  PERINO: We have to.  WILLIAMS: -- not only lose a job but maybe they've lost their business. So the question becomes, you know, do you think this is realistic? Do you think the American people would support it?  PERINO: I think they are not going to have a choice. I think that -- look, I think people come together and they do the right thing. And this is a little bit different to me. Like, if you think back to 2008 -- and to Dagen's point, I mean that fight was horrendous. I was at there at the White House at the time and you everybody fighting.  Everybody's mad because you're bailing out Wall Street, understood. Nobody wants to bail out Wall Street, but the banks were insolvent. Right now, the banks are OK. It's actually people who need help. This is actually the man on the street, the man on the farm, the man in the small town. All of these people are going to need help.  And I would just for doing something really big and also really fast, and showing that the federal government is going to be the backstop, because we will get through. And we will be stronger on the other side about -- but in the meantime, when you have to help people. I don't think it will be a problem getting these bills through.  It's going to hurt to look at the deficit numbers. That's going to be something we will have to commit to and figure out. But saving people's day-to-day lives -- if we're going to do all of this for the health of people, then of course we have to do everything to help for their economic health on the other side.  WILLIAMS: Weren't we making fun of this, though, when Andrew Yang suggested something like it with socialism?  PERINO: No.  WILLIAMS: When he was saying send $1,000 to --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: There are people who think that universal based income is actually a pretty good idea. I don't think of it as necessarily socialism, especially if you look at that -- in Alaska, how they give back money. But there will be plenty of time to figure it out. But to Dagen's point, $1,000 for people who really -- they're going to need more than that.  WILLIAMS: I agree. Greg?  GUTFELD: All right, to the monologue. We look at small things as trivial, but in reality, the things we ignore come back to haunt us. Look at me. I was once a small thing myself, still am. Another example, a scientific paper predicted that the presence of SARS-like viruses in bats, together with the practice of eating them, is a time bomb.  That warning was from 2007, now a warning from me, 2014, six years in my book, Not Cool, on page 136, I warned readers that reusable shopping bags that one study linked them to a 46 percent increase in deaths from food- borne illnesses. They raise the risk by harboring viruses that could go from your bag to the food you share with your family.  Reusable feed bags might have also killed millions of piglets seven years ago by spreading a novel swine virus. Other research among humans shows how viruses spread with similar bags, making people sick. So why is this important? As states ban plastic bags, you're supposed to rely on reusables, which in a time like this ain't good.  We're told to steer clear of contaminated surfaces, yet we carry one to stores, schools, workplaces, and put our food in it. Right now, it makes sense to postpone these bans. Hell, we are postponing everything else. It's a vector we can easily control. So here's the good news. We aren't running out of food, and we probably won't.  The bad news, those bags you put that food in aren't helping. Some viruses spread through good intentions gone bad. The best intention now is to ask for single-use bags, plastic, or paper. So Dana, my wife comes home. She's got the mask on because we role-play.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: She is very healthy, very healthy, does all the hand washing, yells at me to take my shoes off. But she's holding the damn bags, the reusable bags with produce in them.  PERINO: Yeah.  GUTFELD: I think we think that this is a good move, but it's not.  PERINO: Because we are -- I mean -- there is concern about plastics in the ocean, right? That is a concern. Plastic in the -- is a concern. But your book pointed it out, John Tierney, City Journal's been pointing out for years, Kim Strassel, the Wall Street Journal, so I always think about this. I don't like -- I get plastic anxiety as well.  It's like with water bottles and things like that. But this point about the bags and carrying things around and everything, it -- we know that it causes more problems. And so rethinking some of these things, it's not too late. Its -- you can do this. You can turn back things right away. The president has already shown this.  One of the things they did in the last two days, they stopped -- ended regulations that didn't make sense in the first place, which was now doctors can work across state lines.  GUTFELD: Yeah.  PERINO: And how about telemedicine, right? There were regulations against some of that. And they -- by getting government to get out of the way, you allow more competition. And my hope is that there will be some super smart people out there, maybe like Reagan who is there on the couch, you know, learning guitar. Maybe she will have this amazing innovative idea to come up with a product and the solution that will help us have more biodegradable plastics. That would be ideal.  GUTFELD: Yeah. So Jesse, the problem is that we have to rely and people like me to wash my bags. Sometimes, I wear the same gym shirt three days in a row. I just dry it out on the shower, Dana. So I'm going to do that. People grabbed their bag and they just go to the place. And that's the problem, because you have to wash this bag every day, which is worse for the environment because of the chemicals you're using. I read somewhere.  WATTERS: I want to say something funny about your role play comment. I'm not going to say it. I think it's just smarter if I just bite my tongue on that one.  PERINO: You can't hold my hand.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: I'm social distancing myself from gaffes. Listen, like you said at the top, you have good intentions and then sometimes it backfires. Remember, they said you don't want to clear the underbrush out of these forests because it's bad. Well, then you have wildfires. Or they say, you know, raise the minimum wage in New York City, and then they fire half the waitresses.  So sometimes these things go the wrong way. I used to make fun of people, like germaphobes. Jerry Seinfeld, how many episodes on Seinfeld did they make fun of his fear of germs? I mean, Kramer installing the garbage disposal in the shower and makes Jerry a salad, or Elaine sneezes on the pasta primavera and gets the NBC executive sick.  Or Jerry catches the chef not washing his hands when he comes out of the bathroom. These are things that you're saying that's funny. But now you look back and you say Jerry was right this whole time. We just need to re- evaluate everything that we've been doing. And after we beat this thing, we are going to look back and say.  Do we need to start having more people work remotely? Why are we living on top of each other in these cities? The handshake, is the handshake an outmoded concept in this country? We are overly reliant on China. The borders are wide open. All of these things are going to have to be re- evaluated one at a time.  GUTFELD: Dagen, should they delay the ban?  MCDOWELL: Yeah. We shouldn't have the ban in the first place. It goes to your point. Who is making these decisions about banning plastic bags? You know it's some guy in a room going let's stick it to the oil and the chemical companies. It's not based on any research. As you pointed out, it goes back more than a decade knowing that these bags aren't sanitary.  I banned the handshake a while ago, just to tell you, because about 1 out of every 20 dudes who shake your hand want to do that weird little tickle thing, which is just creepy. And that, Greg, leave with you two words, Darth Vader.  GUTFELD: Very good. So Juan, I think the good news is the problem here isn't food. We're -- I think we are going to do OK in this industry. It is the bag. How do you feel? Should it be banned -- should the ban be temporarily suspended?  WILLIAMS: Yeah. I mean, if you can identify it as a source of spreading the virus, I would. I think that what you said there in describing it to the audience is that if often gets dirty, filled up with microbes. You don't know what's in it. You said that it killed piglets one, right? So I think that's very real.  Now, I do think it's not a reason to say let's give up on this idea, because, you know -- look, I think you can look up in the trees in Central Park or any part in this country and you see plastic bags, and you know about the oceans. So I think coming up with biodegradable substances that could make that bag is a good idea.  I just don't want us to use this as an opportunity to go back on lots of our efforts in terms of making sure that the environment, the fact that we see, you know, climates rising. You know, we just can't give up. I think we got to stay focused on what we are already doing, make it better. Don't allow that to somehow communicate this terrible disease.  Today, I was shocked. I'm telling you the truth. I was shocked that said 475 people died in one day today in Italy. I just -- it's hard to believe. This is what we are going through as a world right now.  GUTFELD: Exactly. Well, coming up, Biden courting Bernie bros after more primary victories last night, but can he win them over, that and more, next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PERINO: Bernie Sanders is assessing his campaign after Joe Biden had another big night, winning primaries in Florida, Arizona, and Illinois. Biden is now courting Sanders' supporters. But there are questions over if they will end up getting behind the former VP, but here is Joe Biden last night.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Let me say especially to the young voters who have been inspired by Senator Sanders. I hear you. I know what's at stake. I know what we have to do. Our goal as a campaign and my goal as a candidate for president is to unify this party, and then to unify the nation. You know, it's a moment like these we realize we need to put politics aside and work together as Americans.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: President Trump weighed in by mocking Sanders on Twitter, saying that he has, quote, ""given up just like last time."" There were rumors today, Greg that Bernie Sanders was going to get out. Now, last week, there was another rumor. I made a bet that he was getting out. I lost. I've been off of Twitter for a week until about an hour ago.  I didn't miss it that much. But shouldn't Bernie get out at this point? I mean, there is no way he can win. It's mathematically impossible.  GUTFELD: I am just disgusted that you are gambling at a time like this.  PERINO: Why? Gambling just -- we should all be gambling.  GUTFELD: We're gambling. Bernie is intent on making his mark by pulling Joe so far left that by November, he will be wearing a Che Guevara shirt and quoting from the Communist Manifesto. I think that's what -- Bernie's agenda is being -- is like software being put into Joe Biden right now. That's what's happening. But I will say this.  The whole story feels like something that's on another channel during the Super Bowl. It's like right now, the Corona Super Bowl is on all the time, and the primary was like a rerun of Facts of Life on TV land, and Bernie is Mrs. Garrett.  PERINO: Oh, think about that. I mean, Mrs. Garrett was kind of cool.  GUTFELD: Yeah. That's what I'm saying.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Bernie is got some -- he's on the ball. I wouldn't say that about Joe.  PERINO: Dagen, what do the betting markets say about Bernie Sanders -- I'm just looking for a gambling reference here. What do you wager on Bernie Sanders staying in?  MCDOWELL: Oh, nothing. I -- he's got to get out. To quote BB King, ""the thrill is gone. The thrill is gone, baby."" He's got no more rallies to go to. There are no more screaming fans. The young people who showed up for him didn't actually go out and vote. And we learn from Florida where Joe Biden won every single county that older folks have really good memories about communist Cuba.  And they actually go out and vote their heart and their head, because that's exactly what happened. Bernie Sanders' team, this is according to Biden's camp, ran more than 4600 ads on TV in Florida attacking Joe Biden on social security. Well, older people know that communism's bad, and that Medicare for All actually gets rid of Medicare as we know it.  PERINO: That's a really good point. Juan, how are these candidates going to start campaigning? The president, he is managing a crisis, so he's going to be on air everyday. He might tweet about politics. But, like, for something like a Biden, even a Bernie, like, how do you continue to campaign? You're going to have to come up with some different ways.  WILLIAMS: Well, actually Bernie was back in Washington today in the Senate, saying that he's focused on the virus and trying to get the government to respond effectively in supporting the passage of the bill Dagen and I talked about a moment ago to inject more money into the economy. But I think from the Biden perspective, it's doing what we saw earlier.  He stands up and he gives a speech and says here's what I think we should be doing, how we should be coming together as an American people to address this problem. And at the same time, he's reaching out to Bernie Sanders' supporters I think the literal quote, Dana, is ""I hear you."" I hear what you've been saying in terms of your support for Senate for Senator Sanders and making the case that he wants them and he wants their votes and he's willing to work for their votes.  So I think you're going to see much more of that, much more people coming from their living rooms if necessary. We've got a little bit of a hiatus here, three weeks before the next set of primaries. But after yesterday, with Biden sweeping so clearly, sweeping in Illinois, Arizona, and Florida, I just don't think that there's much have a realistic chance, realistic chance that Sanders catches up, absent some catastrophic event. And at the moment, we're living through a catastrophic event.  PERINO: Right. So, Jessie, your thoughts Sanders not happening?  WATTERS: Well, I think he'll take it to the convention because that's who he is. I just -- Joe is like reaching his hand out and the Bernie bros are just smacking it away. At this point in the game, I don't understand the never Biden movement.  If you're a Bernie supporter, and Biden gets the nomination and it's Election Day, you have a choice. It's between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. How do you not as a Bernie supporter, just vote for Joe Biden? Like if Joe Biden becomes president, you can pull Joe to the left. If Donald Trump is reelected, you can't pull Donald Trump to the left.  So the only thing I can think of is one of two reasons. One, they want Joe Biden to lose because they want to say I told you so. You can't run an establishment candidate. You got to run a socialist. Or they honestly think that they could never bring themselves to vote for anybody other than a socialist because they're just too pure ideologically. But you know, at the end of the day, it's not my problem. It's the Democrat's problem.  PERINO: It's not your problem, indeed. OK, coming up. Celebrities and athletes catching heat for quickly getting tested for the coronavirus while other Americans have to wait.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WATTERS: Coronavirus testing is ramping up, but many Americans are still having a hard time getting checked out. That's not the case for big-time celebrities and athletes who have had no problem cutting the testing line. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo getting grilled after members of the NBA's Brooklyn Nets got tested ahead of mostly all other patients. Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JAKE TAPPER, ANCHOR, CNN: How are all these multimillionaire professional athletes getting access to these tests and getting results so quickly? I mean, I know that we have a healthcare system where those with means enjoy much better care than those without, but this seems really obscene.  GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): Jake, if you -- if you fit the protocol, you can get a test. You don't want to fit the protocol, fever, been to a country that had an outbreak, been in the company of someone who tested positive. If you fit the protocol, you can get the test.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: And actress Vanessa Hudgens is being called out for complaining about the postponement of the Coachella Music Festival.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  VANESSA HUDGENS, ACTRESS: Yes, until July sounds like a bunch of (BLEEP). I'm sorry. But like, it's a virus. I get it. Like, I respect it. But at the same time, like, even if everybody gets it, like, yes, people are going to die. Just terrible, but like, inevitable.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: OK, Juan, you know, I want to get to Vanessa in a second. I'm going to leave her for Greg.  GUTFELD: Thank you.  WATTERS: I want to ask you that the NBA situation because in a way, I totally understand it. If you're an NBA owner and you have, you know, $30 million over three years locked into a player's contract, and he has the flu, and you know -- and he's been in contact with maybe one of the other players that tested positive, I'm going to move heaven and earth to get this guy test because he's a big investment.  WILLIAMS: Yes, I'm not sure that's the logic. I'm curious to hear you say that.  WATTERS: Oh, that's the logic, Juan.  WILLIAMS: Oh, you think -- you see, I think the -- I think the reason, for example, the state of Oklahoma used half of its daily allotment of tests on the whole Oklahoma City Thunder is because they want to know exactly where the focus is once they identify that one person on that team has the virus, because then they're looking to kind of restrict those people and follow them and figure out how they can control the spread.  If it's what you said, boy, that is just, you know, to me all about money craving in the worst. And, you know, it's ironic. I think it was Alexandria Ocasio-Cortes saying, you know, rich is better in American society, especially with health care. But I just hope people wouldn't be that silly.  If we didn't have a shortage of the test. I'll say this to you, Jesse, then there wouldn't be this premium in terms of the rich and famous having access to the test.  WATTERS: Yes, that is true. That's another story for another day, Dana. I mean, they did this on the Today Show. There was a producer who tested positive and you know, he or she wasn't feeling well, and she's working in close contact with all the today show hosts who have to deliver the news about an international pandemic every day to millions of Americans. You definitely -- and are getting paid millions of dollars, you do have to strategically tests.  PERINO: Part of it is just -- is just reality, right? So if you -- let's find -- let's say that somewhere along the way, someone in my family were to get cancer. Would I do everything I could -- would I call Dr. Nicole Saphier and say, who's the best doctor that you know, and could you possibly call them for me. Like, I would do that because I want to do something for my family.  And I can't say that that's fair or unfair. I wouldn't want to knock somebody else out, but everybody is trying to do the best for their people, whether it's what you're saying in terms of the owners wanting to make sure. I don't really get -- I don't think what -- Juan, I don't think what you're saying is accurate. If you're doing the Thunder, like -- I mean, I love the Oklahoma thunder, believe me, but I don't know if that's going to tell you exactly where to focus in Oklahoma. There's going to be bigger problems. But I also just think that it's reality.  The good news, there are improvements in testing. There are tests now coming in all over, plus there could be an innovation where there is a test where you can do it yourself. And that would alert you to whether you have the virus and you would know whether to self-quarantine or to stay away from others that were vulnerable. So scientific innovation, private sector innovation that's going to help solve this and bring the cost down.  WATTERS: Right. And Dagen, it is true that when people that aren't feeling well-read about an NBA player making $10 million a year getting tested like that, you know, that's not going to make the average American feel very safe and protected.  MCDOWELL: I understand athletes in general needing to get tested because their bodies, that is their livelihood. Like I've got fat knees and still can do my job. It has nothing -- it has nothing to do with it. So I kind of understand that. And to your point, it's in the owners interest.  But in terms of these Instagram influencers getting tested, this one who used her connections here in New York City to get a test, I understand flying on a private jet, going to a beach hut to party, wearing a lot of loaner jewelry and taking photographs of it, but this is next level horse manure.  WATTERS: Greg Coachella, it's on the chopping block. Are you freaking out, man?  GUTFELD: Well, first of all, remember that on THE FIVE, we were the first to talk about the NBA players. I asked Dr. Siegel about it. He didn't -- he says I can't even get the test. Remember he said that, or did I dream that? Yes, it was last week. It was Friday.  Anyway, OK, I'm going to defend Vanessa Hudgens because I'm going to defend every single person who is getting slammed for saying silly, or light, or mistaken comments in this fog of war, right? Because there's a lot of -- there's this -- there's this little sport going on among the press, slamming people for being human, for not assessing the situation when they should have assessed it. Because everybody is looking at this differently and trying to figure out a way to deal with it in their own heads.  You know, we slammed Generation Z at spring break, even though I know that if I was 20, I probably would have been there too. I got to explain to again, my niece after the show why she can't go outside because he's driving her parents crazy. My point is that everybody is dealing with this in specific ways, and they're all coming together at a different pace.  WATTERS: Right.  GUTFELD: And yet, what we're doing is we're saying, you didn't do it fast enough.  WATTERS: Right.  GUTFELD: You didn't -- and what's weird is that if you had gone overboard, you would have been slammed for that. It was in January when I call for the travel ban, and I got crap for that. And yet, I think that I might have overdone it. I'm thinking like, I'm like the stock market, I'm up and I'm down, I'm up and I'm down, because the stock market reflects all of our psyches.  And I think we just got to lay off, let people figure this stuff out, but come together and support people who are doing the productive things.  WATTERS: Yes. You know, not to make this about me, but I'm going to make this about me for a second. You know, the other day on the show, I said that I went out to dinner this past weekend and I realized that was the wrong thing to do. And I just got murdered on the internet by these people in the media. But I see these people in the media on social media talking about where they went out to dinner, and on Instagram posting pictures of them at dinner, so we get it.  MCDOWELL: They're the shame police.  WATTERS: We all get it past. All right, the ""FASTEST SEVEN"" up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  MCDOWELL: Time for the ""FASTEST SEVEN"" Coronavirus Edition. First up, this outbreak is the biggest story in the world, but believe it or not, some people still had not heard of it. After Jared Leto missed the news while on a 12-day meditation retreat without his phone and the cast of Big Brother Germany had to be told by host on a recent episode. Greg, you and Jared Leto like this?  GUTFELD: Oh yes, we talk every day. Talking about ruining your entire meditation retreat, all that peace and de-stressing, it's just a race when you come home and you're just like, oh my God, everything is screwed. Meditation didn't prepare me for this.  MCDOWELL: Dana?  PERINO: Well, I was kind of surprised. I didn't -- I don't watch Big Brother so I didn't know that there was like a news blackout that they couldn't be told things. But it does seem to me that there's an ethical question there where if you want to make sure that you're protecting yourself or others or your or your family members, that I think that it would have been the right thing to tell them.  MCDOWELL: Juan, do you watch it?  WILLIAMS: No, I never have.  MCDOWELL: Germany.  WILLIAMS: I guess not. You know, this reminds me though of that famous saying when Dorothy gets the Oz and she says to her dog Toto, I don't think we're in Kansas anymore. So you come back and this is like literally a reality check. Like oh my God, this is what -- this is the world today? The guy would just tell them, don't get on the internet and start buying toothpaste or any of these miracle cures. There's a lot of nonsense out there.  GUTFELD: Well, buy toothpaste.  WILLIAMS: Not that toothpaste.  MCDOWELL: Jesse?  WATTERS: Is Big Brother Germany -- are those like Americans that are participating in Big Brother in Germany or are those Germans?  PERINO: German.  WATTERS: OK, so it's Germans, the German edition of Big Brother?  GUTFELD: Yes. Where are you going, Jesse?  WATTERS: No, that's all. I mean, it just seems strange like that's a kind of a strange knockoff.  PERINO: It's not a knockoff.  WATTERS: It is a knockoff.  PERINO: No, it's actually same franchise.  GUTFELD: It started in the Netherlands, I believe, right?  WATTERS: Big Brother, Netherlands?  GUTFELD: Yes. No, it's Endemol is the creator, I think.  PERINO: I have no idea.  MCDOWELL: I'm so glad you know that.  WATTERS: I got a lot of questions about this.  GUTFELD: German Big Brother, they're all wearing leather.  PERINO: But not --  WATTERS: And they definitely have coronavirus there.  MCDOWELL: Roleplaying. Up next, running out of toilet paper might feel like an emergency right now, but do not call the cops about it. An Oregon police department is begging folks to stop dialing 911 when they're out of T.P.  PERINO: I think that they should publish their names in the newspaper if they do that. They'll never do it again.  GUTFELD: Have you ever -- come on, Dana, have you ever tried to call somebody when you ran out of toilet paper? Everybody has done that.  PERINO: No. I have never -- I have never run out of toilet paper.  GUTFELD: Oh, well, aren't you special?  PERINO: I plan ahead.  WATTERS: Peter, can you bring me a roll?  PERINO: I have done that. I have done that.  GUTFELD: That's my point.  PERINO: I don't call 911.  GUTFELD: Well, you might live alone in the woods. You need somebody to come bring --  PERINO: You live alone in the woods, and don't worry about toilet paper.  GUTFELD: That's disgusting.  PERINO: Well, I actually called somebody about that a few days ago. And they said -- they described how to make a homemade bidet which I'll say for another time. Juan?  WILLIAMS: Yes. Well, I think if you're in the woods, you could call Yogi Bear.  GUTFELD: That's true.  WILLIAMS: Maybe he would help you out. But I mean, people, what a waste of energy and time. I mean, it's like people calling the police because you know something's gone off in the street or something. I mean, the police had better things to do. It's unbelievable that people would make that call to me. It's just crazy.  WATTERS: Yes, Juan, you know who made the call?  WILLIAMS: Who?  WATTERS: Jared Leto?  WILLIAMS: That makes sense.  PERINO: On the meditation retreat.  WATTERS: Yes, he ran out.  MCDOWELL: All right, ""ONE MORE THING"" next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WILLIAMS: It's time now for ""ONE MORE THING."" Dana Perino.  PERINO: Well, animals are great live edition. OK, so you know, there's not a lot of sports to watch right now because everything got canceled. Well, there is something you can do. It's called March Meowdness, as part of the Cats Versus Cancer Charity. Every day, there's a head to head matchup where you vote for your favorite cat until one is called the winner.  Cats Versus Cancer is a nonprofit. And volunteers, they organize the whole thing. It's very fun and interactive. Now, this is Sahar. This is my assistant's cat. Hamdah Salhut, this is her cat, Sahar. She's in this year's first bracket. So if you check out the site, be sure to give this perfect kitty that was written for me. Your vote on Instagram, it's Sahar the Cat. And she's very beautiful, very, very beautiful.  I also just wanted to mention that Fox is doing something really cool. Fox News is offering free access to national and local news to all viewers. So you can stay informed with the latest updates on everything at foxnews.com, the Fox News app, and fox.com. All of that is going to be free for viewers if you want to check it out. And don't forget to vote for Sahar.  WATTERS: Wait, Dana did the cats fight each other? How do you gamble on the cat?  PERINO: It's just by pictures? They have to play poster picture.  WATTERS: Who's cuter?  PERINO: Yes. You know, like the cat-off. It's kind of like Greg's Cat-Off.  GUTFELD: You know, I finally figured out what to do when you run out of toilet paper.  PERINO: Get a cat?  GUTFELD: That's a fluffy cat.  PERINO: Hey, Sahar, look at the camera there, baby.  WILLIAMS: I think Jasper is jealous. I'll tell you that.  PERINO: Well, I better change this sweater before I get home.  WILLIAMS: All right, OK, so it's my turn. I'm going to pick up on what Danny was talking about because due to coronavirus, the sports world has gone to the dogs. I'm not kidding. Take a look at this. That's the winner of the Iditarod in Alaska. The winner of the race was Thomas Werner of Norway.  Now, I didn't get to watch the race. That's not how I know about it. I know about it because New York Post sportswriter Mike Vaccaro wrote that with basketball, baseball, and even the NASCAR races off of T.V. due to the coronavirus. The only thing left for him to watch was the dog race, so he streamed it.  And Mike Vaccaro said he had a great time doing it. But even with that, he had to say that the post-race celebration in Nome, Alaska had to be called off because of the virus. It's still time to give a big hug. And a big, big round of applause to the winning dogs in this year's dog race. All right, Greg, you're up.  GUTFELD: I did a rod once.  PERINO: Oh my gosh.  GUTFELD: I love these people. All right, so I did this a long time ago. I'm doing it now, instead of I hate these people. I got three groups. Number one, I'm going to mention Peloton because exercise is the most important thing you can do right now, in my mind, to keep yourself sane. You don't have to do peloton. They're just really good right now. When I'm home alone on the bike, I know all the trainers. But bike, if you can get a used indoor cycle or any kind of equipment, it's going to get you through these long, hard periods.  My second person I love, of course, Scott Adams. You got to wake up every morning at 10:00 a.m. -- at 10:00 a.m. Go to his Twitter feed. He does a live Periscope and he has the most optimistic research and information on the coronavirus. It's a good way to start your day.  And finally, all the workers at Fox News who are walking around cleaning the door handles, and the desks, and the keyboard, they are nonstop cleaning everything. And that's an important thing because every time they're doing it, they're killing vectors. So I love these people.  PERINO: Yes, we love those people.  WILLIAMS: And we love Jesse. Jesse, your turn.  WATTERS: The feeling is mutual, one. All right, so it gets a little boring during the quarantine especially in Italy, so you got to do something for fun. Check out these two guys, you know, playing a little paddle out the window, keeping a safe six-feet distance from each other.  PERINO: Oh my god. They're very good.  WATTERS: There it goes.  PERINO: Darn it.  WATTERS: They're pretty good.  WILLIAMS: All right, Dagen, bring us home.  MCDOWELL: I have some more coronavirus upbeat news. One young woman refused to let social distancing get in the way of sharing some news with her granddad. Carly Boyd stood outside the window of his nursing home and held up her hand after she got engaged. The nursing home was in on the surprise, raise the blinds.  Boyd said her granddad was so happy, he kept asking when is the wedding. My granddad, may he rest in peace, would have gone, he's a bomb.  WILLIAMS: I love that story though. I love these people reaching out to the elderly. Set your DVRs, never miss an episode of THE FIVE. ""SPECIAL REPORT"", that great show is up next.  Hey, Bret Baier.

44,FOX,"Communities stepping up amid coronavirus pandemic. As we realize we're in the coronavirus crisis together, people are stepping up to help each other. For example, a college student launched a shopping program for at-risk people in Nevada. Others have done similar things all over, including one young woman. ""It has a very large elderly community here and I was just really worried that those people, those neighbors weren't getting what they needed,"" the young woman said in an interview. ""We also got another email late last night from a mom with a newborn in Brooklyn whose husband is sick, so we are setting up to get some stuff to her this morning, too. I had so many people reach out, both in the neighborhood to volunteer, but then also all over the world sending me pictures of their signs that they’re making, which I think is so huge."" ELECTIVE OPERATIONS CANCELED FOR THREE MONTHS IN ENGLAND AMID CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC So shouldn't doing good things be a competitive sport, since all the other ones are canceled?  A virtue-signaling Olympics, with real virtue? Not the kind of phony virtue on social media where a pop star tweets an inspirational phrase she Googled a minute ago. That’s zero cost with zero benefit. By the way, it's odd how our most famous celebrity crusaders have gone silent. My guess? They’re in guarded seclusion.

Granted, it's hard in isolation, but small things matter. Even washing your hands should make you feel heroic because you're killing germs! And sharing. Even sharing your toilet paper. One guy actually started a toilet paper exchange on a California street corner. His homemade sign said, ""Share your toilet paper."" It's working. Why? Because good deeds make you feel less crappy. It's not virtue signaling. It's virtue doing. We saw idiots hoarding toilet paper, and true to their memetic nature, people copied it.

45,FOX,"White House unveils $850 billion spending package; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" March 17, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  WATTERS: Hello, everybody. I'm Jesse Watters, along with Juan Williams, Dana Perino, Greg Gutfeld, and Dr. Nicole Saphier. It is 5:00 in New York City, and this is THE FIVE. America is at war against an invisible enemy, and we will win. That's the urgent message coming from President Trump amid the rapidly developing Coronavirus pandemic.  There are a lot of new developments, almost 6,000 Americans testing positive, and over 90 people here have died. Cases are now being reported in every state except West Virginia and millions more across the country being impacted by businesses and schools shutting down. President Trump meeting with business leaders today as Washington prepares for a historic response to blunt the economic impact the virus is causing.  The White House pushing Congress to pass an $850 billion stimulus package, including putting money in American's hands.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: Were giving relief to affected industries and small businesses, and we're ensuring that we emerge from this challenge with a prosperous and grown economy because that's what's going to happen. It's going to pop. We are going to do something that gets money to them as quickly as possible.  It's a substantial number. We're going big. The expression we could do it two ways. We could keep going back every day or every week. We are going big. The best thing we can do is get rid of the virus. Once that's gone, it's going to pop back like nobody's ever seen. One day, we will be standing possibly up here. We'll say, well, we won and we're going to say that.  As sure is you're sitting there, we're going to say that. And we are going to win. And I think we're going to win faster than people think.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: The president also warning Americans to take precautions, but is also saying the country will get through this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: We are asking everyone to work at home if possible, postpone unnecessary travel, and limit social gatherings to no more than 10 people. We're stepping it up as much as we can. And the testing procedures are going well. We are looking to save the maximum number of lives. Everything else is going to come back. A life is never going to come back.  We have to get rid of this. We have to win this war, and ideally quickly, quickly. Because the longer it takes, it's not a good situation. But if people do what we're telling them to do, what we're asking them to do, you're going to see the saving of a lot of lives. All of a sudden, we're going to wow. That's looking good. That's looking good. That's looking good.  And we're going to be on the other side of the curve, and that's the day that we look forward to.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: OK. So Dana Perino, who is just below me in the studio, hi, Dana, how are you? What do you think about the president's tone today? He's getting a lot of accolades for the full frontal assault on this virus. And I think bringing all hands on deck with regards to a stimulus package and warning Americans, really, take precautions, stay at home as much as possible.  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: I would rate it nothing short of excellent, because I think yesterday you saw the tone change and you saw them -- that he spent a lot of time yesterday and today, a lot of time, answering as many questions, exhausting the questions in the room, being as transparent as possible.  And I think that everybody -- that team seems to me to be working very well together. And then you add that -- so many things happening at once. You have the healthcare issues, so that's where you have Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci and their teams working on that piece. Then you have the economic piece, which -- I am pretty calm in a crisis usually.  This one, I feel myself sometimes like not breathing, and not because I'm necessarily worried about the healthcare issues because there's nothing I can do about that. But I am worried for the workers across America who are really going to be hit hard. And I absolutely agree with the administration to go with a super big package.  Do it once. Have a Congress do it together. And we will have to figure out on the other end how we deal with that. I remember in 2008 during the financial crisis, it was very unpopular to spend all that money especially to bail out Wall Street. This is very different. The banks were able to pay that money back. We have a situation right now where it's so important for us to figure out a way to help keep employees as connected to their employers as possible.  So instead of those businesses going out of business, they are able to stay together, figure out how to keep it going, so that these workers can be taken care of. And that's -- I am hoping that the Congress can do that as quickly as possible.  WATTERS: I hope so, too. Juan, what do you think about the prospects up on Capitol Hill with getting this package out as soon as possible?  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Well, I'm sort of disappointed that the Senate hasn't acted. You know, the House passed the bill. The president backed the bill. But so far, Mitchell McConnell says good things but nothing has happened. And the House is away this week, so it's been a little bit -- to me, I'm in -- you know, I think Dana's corner here on let's get something done and let's do it now.  Because you hear big companies, Marriott, you know, some of the coffee people laying off large numbers of people as they shut down hotels, the coffee shops, obviously restaurants, casinos, airlines are in big -- we're -- as a country, we need the airlines to function. So I don't think there's any doubt that it's in our interest to do some kind of major bailout.  Now, let me just say in terms of the president, though, Jessie. I think I'm on another page, because I salute the fact that he pivoted yesterday. He said -- he now says this is a bad one. But it's taken him a very long time to get here. And then we see the consequences of that delay and lack of seriousness he brought to this subject in terms of the most recent poll.  A Marist Poll out today, 60 percent of Americans don't trust what our president has to say on this issue. That's pretty shocking. And it's 66 percent of independent voters. And in terms of disapproving, 49 percent of Americans disapprove of how he's handled this. So you can see that what we're getting from the president is a problem for lots of Americans.  Instead, they put their trust, high numbers, 70, 80 percent in the experts like Dr. Fauci.  WATTERS: Well, they don't put any trust in the U.S. media. I wonder, Greg, if one of the reasons maybe the president got to where he is today. It's because it's very difficult for any president, especially a president with a successful business background to in a time of crisis tell the country, don't go to work. Don't shop. Don't spend. Don't come together.  Essentially telling the U.S. economy you have to shut down in order to start back up and get better. That's a very difficult thing for anybody to do.  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Well, Juan mentioned the consequences and the consequences were not actions. It was a poll. I don't care about polls. I care about actions. He was -- at the beginning of this crisis, was trying to address and quell a panic when he saw it happening in the stock market. That was when he saw his role.  He got out of the way of the experts. He has Anthony Fauci handling that. And we are getting every single thing that we need. We are attacking this thing 100 percent. So I think that, like, you know, worrying about polls, you can have that. Have fun, whatever. There's good news. There's good news to talk about. I think that the preparedness and what we've been doing is working.  It doesn't look right now that the virus is spreading exponentially, which is good but we don't know. And I think actually, on a fun level, I mean, it's having an effect on people personally. Like, you know, I'm spending a lot of time with my wife.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: Is she happy about that?  GUTFELD: So I'm eating last night and she -- I'm eating the steak. And I go, wow, this is great. Did you do this? She goes, yeah, I cooked it. She cooked four meals. And she said this is the most I've ever cooked in my life. And I'm thinking if this goes on for a month, I can have a great chef. Meanwhile, I'm doubling up on my exercise and trying to focus on, like, endurance and explosive strength.  So you will never find another time in your life to focus this much on self-improvement. You can do so many things. And some of these behaviors could become permanent, like shopping off hours. I don't really do that, drinking at home, that's a good thing. Turning hand sanitizer into moonshine, prisoners are doing that.  I might do that. But it might be a time to apply self measures now that can be permanent. And it's really good to learn -- just try to learn something.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: -- Rumba classes for free.  GUTFELD: Rumba?  PERINO: Yeah.  GUTFELD: That's -- you -- that's --  PERINO: I don't know, some of sort of like Rumba. I don't know. I don't even know how to dance, except for the two-step which I can do very well.  DR. NICOLE SAPHIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: I would have to say --  (CROSSTALK)  SAPHIER: I'm quite happy to be outside right now. I'm taking social distancing to the extreme. But it's great to be on with all of you guys. I just want to say, you know, as we're seeing all the talk about the economic stimulus package. And I know that the Trump administration is getting a lot of criticism for spending so much money.  I think it's important to remember that -- this needs to be differentiated from the financial crisis in 2009. That was a bailout. What we are dealing with right now is a rescue mission of our small businesses, our travel industry, all of which we -- not only depend on for personal reasons, but professional reasons.  And the reason that things are amping up right now is because the Imperial College report just came out showing the data from all the epidemiological modeling, which shows the impact that this pandemic can actually have on the United States. And it talks about the importance of suppressing and mitigating the viral infection.  And that is exactly why they're doing it. And they're saying we have to do these certain steps. We have to do it now. And it has to be an entire country's effort in order to mitigate the spread and not overwhelm our healthcare system. And to be honest, I think the administration is tackling it from both standpoints, the economic, as well as the public health perspective.  PERINO: Jesse, can I make one point? Just on the point of the Senate, the Senate received the House bill this morning at 9:45:00 a.m. because they had to do all the technical corrections. So I don't think that there -- that lacks. The thing I'm concerned about is that it could take a month or two to actually get this money out the door.  I know they have to dot the I's and cross the T's. But I think they're moving us weekly as they can.  WATTERS: Well, Greg is waiting for his $1,000 check. He cannot wait to spend that money.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: That's right.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Everybody is eating chicken. There's a lot of steak.  WATTERS: All right, got a lot of explosive strength down there, keep up the good work. Coming up, college students packing beaches for spring break even after officials warned young people are the key to stopping the spread to of the virus.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WILLIAMS: While millions of Americans are seeing life drastically changed by the Coronavirus outbreak, college students are hitting up the beaches for spring break like everything is normal. Florida, South Carolina seeing large crowds, even though the White House is now recommending that Americans avoid groups of 10 or more people. Florida finally starting to crack down, here is governor Ron DeSantis earlier today.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Universities being with the spring break and the two week -- a lot of students have just been congregating at the universities and going out and doing things there. And that's not something we want. We've also seen issues related to spring break with some of the beaches. What we are going to be doing is simply for the state-wide floor for beaches is applying the CDC guidance of no group on a beach more than 10. And you have to have distance apart if you're going to be out there.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: And top health officials have repeatedly warned that young people take necessary precautions, and they will be the key to stopping the virus.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are asking the young people to help us with this mitigation strategy, by staying out of the bar, staying out of the restaurants, really trying to distance yourself. Don't get the attitude, well, I am young. I'm invulnerable. We can't do this without the young people cooperating.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: In fact, Dr. Deborah Birx, who is one of the experts on the White House panel, has made it clear that young people might be the core group in terms of stopping or at least mitigating the spread of the disease. Dr. Saphier, let me go to you and ask. What about the young people? I know there are lots. I'm not trying to pick on young people.  All of us -- all Americans have to do something. But when the young people think it's cool to go to the beach on spring break or hang out at the bar, I think they are spreading the disease.  SAPHIER: Well, sure. So I have a 20-year-old son. So I'm very familiar with this age group. And it was just last summer that I remember AOC saying that the millennials and the Gen Z generation that they are -- they're going to take it to the streets. And they're a lot of informed than the rest of Americans, and that they're not going to trust the government to take over.  Well, it's really interesting, because they are still taking it to the streets. The bottom line is we heard Dr. Fauci. We heard Dr. Birx earlier to say, yes, we understand that it is not the young people necessarily having severe symptoms when it comes to this illness. But they absolutely are mitigating -- they're not helping in mitigating of the spread of the disease.  Because you can be an asymptomatic carrier or they made themselves even just be a mild carrier, having those large groups together, they are continuing to spread this illness and putting they're our more vulnerable populations at risk. They need to take responsibility. This will not just take an individual municipality or state. It will take our entire nation to work together to get us past this.  WILLIAMS: Hey, Greg. You know, you're a young yellow. So I am thinking to myself, you know, you know, you know how to party.  GUTFELD: Yes.  WILLIAMS: So what would you say --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: Party of one.  WILLIAMS: -- because -- no nasty comments here. Give Greg a chance. Greg, what would you say to these party animals?  GUTFELD: All right. So I don't think we should be surprised that young people engage in high-risk activity. At that age, young people already don't understand the effects of dumb behavior on their mortality. They have the highest death rates in car accidents, and they do really stupid things. Now, you want them to see how their behavior affects others, like gramps and granny.  And if they can't understand that, then they're not worth talking to. But that's the problem because now it's no longer about them. We almost need to lie to them. You have to tell them that it's a sexually-transmitted disease, because then they won't go to spring break. If you said this is, like, really -- this is worse than herpes, then they might go home.  But I do think that there needs to be consequences in order for them to understand the importance of this. Because obviously, to the doctor's point, congregating, asymptomatic spread, you combine those two things together, it ain't going to stop spreading. So these kids should stay home and drink at home like I do the responsible way. I drink at home under a sun lamp.  WILLIAMS: Is that right?  GUTFELD: Yeah.  WILLIAMS: Yeah.  SAPHIER: Greg makes an interesting point, which I wrote an entire book about the whole purpose of we respond to positive and negative reinforcement, especially this generation. So unless there is some sort of tangible, positive reinforcement, which is they're obviously not getting, they are going to have to have a negative reinforcement to follow what we need them to do to help us get through this crisis.  GUTFELD: Imprisonment, Doctor? Do you suggest imprisonment?  (CROSSTALK)  SAPHIER: No, and I don't even know what that is. And public health doesn't necessarily take in the ethical or economical toll that this is going to have on our country. But the purpose is -- I feel that we have a lack of incentives for anything these days, even just living healthy. And this generation specifically is really bad at that.  WILLIAMS: All right. So Jesse, you are the closest sample we have here to one of these young people at the beach. What would you say to your peers?  WATTERS: My peers, thanks, Juan. I mean, telling a college student to practice social distancing is like telling Dana Perino to stay away from Jasper.  PERINO: Yeah. That would be really tough.  WILLIAMS: These kids are young. They're dumb. They don't understand consequences. Their hormones are raging. And they are very selfish people. Like, Hannity tried to cancel spring break. Hannity couldn't even cancel spring break. And what are you going declare, martial law? You're going to close all the beaches and the bars and lock up any kid that's out past curfew?  You can't do it. So as someone that went to spring break and then reported on spring break, I am a spring break veteran. So I will say, out of respect, young college students, for your parents and your grandparents who are paying your college tuition to go to spring break and cut loose, don't do it. Now, are they going to listen to me?  No, especially the SEC schools, they are like an unstoppable force. Maybe the Big 10 or the ACC, but these kids are going to do what they want and just think about it. Just think about it.  WILLIAMS: Thank you. Dana, a little criticism for Congressman Devin Nunes who said if you're feeling good, go out, have dinner, go to a bar. Now people are saying what are you telling these young people?  PERINO: Look, I'm just listening to Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx and the public health professionals. Those are who I'm listening to. I like the meme that the -- it said your grandparents were asked to go war. You are being asked to sit on a couch. Surely, you can do that. I also -- I like this chart. You know, I like a chart -- if you can --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: This is from the New York Times. It basically said if you can avert ever one case, then -- 2,400 get averted within a week. See right here. That's a visual thing you can show young people. But here's the other thing I would say. As future employers of these people, if you find out that any of these people that you think you might hire went to spring break or went to the bar or disregarded public health officials.  I wouldn't hire them. If they posted on social media, believe me, I will find it. And you will not get hired. That's the kind of punishment that they will listen to.  WILLIAMS: You know, Dana, you're a tough customer.  PERINO: Absolutely.  WILLIAMS: Coming up, Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders facing off in three primaries tonight amid the Coronavirus pandemic. Stay with us. We will give you the latest here on THE FIVE.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PERINO: Welcome back. Before we go onto this political segment, I do want to say to all the millennials. I understand that Generation Z are really the ones that are causing the problems and that you are much more responsible. And so when it comes to your employment, I'll take that into consideration. We'll move on now.  So we have a Coronavirus outbreak. It's ongoing. And Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are facing off tonight in three big primaries, Arizona, Florida, and Illinois. So the decision to send voters to the polls is causing some controversy. Ohio delayed its primary, which was supposed to happen today, at the very last minute over public health concerns.  Joe Biden is anticipating another big night, but it looks like Sanders isn't going anywhere. Aides for the senator saying he's not planning on dropping out of the race even if he has a poor showing. And this is interesting. Allies for Joe Biden reportedly think Elizabeth Warren could be a potential running mate. And it's a good thing I'm sitting down, Juan.  Or I don't know if I would have been able to handle that latest bit of news. Let me get your take on today. Obviously, there is going to be a lower turnout than what you saw on previous dates, because we are all trying to follow the orders of Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx -- what we're supposed to do it responsibly. But there is an election that's ongoing. What are you hearing from any of the Democrats today?  WILLIAMS: Well, you know, it's sort of inside the Biden campaign. It's really interesting, Dana, because what you just highlighted is their principal concern. Obviously, Joe Biden has some momentum going into this. But part of his success has been seen in higher rates of turnout especially in the suburbs near big cities.  And what you can anticipate with, first, people canceling or delaying elections, is it going to take away some of that momentum potentially. But then it also breeds conspiracy theories and when do you reschedule and who is going to turn out when you reschedule. But the bigger point is that when I was coming to which is if you see lower turnout.  There's not much you can extrapolate from who is actually interested in this election, who's going to vote, who you can go to later on and say I like you to help us organize. I'd like you to become a surrogate in this campaign. And that's very valuable to candidates running in the primary.  PERINO: Yeah. And Greg, even if -- well, whoever does well tonight in those three contests, it's not like they're going to get a big media bounce out of it because we're going to be focused on the crisis at hand of the Coronavirus.  GUTFELD: I just -- I find it strange that they're doing this for a couple of reasons. I already kind of know this is going to be the nominee. So it's watching after MASH. Do you remember the sequel to MASH?  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Yeah. It was -- why are you there when Archie Bunker had Archie Bunker's place and he bought a bar and he had that kid living with him. It made no sense to me at all. But the other thing, too, is I think they should've rescheduled this, because, you know, we are canceling a lot of things. Why is this any different?  Are they putting politics before the voters' health? A lot of old people get out there and vote. And I think it will depress the numbers. And I think it puts people at risk. I think rescheduling hurts both sides equally. Lastly, Liz Warren could only be Joe Biden's V.P., if she self identifies as Kamala Harris.  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Well, and I also believe, Jesse, that Elizabeth Warren's people are probably the ones that are planning that story.  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: You know how that goes?  WATTERS: Yes, that's a nice little plant by E. Warren. But I don't think it matters. She didn't have that much support in the first place. So what does it add? It adds a female. Does he need that? Not so sure. And it adds --  PERINO: Well, he already said he's going to do that.  WATTERS: Right. But I don't know if she's the one that you want to ride with. Although according to my bumper sticker theory, Biden-Warren does fit nicely. With that said, I do think this coronavirus news cycle just locks in the conventional wisdom that Biden is ahead and he stays ahead. And it prevents him from having to go out and give televised speeches to people and stick his foot in his mouth.  I also understand in the general election, the conventional wisdom says that this is going to help Biden because the economy is going to go down for a little bit. But it also -- it keeps him out of the news because he can't get any airtime. His donors, they're broke now. I mean, look at the stock market. The money is drying up. Fortunes are leaving pretty quickly. And I just don't see Joe rise to the occasion.  The President, on the other hand, is exercising an enormous amount of power over the country. He's engineering an economic recovery. He's rallying the country around a threat, and he's trying to protect people's health and their pocketbook. So if you get out of this thing, and this thing bounces back, the President is going to get a lot of credit come --  PERINO: There's a long way to go between now and then. But let me ask -- do we have time to play the sound from the governor of Ohio who did delay? OK, let's play this and have the doctor respond on whether this was a good move.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  GOV. MIKE DEWINE (R-OH): We have 35,000 poll workers that takes to put on an election. I'm sure our viewers have experienced. They're wonderful people. Some have been doing this for a long, long time, some for decades. So some are -- some are older, more at-risk individuals. So this is a disease or this is a virus that sometimes people can't tell they have it.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: Doctor Saphier, that is an interesting point I think about the poll workers. They are often older and they volunteer their time.  SAPHIER: You know, I've never actually been to a poll where someone actually took my ballot that wasn't under the age of 65. This is a very crucial point. The majority of the poll workers are retirees or senior citizens. But I mean, Ohio has nearly 70 cases right now. That number is likely going to double very soon. He's doing the responsible thing.  If we're saying we're going to close our restaurants in our bars, and we want everyone to stay in their home. The thought of having people lining up outside of these small polling stations is absolutely the responsible thing to do for his people.  PERINO: All right, Dr. Nicole, thank you. Up next, don't miss Greg's monologue on how we can help ourselves and our communities fight the coronavirus outbreak. He said he's going to be totally positive.  GUTFELD: Yes.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: As we realize we're in this thing together, people are stepping up to help each other. For example, a college student launched a shopping program for at-risk people in Nevada. Others have done similar things all over, including this young woman.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  MAGGIE CONNOLLY, HELPS ELDERLY NEIGHBORS: It has a very large elderly community here. And I was just really worried that the people, those people, those neighbors weren't getting what they needed. And we also got another e-mail late last night from a mom with a newborn in Brooklyn whose husband sick. So we're setting up to get some stuff to her this morning, too.  I had so many people reach out both in the neighborhood to volunteer, but then also all over the world sending me pictures of their signs that they're making, which I think is so huge.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: So shouldn't doing good things be a competitive sport since all the other ones are canceled? A virtue-signaling Olympics but with real virtue. Not the kind of phony virtue on social media where a pop star tweets an inspirational phrase that she Googled a minute ago. That's zero cost with zero benefit.  By the way, it's odd how our most famous celebrity crusaders have gone silent. My guess, they're in their guarded seclusion, and I'm sure the gun control zealots among them are armed to the hilt. As for you do good things that make you feel good. Granted, it's hard in isolation, but small things matter. Oddly, even washing your hands should make you feel heroic because you're killing germs and sharing, yes, even sharing your toilet paper.  One guy actually started a toilet paper exchange on a California street corner. His homemade sign read share your toilet paper, and it's working. Why? Because good deeds make you feel less crappy. It's not virtue signaling, but virtue doing. We saw idiots hoarding toilet paper and true to their mimetic nature, people copied it. So why not initiate good behavior and hope people copy that too.  This is also a good time to eat better, exercise more, practice that guitar gathering dust on the wall. Now's the time to be your better self. It's the opposite of every panic imagined by our entertainment industry. Prove them wrong by doing things right once again.  PERINO: Yes.  GUTFELD: Dana, you were telling me a story about a young boy.  PERINO: Yes. Well, he's in high school. This is James Dobin Smith. He was the son of one of my very best friends in the world. And they live up in Westport. And he created a Web site, and like one day, they came to him, it's called OneWestport.com. And I think that's going to happen all over the country.  Basically, it's a site where local businesses can sign up and then you can go and buy gift cards for each of those businesses, but it's like a one- stop shopping place, so you can be supportive of your local community. And I think that's also very important, which is figuring out what is needed right here.  There's a guy named Greg Danson, who -- down in Dallas said, let me try to do something like that young girl from Fox and Friends. How can I help in my community? Well, it caught on and now there's popping up in San Diego and Virginia. So it's contagious in a good way.  GUTFELD: Exactly. Exactly. Bad behaviors, like, Jesse, when you see people at black -- on Black Friday, they're fighting over stuff they don't know why. Why can't we reverse that behavior by you Jesse being an example of a selfless person? What are you going to do for America, Jesse?  WATTERS: Greg, I recognize a cry for help when I see one. And I know you're at an at-risk age, so this is what I'm going to do. I'm going to leave the show at six and I'm going to go grocery shopping for you.  GUTFELD: Oh, thank you.  WATTERS: You're going to make me a list. You get whatever you want, ribs, T-bones, OK. I will bring it to your doorstep. You don't have to get out of your house. You can -- I'll just bring it to your doorstep. I don't want to get too close. And then you can have whatever you want for dinner. I will even go to the pharmacy and get your prescription drugs, OK. We know you need your meds. I will be there to save you from yourself. And that is the way I am going to be helping out America.  In all seriousness though, Ivanka Trump has a hashtag now, it's called #TogetherApart, which she's doing a lot of the things you're talking about. So even if you're home alone, you nurture your children, you spend more time with your spouse, and you help a neighbor. So there's many things one can do in a time when we were apart. We can come together.  GUTFELD: You know, Juan, the upside of not having kids like me, you have a lot of leftover cash. That's the only thing I'm good for.  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: You can tell me about it. I spent mine.  GUTFELD: But that can throw money at problems. If you have a problem, just don't e-mail me, OK. Juan, what are you doing? What are you doing to make the world a better place?  WILLIAMS: Well, first of all, here's my idea for you, Greg.  GUTFELD: Yes.  WILLIAMS: You know, I think that you should have called this segment I love these people. You know, you have, I hate these people?  GUTFELD: Yes.  WILLIAMS: I've been pushing you. I think God, you are going -- God's going to smile on you, Greg, if you say I love these people, and you love what these young people are doing, right?  GUTFELD: Yes, definitely.  WILLIAMS: So I think that's a great idea. Now the one thing I would say to you is, even if Jesse comes to help you, there's still a place for government, for robust government, and institutions that we trust to respond to this crisis. After 9/11, we needed government to step up and do1 its thing. And we need government right now to step up and take constructive action to help us all.  So you know, we can talk about individuals, but I don't think we should somehow, you know, the libertarian bent and you may say, you know what, government always bet. But I think government does perform. It performed after 9/11. We want government at its best right now.  GUTFELD: Well, I mean, it's this. They all come together, private and government together working hand in hand. I'm going to --  PERINO: Bernie Sanders' worst nightmare.  GUTFELD: Yes. I'm going to start singing Barbra Streisand song, doctor. Before we -- there is like a biological response to doing good stuff. It makes you feel better. It's actually -- it can be selfish because it makes you feel better.  SAPHIER: Well, let me tell you, actually, you know, I work at one of the largest cancer hospitals in our country. And I tell you, the volunteers that come to work there who maybe have never volunteered else any other time, they say that they honestly have been the happiest they've ever been. Because although it may be hard, it really does give them this positive feedback, and they realize they're doing more.  So I think it's great we're covering these stories. And, you know, it takes -- it's a little bit of different approach. Because people love to look at a bad car crash, but it's even -- you know, we're all addicted to that for some reason. But now if we continue to show these positive stories, as you see, there is a trickledown effect. We may be having other people do it as well. And I implore you --  PERINO: Can I make one other point, Greg?  SAPHIER: -- even if you're going to help just one person, it's a great thing.  PERINO: The other thing I was going to say is if you have people in your life that you pay on an hourly basis, like a dog walker, or a trainer or somebody like that, and now they're not allowed to come to your building and they can't come to the neighborhood or they're sheltering in place. I think if you have the means, you know, continue to pay them.  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: Because that will help -- the government is going to help. They're already going to help. But I do think that this is something that we should all commit to. If you have the means to do it, try to keep paying your people.  GUTFELD: All right, we're going to take a break from the coronavirus. Up next, another big story. The second most famous alumni of Serra High School, NFL legend Tom Brady -- the first is me -- is leaving the Patriots.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  SAPHIER: All right. All right, well, welcome to the -- welcome back. Another big story people are talking about, NFL legend Tom Brady making a surprise announcement that he is leaving the New England Patriots after 20 seasons.  Now guys in the world of coronavirus, that's all we're talking about right now. But I see the sports world is actually kind of in an uproar right now. I mean, I've been following it a little bit on social media and it seems to be, you know, it's quite the situation. So, Jesse, I have a question. Do you think that Tom Brady leaving is going to be the end of the dynasty or the Patriots going to actually recover and stay as strong?  WATTERS: No, I think it's not the end. Listen, the guy is probably what, he's asking for $40 million for a year. He's got a year or two left. He's about 42 years old. He's a system quarterback that Craft and Belichick have to be thinking. We cut this guy lose, and we just load up in the offseason, stack the deck on offense and defense and make another run for a ring.  It will be weird to see him in another jersey. Remember when Jordan went to the Washington Wizards and was wearing blue, it's going to be hard to wrap your head around that. I think you'll probably wind up with the Rams in Southern California. You know, it's great weather, Hollywood, they got a good running back out there, some wide receivers. He's a California kid, like Greg Gutfeld. I think that's where he lands.  SAPHIER: So Greg, do you actually think that this is good timing to be discussing contract negotiations and not being able to come up with a multi-million dollar salary and the time of $850 billion stimulus package everyone is complaining about?  GUTFELD: I think life goes on. And it's good when you have other things -- this tells people that life does go on. It trends on Twitter which says, life goes on. But let's be honest here. Tom Brady is a failure. How many Super Bowls does he won? Six. In one -- so he's won six championships in one sport. So he has like one talent, OK. What have I done?  I have three shows, right? I have THE FIVE. I have the GG Show. I had Red Eye. I edited Maxim, I edited Stuff Magazine, I edited Men's Health. So in this universe of Serra High School graduates, he has one singular talent. I tower over him, tower over him, and he's making $40 million. God, that just makes me so mad.  SAPHIER: Well, and the one person who doesn't have just one talent, Dana Perino --  PERINO: Oh, thank you.  SAPHIER: Who is known -- who has -- knows a lot of every little thing. Dana, what do you make of it?  PERINO: Well, I think that second acts are very hard to pull off. And he's had this really wonderful like comfortable space like everybody loves in there. My condolences to our colleagues, Martha McCallum, Jay Wallace, Tyrus, they are big Tom Brady fans, Patriot fans, and I know they're very upset today.  But this is the other thing I'd say from a communications perspective. If you have bad news that is going to come out in your life, now is the time to get it out. Between now and the next seven days, get that out of there.  GUTFELD: Andrew Gillum --  WATTERS: I'd love to make an announcement.  SAPHIER: What do think, Juan? Do you think that Tom Brady's fans are going to follow him or are they going to stay true to the Patriots?  WILLIAMS: I think his wife is leaving him for Greg. That's what I think. I that's imminent. That's imminent. That's the bad news Dana is talking about.  GUTFELD: My wife is better looking.  WILLIAMS: Oh, listen here. Here's the thing.  PERINO: Come on, make an argument.  WILLIAMS: I'm not sure --  WATTERS: She's not watching, Greg.  WILLIAMS: I'm not sure we're going to have --  PERINO: I mean, maybe.  WILLIAMS: I'm not sure we're going to have a next football season. If that's the case, I don't know what happens. He may sign. Right now, the talk is he's going to sign with Tampa Bay or the Chargers. Both have good offensive lines, can protect him. But the question is, what's next for Tom Brady. And you know, the money is not it. And it may be the Hollywood career.  He's starting a documentary company. Maybe he's going out to L.A. But as I say at the moment, I wonder if this is it. By the way, Jesse, the last pass, an interception against I believe your team, the Eagles.  WATTERS: That's right.  SAPHIER: All right. I don't know if I agree that money -- it's not all about the money. But anyways, so ""ONE MORE THING"" is up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WATTERS: It's time now for ""ONE MORE THING."" Let's do a Feeding Frenzy.  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: Wait. I'm going to get --  WATTERS: All right --  PERINO: Jesse, there's no food down here.  WATTERS: Oh, I got it up here, Dana. You're going to have to take a walk. Lucky Charms, everybody. Just in time for St. Patrick's Day, they have a St. Patrick's Day edition. It is chocolate and original flavored. We got new gold coin marshmallows with green shamrocks and pot of gold. Check this out. We're going to take a sample here.  GUTFELD: Hey, Jesse --  PERINO: It's like unfair.  GUTFELD: This is a terrible time for them. I would call them unlucky charm.  WATTERS: This is so good. Hey Greg, if you want me to bring some of these - -  GUTFELD: Yes.  WATTERS: Thanks to General Mills to your house tonight, I know you're at risk. I will be your shopping angel.  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: Does it come with one of the outfits to dress up in?  WATTERS: No, Dana. That would be cultural appropriation. We don't do that on THE FIVE.  PERINO: Oh we don't. OK, got it.  WATTERS: Juan, you're up.  WILLIAMS: Thank you. Thank you. Mel Brooks is one of my favorite comedians. I mean, you know him. At 93, he has in his resume Blazing Saddles, The Producers. Now, he and his son Max have done a terrific -- I mean, absolutely wonderful -- I'm going to show it to you in a second -- public service announcement. Here's Max and Mel. Max is 43. Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  MAX BROOKS, SON OF MEL BROOKS: If I get the coronavirus, I'll probably be OK. But if I give it to him, he could give it to Carl Reiner, who could give it to Dick Van Dyke. And before I know it, I've wiped out a whole generation of comedic legends.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: Hey, that's great advice. No belly laughs but just good advice. Thanks to Mel and thanks to Max, father and son, for helping America.  WATTERS: Very good. OK. Dana Perino.  PERINO: All right. So, everybody's hunkering down, a lot of things are closed, including aquariums, but these penguins were granted the chance to explore without any restriction on their movement. This is Chicago Shedd Aquarium. It closed to the public on Friday. And then these penguins, one is named Wellington, the other Monty, they got to just walk around and just see everything. And it's a cute little video that you can find on social media.  You know, they looked around, look at all that food they could be eating and what was available. And Jerry Dunleavy who's somebody I follow, he said, let it -- making those penguins do that was like -- would be like putting him in a Chick-Fil-A. It was closed on Sunday and it couldn't get any food.  WATTERS: Some pretty pretentious names. Wellington and Monte for a penguin? My goodness. I think they'll get a little carried away. Greg Gutfeld.  GUTFELD: All right, let's do this. Greg's Workout Tips. We're all kind of pent up. We're all getting back into exercise. But I think you got to start out slow. Check out this little fellow. He knows how to do it. He is actually -- what he's doing is he's concentrating on his weak limb because he knows that the other -- his right -- his right paw, Dana. And he's trying to get his left paw in shape.  And look at him. He's got that look of just I don't give a damn. I'm going to get through this. We're all going to be great.  PERINO: Everyone is going to be fine.  GUTFELD: Yes.  WATTERS: Working on his explosive speed just like Gutfeld. All right, Doctor, take us home.  SAPHIER: All right, well, the time of taking necessary precautions. I just want to remind everyone, you can still have a good time. Keep -- take a look at what one Massachusetts family did to celebrate.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  CROWD: Happy Birthday dear Millie. Happy Birthday to you.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  SAPHIER: All right, well, that's how they -- Millie Erickson's family. celebrated her 100th anniversary outside of the nursing home.  WATTERS: Beautiful. All right, set your DVRs.

46,FOX,"Sanders, Biden debate amid coronavirus pandemic. Sunday's debate between former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., felt like watching a ""Lawrence Welk"" re-run. It was something from the past that holds no relevance now. They talked about porous borders, as hardworking people close shops and restaurants. Climate change predictions that never predict anything? Sorry, we're dealing with real threats now. MARY ANNE MARSH: IN BIDEN-SANDERS DEBATE, SOLUTIONS WIN AND REVOLUTION LOSES Promising to shut down the oil that helps families during a crisis? Give me a break. Yes, watching two candidates try to out-left each other, when nothing left really works, is surreal. So, let's note what their priorities were, for so many months. Check out Joe Concha's tweet: CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER These candidates didn't even address the virus until a few weeks ago. What did they fill their time with at the debate? Did they bash big pharma, you ask? That's a good question! ""We have a bunch of crooks who are running the pharmaceutical industry,"" Sanders said. ""You need to take on the drug companies. ... We tell the pharmaceutical industry, we tell the big money interests, that this is not a time for profiteering."" Biden said, ""We should be able to sue drug companies."" And Sanders also said, ""You've got people in the pharmaceutical industry who are saying, 'oh, wow, what an opportunity to make a fortune! ... The drug companies will not rip us off."" Wow! I guess that nonsense wouldn't fly right now, or last night as we rely on drug companies to find a vaccine and save lives. But I'm sure there was something else preoccupied their minds during the debate. Remember impeachment? Ah, those were the days. When they wasted precious time because all they wanted was Trump's scalp, which prevented them from eyeing real threats. Which did three things. One, it occupied efforts that then distracted us from other things, like a really weird outbreak in China. -- Some saw it. It also further discredited the media. With its ""boy who cried wolf"" addiction, everything is apocalyptic, so nothing is. Finally, it reinforces Trump's belief that the media and Democrats are out to get him because they have been out to get him all along! CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP We always suspected Democrats and the media couldn't walk and chew gum at the same time. We were right. If only they would walk and just keep going.

47,FOX,"Schools, restaurants, businesses close to prevent virus spreading; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" March 16, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino, along with Greg Gutfeld, Jesse Watters, Juan Williams, and Kennedy. It's 5:00 in New York City. This is THE FIVE. All right, as you can see, we are doing things a little bit differently today and going forward. As much as we love sitting elbow to elbow and we mean that sincerely. We want to set a good example for everyone and practice physical distancing. So here we are. Oh, are we going to see? Like, we're separate - - so Greg and I are here, having to face each other, Juan and Jesse are up there. You can see them. Kennedy, we see you there in the pod, hi, Kennedy. So we're all trying to do the right thing here. And the reason, of course, is because life in our country is changing by the minute. In an unprecedented effort to help contain this Coronavirus, millions of Americans are working from home. And school closings across the U.S. are impacting more than half of young students in the country. Cities and states closing bars and restaurants with the exception of take-out, Greg's happy about that. GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Yup. PERINO: And San Francisco and surrounding counties telling residents to shelter in place for the next three weeks. Earlier today, the White House issuing new guidelines to slow the spread of the virus over the next 15 days, and that includes limiting social gatherings to less than 10 people to help stop the spread of the virus. Here is more from the president. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: My focus is really on getting rid of this problem, this virus problem. Once we do that, everything else is going to fall into place. We're not thinking in terms of recession. We are thinking in terms of the virus. Once we stop -- I think there's a tremendous pent-up demand both in terms of the stock market and terms of the economy. If you don't have the symptoms, if your doctor doesn't think you need it, don't get the test. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: The president also weighing in on the progress being made on a vaccine. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: A vaccine candidate has begun the phase one clinical trial. This is one of the fastest vaccine development launches in history, not even close. We're also racing to develop antiviral therapies and other treatments that we've had some promising results, early results but promising. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: Greg, let's start with you. I don't know whether to look at you. I will look at the camera. GUTFELD: It's weird because basically you are just across from me. PERINO: Yes. GUTFELD: And so I can block -- I can touch your face without touching your face, which is really freaky. PERINO: Don't touch my face. I can't even touch my own face. GUTFELD: Yes. So anyway, first of all, the -- you can not now meet beyond a group of 10 people, which means Sunday's Lou Dobbs' hot tub party -- we're going to have to reschedule to August. But I'm actually pretty tired. I have friends that are kind of bumming me out, who keep saying that we are overdoing it. And I knew that we are all hearing it. But I say I would prefer to look back and be wrong and look back and be foolish then think about, oh, I didn't do enough. So I am willing to bite the bullet now, peel that band-aid off. And you may never know if your overreaction helped. Because -- and the people who under reacted are going to gloat and say, see, it was no big deal at all, even though it was the over reactors that might have helped. And I also want to say something very positive. Yesterday, my neighbor, who was about 80, came over and let me know that she had plenty of food. PERINO: Sweet. GUTFELD: And she said me and Elena are welcome to come over. And I was thinking about how when you watch these movies about the apocalypse or -- the entertainment industry makes us falsely believe that during times of crisis, human's turn on each other, like, we are fighting over toilet paper and chicken. It's not the case. The innate reaction among human beings is to help. You know, if you have a problem carrying something or you can't pick up your kids, someone else is going to do it. And I think that's what we are going to learn here. I would also add a lot of people talk about social distancing. We should be social distancing from social media, because I find that when I'm around and I'm on Twitter a lot. I am filling my brain with a lot of stuff that is unreliable. And I think I should step away. It's also like the stock ticker. I wish they would take that down because it just makes me -- I don't need to watch it. PERINO: As you said in green room, we're talking about watching water boil, doesn't really get you anywhere. Kennedy, I know that you are experiencing what many parents across America are experiencing. Your kids are home. How is that going? LISA KENNEDY MONTGOMERY, GUEST HOST: It's very interesting. The whole process, it unfolds so quickly. So I have two girls in public schools here in New York City. And last week, toward the end of the week, there were fewer and fewer students who are attending. My girls both went on Friday, and there was almost no one there. And you really got the sense with the threatened teacher stick out and a couple of the city council people here in New York City that they were going to shut down schools. And for them, it's interesting because they have a ton of work on Google classroom. So they've got everything laid out. But also, it's an interesting period where we get to work as a family figuring out how to deal with the crisis. And the most important thing you have, and Greg kind of touched on this, is your attitude toward it. So if you face it as a challenge and you work on it together and we figure what we have and what we need, then you can work from there instead of worrying about what you don't have and trying to get as much of that as possible even if you don't necessarily have a need for that. I know the president's addressed that today. And I love the idea that Greg's neighbor reached out to him. And I would say the same thing. If you have older neighbors, make sure that they have everything they need so they don't have to go out and get it. And if you're making soup, if you've got extras, freeze some and take it over so they've -- to put their minds at ease and get them whatever they need from the drugstore. PERINO: And also your household will benefit from the fact that you are a fabulous cook. I am not, though I tried a little bit this weekend. Jesse, how about you? How is the weekend and what are you thinking about things today? JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST: Well, I went to visit my mom this weekend. And she made me wear gloves to come inside of her house. She is suspicious that I might have Coronavirus. And I wore the gloves all afternoon in the house. And that's what it is. I didn't take the social distancing that seriously Friday, Saturday, and Sunday night. I went out to dinner here in the city. And I woke up this morning and I realized that was not the right move. I am no longer going out to dinner. I was trying to help my local restaurants. PERINO: Yeah. WATTERS: And we have stocked up on all the groceries and we went to the liquor store, and I bought about five bottles of wine and some vodka. So I'm good for about a week. Not two, but at least one week. But I urge all my fellow Americans, no matter where you are, to respect the social distancing urging from the president of the United States. And, you know, it can be a good thing. You can relax with your loved ones. You can watch THE FIVE. You don't have to go out to the bar. You know, take it easy. But with that said, it is bizarre because usually when there's a challenge facing this country, Americans unite. They come together. And then they overcome. But this time, in order for us to overcome, we need to separate ourselves from each other. We are almost dividing ourselves in order to unite and in order to defeat this virus. And that is a very counterintuitive thing to do. But you have to do it. And you have to think when this is all over, and it's got to be over within the next couple months. But when it is, Mother Nature has taught us a lesson. We are going to be more self-reliant. We are going to be less dependent as a country and as individuals on other people and on other countries. And that may be a good thing, because right now this looks like it's impacting the United States of America worse than terrorism. Thirty percent got knocked off the stock market. Whole industries are shut down, schools closing, professional sports. Nothing like this we've ever seen in America. And at the end of the day, we are going to have to find out what happened, why it happened, where it happened, and the lessons will be learned. PERINO: And of course, with terrorism is a threat that you know and you know how to combat it. When you're fighting against a virus that is mutating as we speak, that is harder. Juan, let's get you in here. And tell me about how you're feeling about things. Congress did pass or is about to pass some legislation to try to get to phase two of helping out these Americans who are going to need it. JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: I am glad you reached out to me, your elderly neighbor here, Dana, because at 65, I am in that group. PERINO: No, I hear you. I know. I know. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: So I mean, if you guys have soup, bring it over, you know? I am right here, you know? I will lap up Kennedy's soup or tacos or whatever she's got. PERINO: I will make some queso. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: We're going through enough problems, Dana. WATTERS: One emergency at a time. WILLIAMS: Yeah, I think that toilet paper rush will be justified. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: You know, I've had a crazy day just living in America today, because, you know, like all of a sudden, I hear Maria Bartiromo this morning on the debate last night. Then they say, OK, you can rush and get the 7:50 a.m. train. No, they cancelled all the Acela's that go between New York and D.C. And then they say we will put you on the milk train that leaves at 9:30, makes every stop in America. And then the people on the train are like in masks. They are huddled away from each other. Nobody wants to sit next to anybody. And of course, both towns, it looks like a ghost town because the schools are closed so the school buses aren't working. And you go in the restaurants, they are shut. You hope some that of the carry out places are open. But some of them are shut. So it's kind of puzzling. I mean, to me, we are in a moment where you have to just, you know, stop and trust in each other in a very intimate way. So, you know, to my mind, it's not about distancing. I see neighbors. The neighbors are coming over. They are talking. And I even saw a wonderful clip this weekend where an elderly couple was in a shopping -- outside of a grocery store in the parking lot. And they were shouting, and a lady came over and they were afraid to go in the grocery store. So they gave her 100 bucks so she could go shopping. PERINO: Well, and in fact, you know, corporate America and small businesses are really stepping to the plate, Greg. We're talking about, like, the public-private partnerships. But I believe Stop & Shop is going to have some hours in the morning, early hours that where you, as a senior citizen, you can go and shop early in the morning and feel a little bit safer, so people being quite innovative as well. GUTFELD: I'm used to doing that, because as a world recognized celebrity, I can only grocery shop in the early, early morning, so I don't get mobbed. We do hear about the large companies asking for money. But to Jesse's point, if you aren't going to the restaurant, those restaurants are suffering. And I -- and believe me, all of my money that I make goes into bars and restaurants. I am a walking, like, bailout for downtown. So what you've got to do is you've got to find out how you can pay them now for future goods. That's like the order of gift cards for the restaurants that you like. Join the delivery services, like Seamless or Grubhub or Caviar. These are delivery services and -- where any restaurant that you like can deliver food to you. That way, they can pay the staff. They can pay the cook. They might be able to help out the waitresses. But you should definitely -- if you buy the gift card, it gets into their system, and then you can use them when everything gets better. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: -- some people are complaining of that, because obviously if you are a waiter, you are living on tips. GUTFELD: Exactly. WILLIAMS: And so, you know, all of a sudden they say you have unemployment. And the bill that was passed yesterday by the House has some additional funding for that. But basically those people are being denied their tips. And so they are upset. And then a lot of people say if you buy the gift cards for the restaurants or whatever services, personal services you may need, it goes to, again, the big company. But it doesn't go down to the people who provide the services. (CROSSTALK) PERINO: We all have to be thinking about them. WILLIAMS: Just as we focused on people who making sure they can afford a test as well treatment alike. We just want to make sure that people who are, you know, kind of working class people don't get scrunched here or forgotten. WATTERS: Obviously, politics dominating, and the president facing a new wave of criticism over his handling of the Coronavirus pandemic. Former White House Communications Director turned never-Trumper, Anthony Scaramucci, comparing the president of the deadly virus. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, FORMER WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: Donald Trump is the virus. At the end of the day, what he has done, he's affected and replicated through the executive branch. And he's destroyed the crisis management elements of the executive branch that we need right now, not only here in the United States, but globally. It's a national tragedy born from one person. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: And New York Democratic Governor, Andrew Cuomo, piling on by blasting the Trump administration. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): This is a national problem and we need federal leadership. It's chaos. I think it actually feeds the feeling that the country is out of control. And there is no clear direction. And there is no clear path. It makes no sense. It is also counterproductive. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: President Trump firing back after a teleconference with the nation's governors, tweeting, quote, ""Cuomo of New York has to do more."" Kennedy, I like Anthony Scaramucci. I respect his opinion, but it's just a lazy analogy. They've used that in the New York Times, like, three weeks ago. It is not going to stick. What we need from everybody is a little sense of common purpose here. KENNEDY: You're absolutely right. And it doesn't mean you have to pat the president on the back and extolled his virtues and enumerate all the wonderful things that the administration has done. But being so negative and backward-looking, it is not helpful to anybody. And to destroy morale even further when people are scared and they are panicked. It doesn't do anything for this. And it just -- frankly, it makes him look bitter, because if you talk to Anthony Scaramucci after he was fired, he was essentially begging for his job back. And he has taken aim at several people in the administration that have been incredibly personal with his attacks. And I just have to wonder what his end game is, and if it is to make the country better then offer some solutions. WATTERS: Right. And Governor Cuomo, Dana, he's really stepped up, I guess, as the governor here in New York and taken it upon himself to issue a lot of directives, and has been holding a lot of press conferences. But doesn't he really kind of want to form a strong working relationship with the president of the United States, because this thing is going to continue for the next couple of months. PERINO: Yes. I actually think that they probably have a better relationship than we might think. WATTERS: Posturing may be. PERINO: Well, yeah. And so remember Cuomo went to the White House not too long ago to talk about taxes and other things. And look, they've known each other for years, and so maybe they can take shots at each other like this. But everybody gets a choice every single day of how they want to position themselves, what they want to say. Do you want to help? You get to make that choice 100 times a day. I did think that the governors today were doing the right thing. Now remember, the federal government cannot do everything for you. The governors are actually the ones that can make these decisions about closing schools and closing businesses. The president of the United States does not have that legal authority even if he wanted to. The governors are responsible for that. And I saw many of them stepping up today. I really have to say something really positive about Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey who gave his prepared remarks today, talked about having to close the bars, and then set aside the script and just spoke from the heart. And he said this is on me. And this -- I am doing this because I'm the one that's supposed to be in charge. I'm the one that is supposed lead. And so I'm making these decisions because I'm -- my credibility is on the line, because I'm here to -- as an elected leader to try to protect you. And I think you see that across the country. And I believe that there's a lot better cooperation between the federal government and governors that you see may be on Twitter. WATTERS: Juan, do you think that certain states are going to have to make their own decisions? And there's one case of Coronavirus in North Dakota, do they need to treat Coronavirus the same way New York treats Coronavirus which has nearly 1,000 cases? WILLIAMS: No. I mean, I think everybody has to sort of tailor it to their needs. But I do think that you need national leadership. And I think like last night at the Democratic debate, Bernie Sanders basically said Trump's rhetoric has exacerbated the problem, because Trump downplayed it and said, you know, it's the media. It's the Democrats. It's those people. And now it turns out, hey, there's a real problem here, and we should have been informing people about this very real threat to all of our health but to our public safety in terms of a health crisis long ago. And so he was saying, you know, it will go away. Don't worry about it. It will disappear like a miracle. Well, it's not disappearing like a miracle. So when it comes to the governors saying, you know, we like some more direction. The CDC reports to the president. You can't blame Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve Governor, the Chair. He's done everything. Yesterday, he cut the interest rates to zip. It still didn't help the markets. He wants to blame Obama. He wants to blame foreigners. Where is a president who says the buck stops here? WATTERS: I think with the president was saying is that if there's one case in Alaska, Juan, you don't just say from Washington, D.C. I'm going to close every school in Alaska. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: -- flexible and dynamic. WILLIAMS: Nobody was saying that you should take away flexibility. What you're saying is the national leader, the president of all of us, of Republicans and Democrats might offer some direction instead of giving us sort of happy, fluffy talk that, in fact, it distorted the reality that we are dealing with. And I didn't think, and I don't think anybody on THE FIVE, I don't think any of us here on THE FIVE -- just a second. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: -- communicated to the public every day. WILLIAMS: Jesse, he has not. Jesse, let me make this point. I don't think one of us here sitting on THE FIVE thought we would have to be sitting in little boxes because of this. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: And you didn't, Juan. I did. I talked about this in the third week of February. Anyway, anyway, can I actually weigh in on this, because you've been talking for a while? All right, number one, number one, Scaramucci, when you were booking Scaramucci to talk about a pandemic, that means seven to eight people turned them down beforehand. He is not the bottom of the barrel. He is the stuff leaking out of the barrel. When you are booking him, it's a political booking, so let's be clear. Two, people are conflating again with words and deeds. What Trump is doing imperfectly is he initially was trying to address the panic that he saw in the stock market, because he is our nation's cheerleader. Everything's going to be better. We have to get this thing going, because optimism is his blood, all right? As for the virus, that's the experts' turf. Make no mistake. He got out of that way. He let them do that. And let's not forget, Cuomo was slow getting up to speed on this too, because he was doing the same thing Trump was, which was just trying to slow the panic in the economy. So Trump was initially focusing on the psychological effects of panic. While his intention is good, he could've found his voice sooner about the actual concern. But he's -- this is new to him. I think he was trying to focus on trying to quell the panic while letting the experts deal with the virus, deeds, words. And right now, you cannot match the deeds of this administration. They are doing amazing work. WILLIAMS: Yeah. That's why we have so many tests to find out who has it. That's why we have a vaccine. Although, the president said the vaccine is coming in a couple weeks and now we know it is years. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: -- in the NSC, we don't have an office of global immune threats. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: plenty of -- look what's happening in Italy. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: Now, we want to compare our government to the Italians, very good, very good. WATTERS: Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders face-off in the shadow of this Coronavirus pandemic, Greg's monologue ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GUTFELD: Last night's debate felt like you are watching a Lawrence Welk rerun. Something from the past that holds no relevance now, talking about porous borders as hardworking people close shops and restaurants, climate change predictions that never predict anything? Sorry, we are dealing with real threats now. Promising to shutdown the oil that helps families during a crisis? Give me a break. Yup, watching two candidates try to out-left each other when nothing left really works is surreal. So let's note what their priorities were for so many months. Check out Joe Concha's tweet. These candidates in debates didn't address the virus until a few weeks ago. What did they fill the time with? Did they bash big pharma, you ask? That's a good question. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BERNIE SANDERS (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We have a bunch of crooks who are running the pharmaceutical industry. You need to take on the drug companies. We tell the pharmaceutical industry. We tell the big money interests that this is not a time for profiteering. JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We should be able to sue drug companies. SANDERS: You have got people in the pharmaceutical industry saying, wow, what an opportunity to make a fortune. The drug companies will not rip us off. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Wow. I guess that nonsense wouldn't fly right now, or last night, as we rely on drug companies to find a vaccine and save lives. But I'm sure there was something else that preoccupied their minds during those debates. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Impeachment. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Impeachment. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Impeachment. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Impeachment. SANDERS: These impeachment hearings. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We have an impeachment trial. BIDEN: He has, in fact, committed impeachable offenses. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Impeachment. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Impeachment. SANDERS: The impeachment process. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The impeachment must go forward. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Impeachment. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Impeachment. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Impeachment. BIDEN: We get an impeachment proceeding. SANDERS: I hope that he is impeached. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Ah, those were the days when they wasted precious time because all they wanted was Trump's scalp, which prevented them from eyeing real threats which did three things. It occupied efforts that then distracted us from other things like a really weird outbreak in China. Some saw it. It further discredited the media with its boy-who-cried-wolf addiction. Everything that is apocalyptic, so nothing is. It enforces Trump's belief that the media and Dems are out to get him, because they have been out to get him all along. We always suspected that the Dems and media couldn't walk and chew gum at the same time. We were right. If only they could walk and keep going. Dana, you and I have talked about this a lot. I find it hilarious that last night I don't think they've mention the pharmaceutical industry at all, because they need the pharmaceutical industry. They are a bunch of fatuous hypocrites. PERINO: Absolutely, fatuous hypocrites. GUTFELD: Sorry, I'm upset. PERINO: It's kind of interesting. I remember in one of the debates, they have had so many where Coronavirus didn't come up at all. And you are thinking wait. This is actually happening. Now, in 2000, neither Gore nor Bush was asked about Al Qaeda in the lead up to that in any -- never once by the media or in any debates. But we actually knew about Coronavirus. So, you know, last night, I thought that Biden could have said I'm not debating you. But obviously, the Democrat across the country have rejected your ideas, Bernie. So I don't even need to be here. Instead, he goes to the debate after Bernie, as Trump -- as Chris Stirewalt said, Biden got foamed like an under-ripe melon in Super Tuesday. There's going to be more elections tomorrow. And we know that Bernie is not going to do well in those either. So instead, Biden goes to this debate. And what does Bernie do, but pulls him further and further to the left on all sorts of things, like on student loans, etcetera. And I just think that it wasn't necessary. I don't think that the DNC has done themselves any favors. And obviously, it had good viewer-ship, but we are in the middle of a crisis. Like, people aren't going to focus on this. GUTFELD: It felt weird. Kennedy, I -- when Bernie was hammering Joe, and I thought he was doing a powerful job. All Joe was doing was denying it. He kept saying no, I didn't. No, I didn't. And he did on almost everything. It was like a fight in a Walmart parking lot between two seniors over a parking space. KENNEDY: And I know Joe Biden is trying to play defense. But I also think people aren't buying into Bernie Sanders' offense. You know, and he's right to go after Joe Biden on his hypocrisy, because he really is forcing him to do a 180 on some pretty big issues, including foreign policy and criminal justice reform. My biggest issue was with Bernie Sanders saying that we have a dire lack of medical personnel in this country right now. If you think it is bad now, give every doctor and nurse a 40 percent pay cut, and see what your medical personnel looks like in 10 years when no one is going to medical or nursing school because they won't be able to make a decent living. And, you know, I want to go back to what Bernie Sanders also said about big pharmacy. It is the urgency right now that as acting upon these companies and it is the competition they have with each other, in addition to this health crisis, to try and save thousands and potentially millions of lives. And if it is the competition with each other that's going to get us there faster, then I would say that's the best thing that's happening right now and the best thing that will come of this in the future when we're able to fast track other vaccines and biologics for viruses like this. GUTFELD: Hey, Juan, both candidates misidentified the coronavirus as either Ebola or H1N1 or something like that. But who do you think won, the old guy or the other old guy? WILLIAMS: I think it's your old guy. That guy in the White House. I think they're a bunch of 70-year-olds, but I will say this. I thought Biden had a great debate. I mean, I think lots of people, especially -- I don't know -- Dana, I really disagree with you on this idea that he shouldn't have shown up for the debate. If he hadn't showed up for the debate. Lots of people would say oh, you know what, he's afraid. He's like sitting on the ball. He tried to run out the clock. PERINO: He wouldn't last 10 minutes. WILLIAMS: Oh, let me just say. He needed to show up and he needed to demonstrate a strong commanding presence, and he did it last night. I think we should all say, you know what, that was a good debate. First of all, I thought it was a good debate. But secondly, a very good debate for Joe Biden. And then the news coming out of it, I think is partly that he was going left because he wants to win over Bernie Sanders support and I think that's very important. PERINO: I did like it that there was no audience. WILLIAMS: And then finally, I think he said he's going to pick a woman, as his vice president. I think -- PERINO: Why just say he's going to pick the best person. WILLIAMS: Because guess what? GUTFELD: It has to be a woman. WILLIAMS: If the best person had been a woman for all of our history, she wouldn't have been picked, Dana. So it seems to me for him to say, let's get the best person who's a woman and that woman are thoroughly qualified, including Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar -- GUTFELD: Tulsi Gabbard is in. WILLIAMS: Right. Whatever you like, Greg. You can make a suggestion. GUTFELD: No, because those guys -- WILLIAMS: But I'm just saying what -- I mean, that's real -- that's a breakthrough for American women in this day and age, and I think that you got to stop and salute it, especially when you consider the coalition -- PERINO: But do you salute John McCain? WILLIAMS: I'm sorry? KENNEDY: Yes, exactly. Great question. WILLIAMS: Yes, sure. In fact, you know, Sarah Palin is the best. You had -- she was a great performer. But I just wanted to say, his coalition includes suburban white women. Guess what? They will be turned on by that. GUTFELD: Turned on? Really, Juan. WILLIAMS: Yes, yes, yes. GUTFELD: You disgust me. WILLIAMS: I said that for you. GUTFELD: Jesse, last word. WATTERS: I don't even think Biden realized he was committing to picking a woman fifi. He just kind of walked into it and then had to say, oh, yes, that's what I'm going to do. But that's -- I don't care who he picks right now. That's not going to make people vote for him. I have to be honest, and I can't believe I'm agreeing with Juan, but one was right. Joe Biden had a much better debate last night. He's spoken cleaner sound bites, he was much more eloquent, much more in control. He had a much more soothing voice and he only started getting rattled about 45 minutes in and a lot of people after 45 minutes are looking to watch something else. He was easily pushed over to the left by Bernie Sanders. And that's where Bernie started to make some headway that said, Joe, you have not been leading. You've been behind the curve on gay marriage, on the bankruptcy bill, on Hyde, on war on trade. And Biden got very, very defensive and didn't handle that well. But do I think that Bernie landed a knockout punch? Absolutely no. Joe is going to technically win that debate and continue to do well in these next few states. GUTFELD: I think that's a fair assessment. PERINO: Fair. GUTFELD: On that note, up next President Trump telling Americans to stop hoarding supplies. Plus, we'll tell you which Democrat is saying the federal government may have to take over grocery stores. PERINO: What? GUTFELD: Yes. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WILLIAMS: Welcome back. The Coronavirus pandemic is getting worse in America. The widespread fear, anxiety, causing Americans to stockpile food and supplies. Some stores across the country have been completely cleaned out. And companies are struggling to keep up with the demand. President Trump telling nervous Americans, relax. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: There's no need for anybody in the country to hoard essential food supplies. They said to me, could you please tell them just go and buy, enjoy it, have a nice dinner, relax, because there's plenty? But you don't have to -- you don't have to buy the quantities because it's hard to refill the stores on a basis as rapid as refilling them. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: And New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio warning the government may need to get involved if the hoarding continues. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO, D-NYC: The Great Depression and the new deal are very instructive here. I don't -- I'm not saying breadlines, but let's be clear. We're getting close to a reality where the government has to ensure the food supply, that it is not only available, but as equitably distributed. We're going to have to get into a heavy intervention in people's economic lives. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: So Jesse, you know, this is an interesting moment, because you have people who are intent on getting all the toilet paper, all the water, all the hand sanitizer. We had those two brothers out west who not only do they buy it up, but then they were trying to make money by selling it at a high price on Amazon. What would you do? WATTERS: Well, I think you do whatever you can within the law to punish people that are gouging? I don't think you can put a limit on people buying things. But if you watch the mayor, he's almost gleeful with the prospect of having to ration and get heavily involved in the economic lives of the regular American consumer. And when someone like that in power gets happy to be able to do that, that makes me really, really nervous. I went and stockpiled a couple of days ago and I bought more toilet paper than I ever would need. Why did I do that? I don't know. GUTFELD: I do. WATTERS: But I saw -- not for that reason. I just saw this huge thing a toilet paper and I said, I got to get it. And I don't even have room in my apartment to put it. So I have that, I have all this other stuff. I ordered groceries to be delivered to my house today. And it said, the next available grocery delivery date would be Friday. So you know what I had to do? I had to go to the grocery store myself. WILLIAMS: Oh, no. WATTERS: And hand carry out groceries. I don't know what this world's coming to, but to Greg's point earlier at the top of the show, if this is last call tonight in Manhattan with bars at 8:00 or, you know, we're hearing news that liquor stores could be closing soon. GUTFELD: Don't. WATTERS: Go in there. PERINO: No. What? WATTERS: Only deliveries, only delivery. GUTFELD: Oh, I can do that. WATTERS: OK, right, so when you go if it's last call or if you have a last- minute item you need to pick up, give these people a nice fat tip. WILLIAMS: Oh, you're a generous. So Kennedy, I know you stay in shape, and the gyms are now closing. KENNEDY: That's a really good point. And I'm going to go out and run in Central Park. I've got my bike on a wind trainer in my bedroom and that's, you know, through the cold months, that's how I have to train in the winter. That's fine. My concern is my girls. And so we're going to do just dance and yoga and run up and down the hallway and stuff like that because they're normally in a gymnastics gym. And you know, they've got yoga and (INAUDIBLE) and stuff in school. So, you know, like every other parent out there, we're just going to have to get creative. And I will -- if worst comes to worst, I'm going to have to pay them $5.00 for every 100 jumping jacks. WILLIAMS: All right, Dana, did Jasper insist on hoarding anything? PERINO: No, he didn't. He didn't. And I here's the here's the thing. Like, you know, the farmers and the truck drivers and the store owners, they all want to make this work. People are going to be able to work. This is not necessary. I read one of the CEO said, you don't need to buy all of that toilet paper. If you -- because you're not going to use it. If you bought three bags of Doritos, you'll eat those when you really only intended to buy one. So I think that the free market is going to -- you'll see these shelves get back to normal pretty soon. There's no need to be so extremely drastic as De Blasio was talking about. WILLIAMS: You know, Greg, I noticed though that in fact gun sales are going up. And so it makes me think, gee, that's dangerous. That's panicky behavior. I don't know but the government can't say anything because the gun owners have a right. But it just seems like they're ready for, you know, what is that novel, you know, that apocalyptic novel, end of the road, you know? GUTFELD: Yes. It's called The Road. They're obviously want to protect their toilet paper. But people should buy weapons, even in good times and in bad so that -- I'm OK with that. The reason why people are hoarding toilet paper, it's mimetic theory. We desire things according to the desire of others. So when you see some people by X, then more people buy X, and then that creates an escalation as rivals compete. You see this every Black Friday when a group of people are pulling a really crappy shirt because they want the crappy shirt and they don't even know why they want the crappy shirt. So that's what's happening with the toilet paper is that it's pure imitation, psychological imitation. I am so thankful in terms of exercise for Lord Peloton, and all the knights of the Peloton roundtable. PERINO: I love the Peloton. GUTFELD: Ben, and Jenn, and Hannah, and Brody, all the instructors who make me so -- PERINO: Dennis. GUTFELD: Dennis. You can't forget Dennis and his rock ride. Dennis has a great rock ride. Ben does a good Tabata ride that I did this morning. You know what, I should have bought stock in Peloton. PERINO: Who's laughing now? The Peloton wife. GUTFELD: Yes. WILLIAMS: Yes, really. Well, you know, you guys are going to have to make some recommendations to me as to what to watch because I don't have any sports to watch. GUTFELD: Watch Peloton. WILLIAMS: No, thanks. Up next, the head of the DNC and top Democratic Congressman Jim Clyburn attacking President Trump and some of his supporters. That video ahead on THE FIVE. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KENNEDY: Oh, it's getting a little nasty. Top Democrats launching some mad attacks against President Trump and his supporters. DNC chair Tom Perez going after Trump's supporters and voters and questioning their faith. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TOM PEREZ, CHAIRMAN, DNC: I think the challenge that I see among a lot of people that go to Donald Trump rallies and then they will go to church on Sunday, and I'm not -- I don't know what faith they are worshipping. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sure. PEREZ: Donald Trump has done more to hurt the least of us, among us, than just about any president I can think of. (END VIDEO CLIP) KENNEDY: The great theologian, Tom Perez. Top congressional Democrat James Clyburn who is endorsing Joe Biden with this smear against the president. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JAMES CLYBURN, D-S.C.: I do believe this country, this electorate is not definitive in this election. This year, this country could very well go the way of Germany in the 1930s. I really seriously feel that. (END VIDEO CLIP) KENNEDY: Talk about burning down the reg stock. So, Greg, I will start with you. We are in pretty drastic times right now. I think the most drastic measure would not be engaging in this sort of hyper-partisanship. Is that possible for someone like Tom Perez? GUTFELD: I think it's a hard habit to break even in times like these. And it's like, I would hesitate to go after even them because I think it's actually -- I can't believe I'm going to say it -- beneath me. Because I will tell you, there's almost nothing that is beneath me. WATTERS: Greg, it's not. It's not. GUTFELD: Then here's what -- KENNEDY: Turning over to Jesse. GUTFELD: Turning over to Jesse. Yes, Jesse? WATTERS: You know what? Listen. Every time I come on the show, I have things that I write down before I say them so I don't get fired. And sometimes I'll write things down and I'll say like the Nazis or like Hitler or something like that. And then I think to myself, wait, I cannot ever compare anything to Nazi Germany or Hitler. Because every time we do this show, at least once a week we're talking about some idiot on the left, that does that exact same thing. So we don't do that here and I hope other people don't do that. Now for the chairman of a party that promotes partial-birth abortion, that promotes people saying Happy Holidays, instead of Merry Christmas, that has not been very strong with Israel, and that has ObamaCare regulations that like ran the nuns out of town, he should not be going after the religious faith of other people. KENNEDY: It is -- it is belittling, Juan, and it's a very, very slippery slope because when you attack something as personal as someone's religion, and use it to criticize them based on their politics, it really -- it cheapens your position. WILLIAMS: Oh, well, let me do it. Because I think the evangelical -- KENNEDY: You're better than that, Juan. WILLIAMS: The evangelical community in this country knows that there is a great dissonance in terms of their support for President Trump. And they make the case that in fact he delivers for them in terms of right-wing judges who are opposed to abortion, you know, in terms of that support moving the capital Jerusalem in Israel, and all these things, they say, oh, you know what, yes, we know about the three marriages. Yeah, the wall hasn't been built. Yes. The deficits exploding. Yes, we understand about all the troubles in the chaos, but he's our guy. And I think lots of people say, hey, evangelicals, why don't you live up to the principles that you espouse all the time? Why don't you live up to Jesus? Because it wouldn't be with this guy. GUTFELD: But Juan, you're pro-choice. WILLIAMS: What? GUTFELD: You're very religious, yet you're pro-choice. WILLIAMS: I am pro. What does that have to do? GUTFELD: I'm just pointing out the hypocrisy that you have while you were pointing out the hypocrisy of theirs. WILLIAMS: No. I don't think -- what do you mean? Because I'm religious, I can't be pro-choice? GUTFELD: Yes. WILLIAMS: I think that's exactly wrong. GUTFELD: I am saying -- WILLIAMS: I think that -- I don't think that's true at all, Greg. GUTFELD: I do. KENNEDY: I don't think -- I don't think it's up to anyone else -- I don't think it's up to anyone else to dictate to an individual what their faith is, and how their faith and those deep-seated beliefs are somehow to translate to their support for a politician. Dana, last word. We need a voice of wisdom. PERINO: Well, we are in the middle of -- well, not in the middle, we are at the beginning of a very strong testing of our country. We should not question each other's faith. We should not question each other in any way. We should help each other. We should love each other. We should make sure we're helping each other and we make sure that we're doing everything we possibly can to hold this country together. We're going to get through this. But it's terrible that this is happening in an election year. But try to be better. You get a choice every day for what you want to say. And if you want to like win over the other side, maybe not basically call them deplorable. WATTERS: Yes, be best. KENNEDY: Well said. GUTFELD: Be best. KENNEDY: All right, be best and even better than that. ""ONE MORE THING"" is up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PERINO: So it's time now for one more thing. I'll go first. You know, in Italy, they're going through a lot. You might have seen this over the weekend. His name is -- that's tenor Maurizio Marcini. And he was serenade in Florence just to give them a little bit of a lift. And I had him and his wife on the show today. Here's what they had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Music can lift up spirits. And now there are many people who are suffering. He's trying to help them in the way he can. So he's a singer and he sings. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: And the best thing was their little kid jumped out in the middle of it. So I think we'll probably see a lot of this as we all Skype with our guests. And we wish -- we wish Italy the best for sure. Jesse? WATTERS: New segment alert. Jesse's Vacation News. There we go. I wonder what's in that cup. All right, so the coronavirus pandemic is making everybody cancel their vacation plans and their cruises. So a couple from Australia took matters into their own hands. They just did a little cruise in their living room. They threw the robes on, threw some ocean views onto YouTube on their big screen, put their feet up and that's how we like it. You know what they call that? Fake cruise. PERINO: I love it. I love it. Greg? GUTFELD: You know, you didn't listen to the press conference. You're not allowed to be around a tanner. Let's do this. Greg's Attack of the 50 Foot Kitty News. Now I know we're going through some rough periods in our city, but check out this town. Going through some tough times themselves. A giant kitten has been walking over the local highways and trees. PERINO: Scary. GUTFELD: Yes. They had to shut down the highway and it's been going on -- this has been going -- PERINO: He's huge. GUTFELD: This has been going on for three weeks. KENNEDY: You better run if you ever see that. GUTFELD: We can get through this. If that -- if they can survive the kitten, we can survive this. PERINO: We can. All right, Juan. WILLIAMS: All right. So Happy Birthday to my son Tony Williams. It was an unbelievable birthday not only for Tony but for me, because now I'm the father of a 40-year-old man. GUTFELD: Wow. WILLIAMS: Yes. I was 25 when the little guy was born. Take a look. There we are. Here he is at his christening. Here he is as a Presidential Scholar. And here is Mr. Corporate America at the World Series game with his mom and dad and his sister. By the way, she made him a beautiful cake. Here he is hitting the big floral at a dinner Saturday night. PERINO: Gorgeous. WILLIAMS: Happy birthday, Tony. PERINO: Yes. Happy birthday, Tony. And Kennedy, lead us out. KENNEDY: I love that cake. People are trying to cope with their quarantine. One woman invented the quarantini. It's an emergency packet and gin. And that was your drink. Emergen-C said do not mix our product with alcohol. One gin company said no, it actually sounds like a good idea if you're healthy. I don't know how you're coping with the crisis, but for many, they have become amateur mixologists. I don't know. What is your choice -- drink of choice during coronavirus, Greg? GUTFELD: Booze. KENNEDY: Any kind? GUTFELD: Anything that's within six feet of me. PERINO: And not 10 people ore more. GUTFELD: Yes. PERINO: All right, set your DVRs. Never miss an episode of ""The Five.""

This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" March 13, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Juan Williams along with Dr. Nicole Saphier, Jesse Watters, Shannon Bream, and Gregory Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City. And this is The Five.  President Trump declaring a national emergency over the Coronavirus. There are now more than 1600 cases and 41 deaths in the United States. Here's the President.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: To unleash the full power of the federal government to this effort today, I am officially declaring a national emergency. As a result of that action today, we are announcing a new partnership with private sector to vastly increase and accelerate our capacity to test for the Coronavirus.  We want to make sure that those who need a test can get a test very safely, quickly, and conveniently. The next eight weeks are critical. We can learn and we will turn a corner on this virus. Some of the doctors say it will wash through. It will flow through. Interesting terms. And very accurate. I have thought you are going to find, in a number of weeks, it's going to be a very accurate term.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: The President's declaration of a national emergency, a lot of pressure coming from opposite directions, but did he it. Jesse, what do you make of it?  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: It's not so much what he says, it's what he does. And when you unleash $50 billion, it's going to do a lot. The markets loved it. You know, everybody was criticizing him when he spoke on Wednesday, and the markets went down. And now he speaks, and the markets go up.  So it's really about action more than anything. He has unleashed the private sector. A lot of people were expecting that when you bring in Roche and Google, and you start ramping up testing, even drive-through testing which we have seen in South Korea and people are very excited about that.  So, if you really unlock the resources with the hospitals and the medical industry, people are going to be feeling a lot more confident. Now, Nancy Pelosi needs to get her act together. I don't know what she is waiting for. They need to come together and get the tax cut with the payroll deal done. Along with worker relief and paid leave. That should happen now. I don't know what's taking them that long. And on Monday, the markets will respond to that very strongly.  The President said he's going to get tested. That was big news item right there. And I think we will await his results because allegedly, he has been in contact with people that have tested positive, standing next to them, taking pictures with them. And if he tests negative, a man of his age, it kind of gives you an indication about the contagion aspect.  WILLIAMS: OK. Hold on, because we have some tape of that.  WATTERS: OK.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you being selfish by not getting tested and --  TRUMP: I didn't say I wasn't going to be tested.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you going to be?  TRUMP: Most likely, yeah, most likely. Not for that reason but because I think I will do it anyway.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Will you let us know the results?  TRUMP: Fairly soon. We are working on that. We are working out a schedule.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: So, what do you say, Shannon?  SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: I don't think he will want to get a test right now for a number of reasons, including which people are going to say, oh, President can get a test and no one else can get a test. You know some people are going to use that as a talking point, if he is like oh, I had a test eight days ago. So we will see.  Bret Baier pointed out earlier it could be a test that rolls out when the whole testing kit. Look, I will be one of the ones to take it, but now, everyone will get the test. Maybe a tie-in there. One of the things that made me really sad today though, there was a lot of good news was this thing about nursing homes and you can't go visit.  WATTERS: Yeah.  BREAM: Old people are my tribe, I love it. And I like to hang out in nursing homes. I do. People need to be cheered up.  WATTERS: Do you love to hang out?  BREAM: I do. I love it. When I was a little kid, we would go every Sunday after church. And my mom would take her ukulele. And I would stand on the table and we would sing songs.  GUTFELD: Why would you torture these people?  BREAM: I'm not saying it was good. But they were lonely and hard of hearing.  GUTFELD: Yeah, that's good.  BREAM: So, I think my singing was OK. But I feel like we should all adopt a nursing home in communities. And have school kids who have school kids have free time now to write letters to the nursing homes, and to flood them with kindness.  GUTFELD: But don't go.  BREAM: No, no, no. But I feel you can send letters, you can send cards and things over.  NICOLE SAPHIER, FOX NEWS HOST: Absolutely.  BREAM: Because people are going to be so lonely. And they need human contact. So I say we adopt nursing homes.  WILLIAMS: So, Greg.  BREAM: That's my stand.  WILLIAMS: I'm struck by just what Shannon is talking about because one of the constant points of criticism is the shortage of testing. And, of course, the President is now saying he is -- they are making an effort. I think he even have the guy from Wal-Mart there and use the parking lots for drive-through testing?  GUTFELD: Right.  WILLIAMS: What do you make of this?  GUTFELD: Well, you know, when we think about 9/11, a lot of things that took place ended up being permanent. A lot of people are still taking off their shoes. Some things you want to be permanent. For example, if there are innovations in testing and telemedicine, I want those things to be permanent. I want to use a situation to create things where can you drive- through and get a test for anything.  I am really though -- I'm really pleasantly surprised how the media cares about his health, you know what I mean. First, they wanted him out because he is insane. Now, they want him to remain alive. I also like the fact that he fielded questions unlike Bernie and Biden. But it's good.  What you are seeing is very similar to what happened in World War II. Companies joining together to fight, and it demonstrates a lot of stuff is going on that is really positive. And one of the good signs about this is the number one complaint that I noticed in the media on Twitter, lack of diversity.  So that's your complaint. Things are pretty good if you are mad that they were all the wrong color.  WATTERS: What about Ambassador Birx. She is a female. That's pretty different.  GUTFELD: But she is white, Jesse.  WILLIAMS: Oh, OK.  GUTFELD: Come on.  WATTERS: Think of diversity.  GUTFELD: Forget about their impressive skills, you know.  WILLIAMS: Boy, you guys are -- you guys have some preoccupation. I think you should check out the surgeon general some time. He is a man of color.  GUTFELD: I'm talking about the people on Twitter, not me.  WILLIAMS: OK. Dr. Saphier, I was -- you know, the whole idea that the problem could continue was expressed by Dr. Fauci today. He said this could be not a matter of weeks, but a matter of months. And I was struck by this. He said eight weeks looks like what is realistic prediction to him.  SAPHIER: I think actually he has said several different things. He said four to five weeks until things start calming down. We may hit equilibrium, which I do think that is realistic it. But it could be shorter than that, probably not. It could be longer than that.  But the point is we are taking the effective measures to do what we can to slow the spread and get things under control. I think this was a very important presser today. It went on much longer than I expected. They took a lot of questions, which was the right thing to do because transparency is going to help.  We saw the stock market respond right away. And I am not necessarily -- I know it's because $50 billion has now been levied, but also what happened. He brought all of the private sector, which is exactly where we should have been to be honest earlier. And I'm a little disappointed in them at this point. And I'm going to continue to tell them that.  They should have stepped up. I depend on them. I promote capitalism every day because I expect more from them. So I'm glad they are here now. I think this is why the stock market responded. And I'm absolutely optimistic that we are going to start seeing more tests. And we're going to start getting this under control.  GUTFELD: To your point, too, it's actually good news, it doesn't sound like it. But when you say it's lasting longer, it's because you are spreading out the burden. This is a case where you don't want to rip the Band-Aid off because you aren't prepared for what's underneath that Band-Aid, if you are in the hospital.  When they say it's going to be -- I mean, optimistically if it's three months long that means they have pushed that -- what do they call that? Flatten the curve.  SAPHIER: Let me tell you -- also let me tell you why that's very important to do. It does seem like we are elongating the process. And that's OK, because we're still on flu season. Flu tends to burden our hospitals. So we want to elongate this. So we can actually get out of flu season a little bit, and still be able to care for all patients.  GUTFELD: Right.  SAPHIER: We don't want to be burdened. We don't want to have makeshift hospitals out of hotel rooms.  GUTFELD: Care.  SAPHIER: Exactly. That's what is happening in Italy right now.  GUTFELD: Yeah.  SAPHIER: With respirators.  WILLIAMS: So, Jesse, going around town, I'm a little struck here in Midtown Manhattan restaurants. My favorite restaurant is closing for two weeks. You go into some of the retail stores. And the store owners look like they are...  GUTFELD: Juan, they were lying to you. I was just there.  WATTERS: You have to have a reservation. I will take care of it for you. It's like you get up here, there is no traffic. A lot of places are empty. And that's fine. That will last for a very short period of time.  But I do I want to talk to you about the CDC. I didn't know this. A lot of the CDC criticism I believe was justified because they weren't ratcheting up these test kits, apparently fast enough. Dr. Fauci explained that the CDC was not designed for a nationwide testing operation. It was never designed like that.  Those systems were not in place any administration. So the fact they were able to do this with the private sector that quickly speaks to how resilient these people have been.  WILLIAMS: I think the concern was they didn't anticipate and make the preparations. And I think everybody agrees. There was a problem with the testing.  WATTERS: You can't do it overnight. And hopefully, they have it together now.  WILLIAMS: Exactly. The President said previously national emergency unnecessary. Today, he changed his mind.  WATTERS: Flexible leadership.  WILLIAMS: Way to go. Way to go, Jesse. Hang in there, buddy.  Straight ahead, more from President Trump after his declaration of a national emergency over the Coronavirus, how he is responding to criticism from the Democrats. That's next, right here on The Five.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WATTERS: President Trump declaring a national emergency over the Coronavirus pandemic. The President responding to Democrats who have been attacking him.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: We don't think the Democrats are giving enough. We are negotiating. We thought we had something, but all of a sudden, they didn't agree to certain things that they agreed to. So, we could have something, but we don't think they are giving enough. They're not -- they're not doing what's right for the country.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: Meanwhile China now blaming America for the spread of the Coronavirus across the world. A Chinese official taking to Twitter to push a bogus conspiracy theory claiming that the U.S. Army brought the virus to China. Here's the President sounding off on that.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: I did read one article, but I don't think that article was representative, certainly not in my conversations with President Xi. And they know where it came from. We all know where it came from.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: And it looks like the State Department just summoned the Ambassador to China and gave him a little tongue lashing about some of these things that's come out of the country's foreign ministry, about America starting the virus in Wuhan.  BREAM: Listen, we all think that's Cuckoo Town, I think we agree. What upsets me about China though is these threats they're saying now.  WATTERS: Yeah.  BREAM: About we control all kinds of supply chains. It's really an exposed problem. If you want to have bipartisan action over anything, do it over this. The fact that we have so much outsource to China in pharmaceuticals and the agents we need for testing and all kinds of things. But the fact that they are now openly threatening us like we can shut this down. And you would be in the stew of the Wuhan virus as they are calling it.  WILLIAMS: Wow.  BREAM: I think China has got to settle.  WATTERS: Yeah, it looks like 90 percent of the ingredients in pharmaceuticals come from China. And now, they are threatening to I guess slap export controls during the height of this thing, Greg, not good.  GUTFELD: And also, you can't forget that the illegal drug that is killing most people in the opioid epidemic is fentanyl. People are mistaking it -- they think it's the prescription drugs. It's the fentanyl also in street Xanax and street heroin. The fentanyl makes it powerful and you can -- you can cut it with that stuff and then you people die.  But who was -- who was ahead of the curve on all of this? It was Trump.  WATTERS: Yeah.  GUTFELD: Trump was -- I mean, I remember we were giggling or maybe it was just me when he was talking about China all the time, when he was running for President. And I -- he pretty much called this.  WATTERS: He did predict a lot of this. Now, I think Marco Rubio had some thoughts about maybe not being so reliant on China. Let's listen to that.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  REP. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL): We are dangerously reliant particularly on China for the production of critical goods. And that includes goods that I have already outlined that are needed to fight the Coronavirus. And I think we rely on far more goods than we know.  The absence of having these domestic businesses that can ramp up production to meet demands for these critical goods limits our ability to mitigate, the worst effects of this virus.  The result is that the virus could end up being more damaging than it needed to be.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: And, Juan, don't you think Democrats and Republicans can get together on make Made in America?  WILLIAMS: Yeah, I think senator Rubio is exactly right. We are overly dependent on the Chinese in this regard. And it is startling to me that we haven't dealt with it before. In fact, you know, we are complicit because, obviously, a lot of businesses find it cheaper.  GUTFELD: We like their stuff.  WILLIAMS: They make the goods there, and them bring it back rather than rely on Americans. I would prefer to rely on Americans. At the same time, if you are in to pure capitalism and you want to see stock market go up, that's how it works.  But, my concern here is I don't think there is any question it originated in Wuhan, China. I mean, I don't -- I don't understand what the conspiracy theory is about. But, on the other hand, I don't think that because it originated, there is any reason then to think the worse of Chinese people or even the Chinese government, which I think lies occasionally, but, the problem is that we live in a global world, just as suggested by the economic facts of reality.  And we have to deal with the reality on the ground here in the United States right now. It doesn't help us in terms of the international alliances that are possible to start cutting off people. We angered the Europeans earlier this week, angered the Chinese. At what point, do you say hey, look, calm down, let's as a world community deal with this issue.  WATTERS: Well, I mean, one of the reasons they are angry because we slapped a travel ban on them. So I would rather them be angry than us dead.  WILLIAMS: But they wanted to be informed. They said they weren't told. And they are our allies.  WATTERS: Well, I think Trump informed them, .but maybe not soon enough for them to get their act together. Dr. Nicole Saphier, how do you see this Chinese situation right now?  SAPHIER: I think this is extremely concerning. And I talked about this a while ago about our dependency on pharmaceutical prices -- pharmaceutical supplies, not just from China, but from everywhere in the world, from India and a lot of these regions in Germany now.  Again, I want to stay away from bad China, even though they are acting a little bad right now. It's a bigger problem than that. And if we want to bring manufacturing to the United States, that's a great thing. I love the idea the majority of the research is done here. We put in the hard work, so why not benefit from it?  However, in the era when we have rising drug prices, are we really going to take manufacturing from somewhere where it costs significantly less to actually manufacture and bring it here? And the answer should be yes. But I would like to know how to do it. And I'm a doctor. I don't know how to do it. I just want to make that all of my patients are able to get their medications.  And right now, I'm concerned as I see this tit-for-tat between the Chinese government and us now that these patients are not going to be able to get it. That is absolutely concerning.  WILLIAMS: Maybe you could get Greg to give you some advice because the illegal drug makers on American streets seem to know what's up.  GUTFELD: They know what they are doing. We have to decouple. I think that's the word, correct?  WILLIAMS: Yes.  GUTFELD: I'm not even sure what it means.  SAPHIER: Conscious uncoupling.  GUTFELD: Just break it off.  WATTERS: Gwyneth Paltrow.  GUTFELD: Do it in a public restaurant, so China doesn't throw a fit.  SAPHIER: Throw the ring back?  GUTFELD: Look, we're going into two different directions.  WATTERS: It's you.  GUTFELD: Yeah.  WATTERS: All right. We will have more on the Coronavirus later.  But, next, sleepy Joe Biden's campaign is facing a very big problem. It could cripple his chances at winning the White House.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  SAPHIER: All right. Joe Biden's campaign has been riding high after key Super Tuesday victories. But he could soon face a major problem that plagued Hillary Clinton. Politico reporting a never-Biden movement is growing, quote, in Michigan, a state critical to Democrats efforts to reclaim their general election footing, two of five Sanders' backers said, they would vote Democratic in November, regardless of who became the nominee.  And making matters worse, Congressman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is now blaming voter suppression for the reason why Sanders lost so big in Michigan. Take a listen.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): I think one thing that we -- that isn't being talked about is the rampant voter suppression in this country. Right there in Ann Arbor where we had that rally, those kids were waiting three hours in line to vote in Michigan. And so, when we talk about who is turning out and who is not turning out.  BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: So, just to be clear, you are saying that you think voters didn't get to vote who wanted to vote in Michigan?  OCASIO-CORTEZ: Absolutely.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  SAPHIER: Well, Greg, you know these younger generations just don't have the patience for anything anymore. What do you think? Do you buy what AOC is saying?  GUTFELD: Oh, my God. I can't believe it. No. She is wrong. It's not voter suppression. It's voter depression. Because when you look at what the Democrats have to offer, you want to throw yourself off a bridge. It's got to be hard, if you are a Democrat, if you're like Juan look at this field four years to prepare and you have the two old white guys, the two oldest whitest guys from the municipalities up there Muppets up there. And this is from the party that accuses all us of being intolerant and lacking diversity, and being bigoted. And then, when they have the choice, they pick the two oldest whitest guys.  SAPHIER: Well, thank you.  GUTFELD: Anyway.  SAPHIER: All right. Juan, moving on. Juan.  WILLIAMS: Are you OK? Are you all right?  GUTFELD: I'm just confused. I feel bad for the Bernie supporters in a way. And I think they should vote for Trump.  WILLIAMS: That's it? Another old -- oh, I wasn't.  GUTFELD: Only 73.  WILLIAMS: But here's the thing about what she just said. Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez is a little off. So she is saying even if these young people are waiting in line, she assumed they were all going to vote for one guy, Bernie Sanders? I think the voting showed that a lot of them might have been voting for Joe Biden.  This is not voter suppression. This is something quite different. You can say the lines are too long, but that's not what's going on. I think -- but I will say this with regard to the larger point. In Michigan, you get 80 percent of Sanders' voters saying we would be dissatisfied with Biden.  But, the reality is the number one priority across the nation, Dr. Saphier, for all Democrats is beating Donald Trump. So, when you come down to that moment, I think it's getting to be pretty clear. And I think a lot of people who may be temporarily, you know, boy, I wish it was Bernie Sanders are going to say well, you know what, by November, I'm remembering what this is about.  WATTERS: Well, my math is not perfect, but I think it's actually 60 percent of Bernie backers say they wouldn't vote for Joe Biden. That's the problem. This is going to be base versus base.  SAPHIER: I thought it was 80 percent. I thought it was 80 percent  WILLIAMS: That's what I thought.  WATTERS: Two for five, you extrapolate.  WILLIAMS: No, no, that's the 40 percent.  WATTERS: Two of five.  SAPHIER: No, no, no. Those are two different polls, 40 percent said they would vote Democrat no matter what. What that's two in five. But 80 percent -- which is different question now, 80 percent of those voters, four of five, not of the same five, just different five, are saying they are dissatisfied with Biden.  WATTERS: Either way, we don't need to bore the audience for the percentages. The point is a significant chunk of Sanders' supporters say they are not satisfied with sleepy.  SAPHIER: And they don't like him.  WATTERS: And that means Trump goes into the election with a much stronger base because Biden not only does he not get the Bernie win, he can't electrify Democrats on November to come out to knock on doors, to raise money, and to wait three hours in the polls. So that's going to be a problem.  The other thing is Biden can't undiplomatically put away Bernie on Sunday during the debate. He needs Bernie later. So if he like loses his cool like he did with that voter in Michigan, that's going to really rub a lot of Bernie bros the long way. So Biden puts him down, he's to put him down gently.  SAPHIER: That is interesting. Shannon, we know...  WATTERS: It is interesting, isn't it?  SAPHIER: Like everything Jesse says.  WILLIAMS: I think she insulted you.  SAPHIER: It is, Jesse, but you have such inflection you can say anything at this point and I would be like oh, yeah.  WATTERS: I could, couldn't I?  GUTFELD: You are right.  SAPHIER: I got it, I got it. So, Shannon, moving on, my question for you is talking about primaries, they are very different than the general election.  BREAM: Yeah.  SAPHIER: So, although we see Biden having some victories although there is a never-Biden #happening...  BREAM: Right.  SAPHIER: How do you think he will fare against Trump?  BREAM: Well, once you actually have the head-to-head matchup, like you will see on Sunday when you have Biden and Bernie, when it's down to the final two, everything changes, the way the PACs, the way the Trump campaign will spend, the ads that they will run. And plus, it's going to be like the Bloomberg phenomenon I think in some ways, where he is untested before he gets to the debate stage, everybody loves him, thinks he is going to be the savior of the whole primary. When he gets there and kind of fizzles and doesn't work, I mean, you just don't know.  When Biden and Trump get on the stage together, you will see who rises, who fizzles, what happens. When they're head-to-head, it's much different. The polling is much different. The ads are much different. It all changes when you are out of the primary and now, finally one-on-one.  But I will say about to the Bernie bros, I've told the story before. But when I was on the DNC covering it on the floor last time, they were so angry at the DNC and Hillary Clinton, they came to find me. They saw the Fox microphone and said, we are going to vote for Trump.  WATTERS: Yeah.  BREAM: So, whether they stay home, maybe they don't go that far, but if they're unmotivated then stay home. That impacts the vote, too.  WILLIAMS: Well, I would just say, one thing that we have learned and you would know a lot about this given what do with voter analysis for Fox News is that Biden is building a different kind of coalition. And he is bringing out people beyond the young voters, and they don't always vote.  But what Biden is doing is not only black voters, not only some of the union folks, but you also get now some of the suburban white moderates, especially the women were turning out in bigger numbers. We saw this and the suburbs out in Michigan suburbs of Detroit. They had record numbers --  BREAM: But also interesting to see to the president who is unopposed, is getting record numbers of people to show up and vote primaries where he's not facing anyone. I mean, there's -- it's interesting.  SAPHIER: We do have to watch what's going to happen because Louisiana just postpone their primary. So is this going to be a trickle effect? Will we even have primaries. And talk about voter suppression, will they even be able to vote in a primary? I'm curious --  WILLIAMS: You mean, because of coronavirus.  SAPHIER: Because of coronavirus. I'm just curious to see how this is going to play out.  WATTERS: Well, Greg had to cancel his show and send everybody home. Everybody was waiting to see him.  GUTFELD: Yes. And don't mention --  BREAM: Postpone.  GUTFELD: Don't mention trickle effect around Biden, OK.  WILLIAMS: You think they might cancel the November election if Trump --  SAPHIER: They absolutely should not. This should not interfere with our elections.  BREAM: Put your masks on and go vote.  SAPHIER: Speaking of coronavirus, President Trump just declaring a national emergency to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. What every American needs to know coming up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: The spirit and the will of our nation is unbreakable. We will defeat this threat. When America's tested, America rises to the occasion. With faith and heart and hope and love and determination, we will succeed, we will prevail, we will be very, very successful and we'll learn for the future.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  BREAM: Welcome back. That was President Trump earlier declaring a national emergency over the COVID-19 pandemic. Around the country in New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio wrapping up a news conference about how America's largest city is now handling the outbreak. Illinois announcing it is closing all schools starting next Tuesday until March 30th. Kentucky declaring a state of emergency and also shutting down schools for at least two weeks. And the governor of South Carolina declaring a state of emergency as well.  You can see and feel there's fear and anxiety out there, running high over the spread of the virus. So calm down. We have Dr. Nicole Saphier here and also Let's welcome Dr. Marc Siegel to answer some key questions. Great to have you both.  MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Great to be here.  BREAM: All right, Dr. Siegel, I'll start with you. This idea that people will have more widespread testing, people are concerned, now, we're being told if you really think there's possibility you have this, call your doctor first. Don't just show up in the E.R. How should this work if you suspect or you're worried and want to get tested?  SIEGEL: Well, that's key. Because if you show up in the E.R., you present a problem to the E.R. If they think you might have coronavirus, then they have to put you in a unit with other people with cough, shortness of breath, and fever, and you could actually be spreading it.  And about the -- as Nicole has pointed out, how about the healthcare workers that are -- that are then exposed to it. So that's a major problem. I think the bigger problem though is I want to get these phone calls, and I've been told by my -- by my medical center not to see patients in my office with the symptom, but I still can't get the tests.  And it suddenly occurred to me that one of the reasons I can't get the test is that people don't want to do them. A lab tech isn't going to want to put that specimen deep into someone's nostril because that can expose them to coronavirus. We have to coordinate this so the tests are out there, that the labs are doing them, and that they -- we actually get the results so we can rule out coronavirus in a lot of people and the ones that have it, we can separate it. We have no ideas of the numbers really.  BREAM: Yes, I mean, how's the drive-through thing going to work? I mean, we talked about -- you talked about in South Korea, it's been such a helpful thing or in Japan. You know, they're talking about rolling it out here too.  SAPHIER: I think in this specific situation, in the acute situation, the right thing to do are these drive through -- drive -- these -- so you can get tested because we want to be able to test a lot of people. That is the whole point. If we know who's infected, then we can not only quarantine them, but then we quickly figure out who their contacts are and separate them as well. And that's how we're going to contain this community -- the spread of disease.  However, I want to be sure that I say this is not the future of America testing. Because the truth is, I don't want people to think that your flu test or your strep test, this is how it should be done, because this is not good health care. This is in a crisis situation for a pandemic. We want to mass test patients. And that's the only reason we're considering doing this right now, because we don't know a ton about the virus.  But what we do know is highly contagious, and people are spreading it even with mild symptoms. So we want to keep people as secluded as possible. So by just swabbing them in the comfort of their own car, you are now not letting them infect anybody else, and the only person coming in contact with them is the person swabbing them, and they're wearing full hazmat suits.  SIEGEL: Perfect. This worked in South Korea, by the way, just what you just said. It's working in South Korea.  GUTFELD: All right, I have three questions. Why are important people getting tested fast, like athletes, actors and actresses, politicians, and everybody else is having a hard time? Is there different rules for people with money and influence?  WILLIAMS: In America?  GUTFELD: Yes, I know. Surprised? Number two, we hear about the ventilator shortage. Is private industry going to be stepping up and making different or cheaper ventilators? And number three, Cuomo today was talking about how people are largely having pneumonia. So can you just treat this thing like it's pneumonia? Those are my three questions. You can start with whichever one you want.  SAPHIER: Well, OK, I'll tackle them pneumonia question. So refer to this as a pneumonia. And the truth is, it starts as -- the coronavirus tends to be just an upper respiratory infection. Meaning it's kind of just up here, which is like the common cold.  GUTFELD: Right.  SAPHIER: What's happening with some people, those who get severe illness with this, it's going from upper respiratory to lower respiratory, and then what happens is it affects the lungs. And so it does cause a viral pneumonia. And then what we're seeing on imaging like CT scans is a very specific pattern for something we call ARDS. And that is actually not necessarily just infection in your lungs, but you actually have fluids seeping out of the vessels in your lungs and it's like an overreaction of the body's immune response that's attacking the lungs.  So yes, there's a viral pneumonia component to this. But this is not the same as what you see, like a bacteria -- a secondary bacterial pneumonia that you get with the flu. It's very different.  SIEGEL: The pneumonia shot is not going to help you.  GUTFELD: I'm just curious. Now, what about --  WATTERS: Is this like a White House briefing? You get three questions? I follow and I follow up?  SIEGEL: I can't remember.  GUTFELD: How does an NBC player get a test, but I can't. Is it because I'm short?  BREAM: Well, you know what --  GUTFELD: Is it all about height?  BREAM: Only tall people can get test.  SIEGEL: Listen, I got to tell you, I've been trying for the last few days to get rich, famous celebrity patients this time, and I cannot. The only way you can get this test is through the state and city health department.  GUTFELD: All right, what about ventilator?  SIEGEL: Then you have to prove that you have symptoms. It's, it's a monster.  SAPHIER: It is -- and that's -- it is a big issue that I'm not even going to try to tackle here. I know at my hospital, we have a lot of immunocompromised patients and I know that we have tests for them, but they are a very vulnerable population, so that's all I can say. I can attest to those that are getting it outside of that.  BREAM: Ventilator.  SIEGEL: And in Nebraska, by the way, they testing a six-hour test. Cleveland Clinic is getting eight-hour test. NYU was starting our testing Monday. So the medical centers are finally saying we better -- we better get into it. And Sloan Kettering has been doing it for a while now.  WILLIAMS: So I have a question.  BREAM: Wait, ventilator.  (CROSSTALK)  SAPHIER: Because that's a big question. A lot of people are concerned about this, because actually what's going on in Italy right now is they don't have ventilators for the people. It's important to point out in the Lombardy region, which seems to be the kind of the center there, that I believe from what I've heard that that has a large elderly population, and we know that this affects elderly more. The people who are presenting with severe disease, 10 percent of them are having to be ventilated.  That does not seem like the general ventilation rate. It's just in that specific area. We're not seeing that number elsewhere. However, what they are experiencing is they don't have enough and they are actually having to decide who gets the ventilator and who doesn't.  In the United States, we have more. We have more doctors and hospital beds and ventilators per person than a lot of places in Europe do. But we still don't have enough especially as we have had seen hospitals close with all the consolidations in the last decade, as well as we're having physician shortages too, because of burnout.  SIEGEL: We have 200,000 ventilators as Nicole is saying. But what's going to happen is a lot of them are spoken for already.  GUTFELD: Wow. I got to make my own.  (CROSSTALK)  SAPHIER: They're actually ordering more and manufacturing more, so we did address that.  WILLIAMS: Yes. But I mean, we're worried about the hospitals just being overburdened in general including -- in terms of staff.  SAPHIER: Yes, we do.  WILLIAMS: So the question I had was this. I hear from the President and others say, well, it's just a lot like the flu, but then I hear from Dr. Fauci, and he says 10 times worse than the flu. So I've got two doctors here.  SIEGEL: Let me weigh in on this carefully because I never disagree with Dr. Fauci and he's a mentor of mine. But on this case, I want to say that there's a lot of -- a lot of mild cases out there that are not diagnosed. We don't have the test kits. As the virus evolves and becomes more used to humans, it gets milder usually over time. It's more deadly at the beginning and there's a lot of asymptomatic cases.  In South Korea, the death rate is 0.7 percent. The death rate of the flow is 0.1 percent. So I think that's what he meant that it's more than the flu, but it's still way less than we're being told.  SAPHIER: And we have to remember, the South Korea death rate is likely going to be more accurate because they tested the most amount of people. So that seems -- whereas in China, there was a large amount of the population not tested. So we -- their number is likely overestimated.  BREAM: All right, Jesse.  WATTERS: I have three quick questions.  BREAM: No, no, no. We don't have time.  WATTERS: When you wash your hands --  SIEGEL: And you're not that short.  WATTERS: When you wash your hands, does it have to be warm water? Can it be cold water because the faucets at Fox, it's all cold?  WILLIAMS: Wait a minute, they're all cold. Fox faucets are not cold.  WATTERS: Yes, I admit, you can adjust it. We're on the same floor, Juan.  WILLIAMS: Yes, I got hot water.  GUTFELD: And also, what's the point of washing your hands when you got to leave the bathroom with the door handles. Fox --  BREAM: No, no, you take your --  (CROSSTALK)  BREAM: And by the way, paper towel to get out.  SIEGEL: Use moisturizing cream, by the way. If you dry out your hands --  WATTERS: Moisturizing cream.  SAPHIER: Jesse, Dagen McDowell has very similar complaints to you about the cold water in the faucets, but -- so I did research this at her request and it's fine. It doesn't matter.  WATTERS: When you're in an Uber, we advise just cracking the window a little bit. Yes, right?  SIEGER: Yes, yes, fresh air, especially in an Uber. Who knows who's been there before?  GUTFELD: By the way, the water in the urinals is cold too.  BREAM: OK, thanks everybody. Dr. Siegel, thank you very much. ""FAN MAIL FRIDAY"" up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: Wow, classic ""FAN MAIL FRIDAY."" We're answering your questions because we care. First one, from Tom Sullivan, whatever. When you were growing up -- this is actually an interesting question. When you're growing up, what was your parents favorite musician/band, Shannon? This will say something about --  BREAM: This will tell you a lot about me. We watched the Lawrence Welk Show.  GUTFELD: Oh my god. That's what my grandmother used to watch.  BREAM: Yes. We did it with my grandparents.  GUTFELD: And Hee Haw.  BREAM: We would watch it. And Hee Haw -- don't make me sing the Hee Haw song because I know every word.  GUTFELD: You have to do it now.  BREAM: We're now once go around spread rumors. I'm not going to sing the whole thing. You know, I love this song. Yes.  GUTFELD: I'm so glad I ask.  WILLIAMS: Maybe you get her to bring her ukulele.  GUTFELD: What about you, Doc?  SAPHIER: Linda Ronstadt, Bonnie Raitt, Jackson Browne, Carlos Simon. I was raised by hippies.  GUTFELD: Yes, that is definitely hippy stuff.  BREAM: Good stuff. I like it.  GUTFELD: Juan?  WILLIAMS: You know, Harry Belafonte, Nat King Cole. They were very into salsa so -- but I don't even remember the names of all those Latin musicians.  SAPHIER: Will you demonstrate the salsa.  WILLIAMS: No. Next time Shannon is available.  SAPHIER: Why not?  GUTFELD: Jesse can set up everything he needs. Jesse, what do your parents listen to? Are they hippies?  WATTERS: Yes, protests rock. CCR and all that stuff.  GUTFELD: Yes. My mom was a Tom Jones fanatic. She actually worked as an usher at the circle star theater in Belmont so she could get a free ticket. It's so sad when I think about it. She was like -- she was like in her 30s already and she had to that. she volunteered to be an extra so she could watch Tom Jones.  BREAM: I love it.  GUTFELD: You know, they used to throw -- women would throw their underwear out of them.  BREAM: I've heard. I've heard.  GUTFELD: Yes. And the underwear back then was really weird. All right, from Mike.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: What is the most fun you've ever had on T.V., Jesse?  WATTERS: Wow. Well, we had to edit out a lot of ""WATTERS WORLD."" Those will never going to see the light of day. But no, I have a lot of fun on the show, mostly during the feeding frenzies, or when you say something crazy, or when Dana can't stop laughing, that's good stuff.  GUTFELD: What about you, Juan?  WILLIAMS: Actually, Jessie and I had fun the other day we went to the Super Bowl, right?  WATTERS: That's right. No, wait, Juan, the night before the super.  WILLIAMS: Oh, that was -- no, but I'm talking -- no, I'm talking about --  GUTFELD: If he doesn't remember, it was great.  WILLIAMS: -- an NFL combine --  WATTERS: Oh, yes. That was a lot of fun.  WILLIAMS: When we were running around and throwing the football.  WATTERS: Juan got speed.  WILLIAMS: No, that was great. And then you're right. We had -- but that wasn't on T.V.  WATTERS: It a late night. It's a long night.  WILLIAMS: That was a good night.  GUTFELD: Shannon?  BREAM: We have this thing on Friday nights on the 11:00 p.m. show called Night Court where we have crazy court cases. And we had one a couple weeks ago. There was a guy who had challenged his ex-wife's attorney to a duel under a super ancient law that was still on the books. And I was trying to get through the story and I could not stop laughing because we had video which was not related to the story of a woman with a samurai sword. And it was one of those photos. And I couldn't get through it because --  GUTFELD: Samurai stock photos. Doc, what's the most fun you had on T.V.? I know you spent most of the time in the hospital, so --  SAPHIER: Just right here. Just this laughing. I mean, this is fun because you know, my day job is a bit -- you know, I give a lot of bad news. And so when I'm doing this, it's exhilarating, it's fun, and I love the people I work with.  WATTERS: Tell them about the fingertip washing. When you're washing your hands --  BREAM: Oh, yes.  WATTERS: It's not about this. Get the fingertips.  SAPHIER: I mean, most people tend to just focus on their palms. You have to really get those fingertips. That's why you touch everything, and thumbs.  GUTFELD: My fun is odd guest combinations on Red Eye. I like having Father Jonathan and Oderus Urungus from Gwar on the same show.  WATTERS: You were in the --  GUTFELD: Yes. And Ann Coulter with King Buzzo from the Melvins. We would have the strangest combinations. It was like being that Star Wars bar, but slightly weirder and smellier. ""ONE MORE THING"" is up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WILLIAMS: It's time for ""ONE MORE THING"" on this fun Friday. I'm going to go first. I'm going to ask you a question. Who is your favorite superhero? A new poll done to celebrate the opening of Disney's California Adventure Park Avengers Exhibit asked people to rate their favorite superheroes and villains.  2,000 people, here are the results. Number five, Iron Man. Number four, Captain America. Number three, Batman. Number two, Spiderman, my favorite. And number one, not Jesse, Superman. By the way, the Joker and Catwoman top the list of villains. And ladies, good news, Wonder Woman came in number six among top superheroes. Greg?  GUTFELD: What a shocking lack of diversity.  WILLIAMS: Oh, no, no. In fact, I didn't -- I didn't say it, but Black Panther, Black Panther is number nine.  GUTFELD: No Asians? All right, so the ""GREG GUTFELD SHOW,"" yes, we're going to be on tomorrow night, you could bet, 10:00 p.m. We got Dagen McDowell, Rob Long, Kat Timpf, Mike Baker. That's Saturday, March 14th, 10:00 p.m. And it is a great show. We take it all apart. Now it's time for this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Animals are great. Animals are great. Animals are great.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: This is very, very short tape, but it's just really cute when you see -- when you see a groundhog forget, suddenly remember something he forgot. Do that one more. It's like he just remembered where you put the car keys. That's me every morning when I close the door and I realized that I'm not wearing pants. There you go. That's it for me.  WILLIAMS: All right, Jesse.  WATTERS: Well, I have something a dog forgot something.  GUTFELD: What?  WATTERS: Where he was going. Because he walked into an oil well. And a boy was dangled into the oil well to save him. Look at this kid reached down. I don't think this is the right way to rescue the dog. But he's dangled by his pants and he rescued the dog. What a hero.  SAPHIER: Please don't try this at home.  WATTERS: Speaking of heroes, ""WATTERS' WORLD"" 8:00 Eastern. We have an Epstein victim who speaks out for the very first time and tells us her experience. We also have a live PD expose. Don't miss that.  BREAM: All right.  WILLIAMS: Your favorite show.  WATTERS: My favorite besides THE FIVE.  WILLIAMS: Shannon, all caffeinated at 5:00 p.m.  BREAM: Yes, you know, I'm caffeine free. I'm just high on life. But also high dogs.  GUTFELD: Mad.  BREAM: I'm not mad.  GUTFELD: No, that's Andrew --  BREAM: Four letters, it's a different things. OK, dogs are man's best friend. But just how early does this bond start? Check this out.  Super cute. OK 16-month-old Alex's parents say that he started babbling nonstop a couple of months ago and their dog, their boxer Bentley starts talking back to him. They have these little conversations. They say before this, the dog didn't howl. But since Alex started making these little sounds and they're mimicking each other, they have their own language and the parents say they talk to each other all the time.  SAPHIER: And I'm sure that does not drive the mother crazy, whatsoever.  GUTFELD: Nicole.  SAPHIER: Guys, so if you've ever been to Chick-Fil-A, you know how important those sauces are and the dipping of the sauce while dreams coming true. That Chick-Fil-A is now putting together a test pilot in Florida where shoppers will be able to rack up on 16 ounce of bottles of the signature Chick-Fil-A and Polynesian sauces.  We have some here I would love to demonstrate with dipping some waffle fries but I don't have any waffle fries, so I can't demonstrate. But here they are. You will be able to get them in April in Florida. You may not be able to get toilet paper because it's still maybe out, but you're definitely be able to get Chick-Fil-A sauce. Each bottle will be -- cost around $3.50 and all proceeds go to their --  WILLIAMS: All right, that's it for us tonight.  Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC.

49,FOX,"Democratic presidential candidates roll out proposals to combat coronavirus pandemic; reaction on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,” March 12, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: This is what we need more than anything else. It's not about fundamentals, it's not a financial crisis, it's a crisis of confidence. The Five starts right now.  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everybody. I'm Jesse Watters along with Dr. Nicole Saphier, Juan Williams, Shannon Bream, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City. And this is THE FIVE.  President Trump taking unprecedented action as Coronavirus fears impact almost every aspect of life here in America. Wall Street taking another big beating today. The stock market dropping by almost 10 percent. Major sports leagues suspending or delaying seasons. The NCAA just announcing that this year's March Madness has officially been canceled. Large gatherings are being limited across the country. And New York City just declaring a state of emergency.  There are now more than 1,400 confirmed Coronavirus cases in the United States, and at least 37 people have died. President Trump responding by reassuring Americans that we as a country will get through this pandemic. Here he is earlier today talking about restricting travel from Europe.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We get along very well with European leaders, but we had to make a decision. And I didn't want to take time. And, you know, it takes a long time to make the individual call.  I mean, when they raised taxes on us, they don't consult us. And if Americans coming back or anybody is coming back, we're testing. We have a tremendous testing setup where people coming in have to be tested. And if they are positive, it will be a pretty strong enforcement of quarantine.  Look, the key is, you have to have separation. You have to have separation or this thing takes longer to go away.  WATTERS: Well, it seems like in the last 24 hours, it just got a lot more intense, Greg, Oval Office address and now, some new travel restrictions from across the pond. It's not something to joke about.  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: No. Is that something in the morning to me?  WATTERS: That was a warning, Greg.  GUTFELD: Yes, yes, yes. The important thing is you can't make -- you can't make fear your de vault on this. Because I think, again, we're confusing statistical risks with personal risks. I would first -- I would first ask a really dumb question.  When 9/11 occurred, we closed the stock market until September 17. That was six days because we were shell shocked. I think we're making a mistake here by not doing that. And we're making a mistake by foolishly comparing this virus to other viruses or other flus, right? Because it's like comparing last year's Super Bowl to the next year's. You're missing a crucial piece of information, which happens in the future, which we don't know.  In that case, this virus is much like 9/11. And that the whole point of terror is that it gets through undetected, when your defenses are down and that's constantly morphing and changing its shape or it mutates in order to survive. So we have to think about this the same way we think about terrorism and thinking about 9/11.  Now, thinking about the swine flu or whatever other flu you want to talk about, because we know what happened. But do remember being in New York in 9/11 walking down the street thinking the world was going to end every single day. And then you look back and go, well, we got through it. That's exactly -- right now, because you're in this thing, you feel it.  WATTERS: Right.  GUTFELD: You feel it. And also, what's different now than then, an accelerated media, a news cycle that's on hyper speed, and that also gives a sense of lack of control. How you regain that control? By doing positive things for other people, by doing practical things, and practicing all the hygiene tips that the doc suggests, because that gives you a sense of control.  But in the meantime, you're going to overstate this because you're in it. And you're going to look back and go like, wow, we got through it. And we will get through it. It's just right now it feels weird.  WATTERS: Right.  GUTFELD: One last point, I know I'm babbling. We're all getting freaked out about the NBA, baseball, hockey, you've got to understand that a lot of this stuff is legal advice. So you don't get sued. You're freaking out, I can't believe they are doing this. No, it's because some lawyer is saying you don't want this player to sue you or a corporation, you don't want somebody working here to get the virus when you could have sent them home. So all of these are just warnings.  WILLIAMS: That's a good point, Greg. Unlike some other people who have compared the Coronavirus to be Chernobyl or Katrina, you made a 9/11 comparison, is that how you see it?  NICOLE SAPHIER, FOX NEWS HOST: That is certainly not Chernobyl. I understand how Greg is drawing parallels with 9/11. What has been upsetting me is when I'm seeing the parallels being drawn from like 1918 Spanish flu. And we live in an era that's pre-antibiotic, pre-enhanced sanitizers, and hygiene, and just overall personal hygiene.  We're living in a very different time where we have a lot more information. And, you know, unfortunately, the travel bans have to be implemented. Because right now, we have community spread within our country.  And I'm not saying necessarily I agree with the exact way the travel bans are being handled because one thing that I think that they missed last night is explaining why the travel ban was in a certain area of Europe and not in other areas of Europe. And I do understand because you have a massive epicenter right now from China and now Italy is close to China. And there is free travel between Italy and a lot of these other nations.  But you also have the highest single daily increase in cases in the U.K. And that wasn't part of the travel ban. So I would like some explanation from someone on the task force as to why we chose specific areas. I do agree with travel bans. We need to focus on our internal community spread and not have a more of influx of cases coming into our country. But, again, I don't know if you can necessarily pick and choose these.  WATTERS: Juan, how do you see things today after last night's Oval Office address?  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, you know, I was sort of -- I wanted the President to give that address. I think the country would like to be assured -- reassured in some ways, Jesse. I don't think he did that, but I liked the tone of his address. I think he got the tone right. It was just in terms of the content. The kinds of things the Dr. Saphier was talking about, you know, why are you doing this country and not that country, because this country has a major outbreak? What are you thinking? We don't know.  I do think when Tom Hanks gets it and his wife, and when the NBA, and now, Major League Baseball, can you imagine cancelling the NCAA tournament? That's a big deal because initially, you think, they will just play it on TV because it's TV revenue. They just canceled it.  So, to me, this is a signal for people like me who tend to not want to be an alarmist and think, you know what, let it go. Let it pass, you know. I'm going to just be careful myself. But there is no reason to think things are really bad. You know what, I think things are bad.  WATTERS: I think people woke up when they saw on their screens that Tom Hanks had it. And when they can't watch basketball anymore, I do agree, there is probably a legal liability. But personally, I think if one player or two players from the NBA has it, maybe they go on medical leave for the rest of the season.  WILLIAMS: Right.  WATTERS: You play without crowds in the stands, but they went in another direction.  SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Yes, you think about as we learn -- you do have a lawyer and a doctor on the panel, so you're fully covered.  WATTERS: Wait, wait, wait. Is that me and Greg? Me and Greg?  BREAM: You have to think about the fans, people that take selfies. They are exposing so many people. Their trainers have to be there. What happens to the concession workers? I mean, there are so many things to consider.  I like what you said, Greg, that when it becomes personal, when you hear Tom Hanks and the NBA, it gets closer and closer to home, and we get it then in a different way. And we freak when we're in the middle of it.  And I've said today like on Twitter, one day, this is going to be in the rearview mirror. It's going to hurt in the meantime, but we are going to get through it. I believe in this country, and I believe in the systems that we have in place. But somebody tweeted me back and said, yes, this, too, shall pass, but it will be like a kidney stone.  SAPHIER: And I one thing I want to mention, Chernobyl and 9/11, those were intentional actions. Chernobyl is extreme negligence that caused such a disaster. There is nothing intentional about this novel virus causing a pandemic. And we have to remember that.  There is a sense of nature here. We have pandemics. We're going to have another one. We have to make sure we get through this, which we will. But there will be another one. And now, we have to continue to make sure that we have the right things in place and that we're a healthier America.  WATTERS: And you said, real quick, before we go, what was your time frame prediction, not to put you on the spot?  SAPHIER: Oh, boy. Honestly, I think we're going to see a lot more cases over the next few weeks. A lot more people have it than we already know and we'll find more cases as we test more.  But I would say we'll see an equilibrium once we start having - implementing these measures, just like what we've seen in China and South Korea. So I would say four to six weeks, I think we're going to level off and then we may have a decline. It may be more than four to six weeks. I don't think it's going to be four to six months, until we have an equilibrium but I don't know -- we don't know.  GUTFELD: And the good news -- I mean, the good news is, as the infection rates increase or we find them through testing, the percentage death rate will naturally go down. Right now, because we don't have that denominator.  WATTERS: Yes.  GUTFELD: We're freaking out, we don't know -- we thought it was 3.5 percent. It might be -- still 0.9 is going to be a lot. Can I just ask you one question? I know we have to go. You're not seeing cases or very little cases in Africa, Australia, Buenos Aires, is this the theory of heat and humid? A strong theory.  SAPHIER: Actually, to be honest, I think it has more to do with international travel right now. What this is, is a highly infectious disease virus. Australia, they had a travel ban. Initially, very early on, they had a travel ban. The only thing is they allowed foreign students from China come in and they had them do 14-day quarantines elsewhere, Dubai, wherever else, and then they went to Australia.  But the point is some of these people didn't actually self-quarantine and then they went to Australia. And now, Australia has it.  BREAM: And now, Tom Hanks has it.  WATTERS: All right. Up next, Democrats and the media bash President Trump's Oval Office address on the Coronavirus. Stick around.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  SAPHIER: Welcome back. The Democrats and media are not so happy with President Trump's address to the nation about the COVID-19 outbreak. Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The President referred to the Coronavirus as a foreign virus.  I think it is going to smack -- it is going to come across to a lot of Americans as xenophobia to use that kind of term in the speech.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Incompetence kills. And the response thus far from the administration has been unfortunately plagued with incompetence.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The President also called this a foreign virus. What does he accomplish by making this an outsider's problem?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It is kind of America first rhetorical flourish that has nothing to do with public health, safety, or public health communication.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Don't you think this is a good time for him to resign?  (END VIDEO CLIP)  SAPHIER: Wow. OK, so, Jesse, I want to go to you first. He got a lot of heap for calling this a foreign virus, to the extent of calling him xenophobic. What do you feel about that?  WATTERS: The President goes out there on TV and calls for unity, hope, and resilience and the media calls on him to resign. How sick is that? This guy is not interested in political correctness. He's trying to save lives. If the virus originated in Brooklyn, they would call it Brooklyn virus and other countries would be slapping travel bans on America.  It is what it is. It's just about saving lives. And I want to talk about lives and put it into perspective for a second. There have been 37 deaths here in the United States, from Coronavirus. Every death is tragic. But swine flu, during 2010 under Barack Obama, there were 13,000 deaths, 60 million Americans were infected.  So 37 versus 13,000, that's a big difference. Now, I'm not downplaying it. I'm putting it in context. And what the President gets hit on is, they say he's downplaying it. Where I'm seeing it, he's trying to reduce fear. If you say we have to be optimistic and we're going to beat this thing and eventually it's going to end, but at the same time, trying to say we've got to wash our hands, quarantine, slap travel bans on.  That's a comprehensive approach. And he's trying to be aggressive and he's dynamic. And he's changed gears a little bit because he's responding to how the pandemic is met metastasizing.  Last point, this is not a financial crisis. Once we get a handle on thing, markets are going to rally hard back. And we can all get back to watching basketball.  SAPHIER: So, Juan, I have a question for you. Because you said that you liked the tone of his address last night. And there were some -- there were some errors in his address. Now, do you think -- I kind of want to know where the error is from. Because to me, it seems like he was reading a script. I mean, a lot of times, he just speaks off-the-cuff. It actually seemed like he was reading a script last night. So, do you think the speech writers potentially had something to do with his errors and it wasn't necessarily his incompetence as people are saying?  WILLIAMS: Well, he's the President, so, I mean, you can't not take responsibility as President when you're addressing the American people. So, as I said yesterday here, the speech had to be thoroughly vetted. And apparently, it wasn't.  But I mean on the flip side, you've got to understand, and this is what I would say to Jesse, because the Democrats didn't like the speech or some people in the media didn't like the speech, that's not the point. I mean, the point is that he failed to reassure because of the errors that we're referring to.  For example, I would say in terms of the travel ban, explain it. I would say talk about the fact we haven't had testing and that the doctor says that was a fail. Talk about where the virus is now, what we can do to reduce its spread in our country. We see all these people acting independently, Broadway, the NBA, certain school systems, where is the leadership?  SAPHIER: Well, actually, I will -- I will say that he did have a great call to Americans last night. And that was my favorite part of his speech. He talked about what he wanted to do from the economic side. He talked about the travel ban but then he also said Americans, you have to do this, you have to avoid public places, nonessential travel.  I mean, I think that's what's most important here, Shannon. Didn't you think that message did come across?  BREAM: I mean, I hope when he kind of appealed to our better nature, our better nature or better angels, and this optimistic thing, America can do this. We've done this before. We're going to come out the other side. We do have to keep reminding ourselves we're going to be looking at this in the rearview mirror, and not super distant future, we hope.  Jason Riley had a great piece in the Wall Street Journal this week. He said no matter what, this is going to be politicized. If he comes across as being urgent and overreacting, he's going to be accused as inciting panic. If he seems calm and not that into it, he's going to be accused of -- the word he used was lackadaisical.  But this guy, right now, I feel like, you know, he's not going to be able to win. He can't make both sides happy. It's a little dispiriting because you would hope in this moment -- listen, if Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi who immediately put out a statement saying how terrible it was last night, I think you can criticize the President. But maybe in this moment, for the country, you call him up, you sit down at the White House, or read on the phone, maybe think of the greater picture before you immediately put out a press release that didn't -- you know, wasn't too long after the speech that sounded like it might have been pre-written.  WILLIAMS: But I just want to make this point. They were real. I mean, let's forget the partisan take. I mean, there were real mistakes that the White House had to walk back about cargo and people being banned. No, no, no, not cargo, we're talking about humans. Oh, no, not American citizens, American citizens can come back.  I mean, these are mistakes that he made. He talks about, you know, flu, as Greg was saying, this is more dangerous than the flu in so many ways. And he wants to equate where he says your health insurer will cover this. You don't have to pay -- well, it turns out they will cover the test, but they won't cover the treatment.  SAPHIER: I agree. And I agree that there are some mistakes in his speech last night. However, I appreciated the tone. And I appreciated the message.  Now, Greg, Obama got some criticism for his Gulf Oil speech, where they said there was a lot of rhetoric, very short on answers and other things. Do you feel -- I personally did not feel last night's speech was full of rhetoric. I thought he was actually getting to the point and telling us his plans. How do you think it compares?  GUTFELD: It doesn't matter what he says, because the media and the Democrats will nitpick. I don't blame them because that's what you do when you're out of power. You think that the Democrats are out of power but remember, it's the media that's out of power in this administration.  So no matter what Donald Trump does, he's going to get nailed. They -- when you call it a foreign virus or call it the Wuhan virus, that's racist. Is Ebola racist? Because it's named after a river, another was named after a place. Rocky Mountain Fever is named after the Rocky Mountains. All right.  What is really frustrating, you can't trust people anymore because their political hatred is guiding their words, right. And these are people I would normally listen to, but I can't, because you can hear the dripping invective that contaminates their opinions. That's also a virus.  I can say fairly that I think America is doing great. I'm disappointed that the stock market isn't closed. That bothers me. I think Trump needs to adjust the way he talks about this. He needs to improve on it because in his heart, Trump is an optimist, right.  He's used to engaging and competing against groups, Democrats, and media. A virus is not something you vanquish. It's something you avoid and prepare against. That's something new for him. It may not be in his tool box, but he's a quick learner. And he should learn it.  And so, coming from me -- you should trust me, that I say positive things. And I said negative things. But when you listen to the -- when you listen to CNN, Don Lemon screaming at a never Trumper, John Kasich, he wouldn't pile on the President, you see that you can't trust these jerks because they are polluted with bias. Juan.  WILLIAMS: But I'm going to tell you something. I'm not polluted with bias, but I'll tell you this. Let's take the politics away.  GUTFELD: I have.  WILLIAMS: People who are in the game, Wall Street, who have every reason to say President Trump has been pretty good to Wall Street, what did they do? They said that speech didn't reassure us. It didn't buy us any sense.  GUTFELD: You're mindreading.  WILLIAMS: We don't know what's coming.  SAPHIER: We can't blame him. We can't blame him this happened. We got to go.  So, up next, Joe Biden and Democrats are attacking President Trump over his response to the COVID-19 outbreak. More of that.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WILLIAMS: Joe Biden -- they love my music. Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders hammering the Trump administration's response to the Coronavirus outbreak. Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The leadership will panic, a fall back on gynophobia, labeling COVID-19 a foreign virus does not displace the accountability for the misjudgments that have been taken thus far by the Trump administration.  The administration's failure on testing is colossal. Nor should we hide the true number of infections to protect the political interests or the stock markets. The markets will respond strong -- to strong, capable leadership. That addresses the root of the problem, not efforts to cover it up.  BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We have an administration that is largely incompetent, and whose incompetence and recklessness have threatened the lives of many, many people in our country. The American people deserve transparency, something that the current administration has fought day after day to stifle.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: So, Dr. Saphier, let me just say, what I took away from the Biden speech was sort of that he felt -- he's the Democratic nominee, he laid out for the American people how he would respond to this issue.  And on that point, he said he would expand the testing, boost hospital capacity, create an information hotline for people, and offer assistance to people who are losing their jobs. How did you react?  SAPHIER: I mean, to me, that just sounds like Oprah, like we're going to do this, and you can have this, you can have a house, you can have a school. Yes, of course, we want to do that. And President Trump has said the same thing. We're going to expand testing. We're going to make sure we have enough physicians and nurses able. Everyone says certain things and I want to know how exactly you're going to do that.  And, you know, listening to Bernie Sanders, he said he is going to do -- if this were him, he would declare a state of emergency. And he put together a bipartisan emergency group, full of experts. What do you think the task force is? We have several doctors there, people have been pointed by Obama and people have been pointed by Trump. And we have experts working on this together.  So, I, again, feel like that's a lot of rhetoric. And you can say that you would do these things, but they are not giving specifics. What I want from the President, I want him to tell us it will be OK. I know it's going to be OK. But the American people need to know it's going to be OK.  So I liked the tone last night. There were some -- some errors in his messaging. But I like that he said we're going to be OK, but here's what we're doing and here's what we need to do. I thought it was great in that sense.  WILLIAMS: Right. But I think that, obviously, the President is now -- and this I took from his speech last night, acknowledging the severity of this crisis, where as previously he was somewhat dismissive.  Now you have a situation, Jesse, where I think that the Democrats are saying, here's what we would do. So I think that was very concrete and specific about actions they would take that the President is not discussing.  WATTERS: The President is discussing it, Juan. He's trying to get Nancy and Chuck in a room with Mitch and solve the problem. And that's what Wall Street wants. They want a fix. And right now, both sides in Washington won't put their knives down and fix it.  Everything Joe Biden read off that teleprompter were things the President is doing. I wasn't blown away by Biden's speech at all. I'll give him this. Testing capacity is not where it needs to be. That's on the CDC. They have plenty of money. Here's the criticism. This is what Joe said, that this was a foreign-born virus, you can't say that. The virus is from China. It's a foreign country, Joe.  WILLIAMS: No, no, no. His point was, how does that help us deal with that situation.  WATTERS: You know what, he calls it how he sees it, Juan. And it is a foreign-born virus.  WILLIAMS: Fine.  WATTERS: Joe said that last month. He said it's from China.  WILLIAMS: Right. So -- but how does that help us?  WATTERS: What do you mean, how does it help us? It's from a foreign country. You have foreigners coming to America and that's why you slap a travel ban.  WILLIAMS: It's already here. It's already here.  WATTERS: Right. And you want to prevent it from spreading, Juan.  WILLIAMS: Right.  NICOLE SAPHIER, FOX NEWS MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: And calling the President - -  WATTERS: And one of the things you do in your toolbox is slap travel bans. Another he said which was ridiculous that the travel ban is racist and xenophobic. This travel ban that he slapped on China a month ago, every doctor now acknowledges was the right move. And the scientists agree.  Last thing, real quick. During the swine flu, Biden said something that scared the entire airline industry. And Joe Gibbs, White House Press Secretary at the time had to go up on the podium and apologize on behalf of Joe for scaring everybody, and he had to clean up that mess. So Joe is the last person I would want in charge during a pandemic.  WILLIAMS: Joe Gibbs was the --  BREAM: I will -- I will say this though.  WATTERS: Robert. I call him Joe.  WILLIAMS: OK. All right. Just don't call him a (INAUDIBLE).  BREAM: Don't call him late for dinner. I think though I will give credit to the Democrats. And listen, they're in a political fight. They're trying to win the nomination of their party. We are in political season. But I appreciate if a Democrat is going to be critical of the president that they come out with their own steps. That they say these are THE FIVE things I can do. So either the administration can say, we aren't doing that, we haven't outlined every single step we're doing. Or they can say, good, OK, yes, how can we work that in? Would that be feasible? How would it work?  Listen, though, on Capitol Hill, those folks who are already elected, got some problems there because, you know, we hear that they're trying to talk for all kinds of writers and things into these bills that they're putting together. Both sides just need to stop it for the American people. Get it done. Get it done and get something to the President's desk.  If they all got to get in the room and hash it out. Don't leave Washington don't take a recess. I mean, get it done. But I think regardless of party, if you're offering concrete solutions, good, we need an airing of those and we need to hear how we can fix the problem.  WILLIAMS: So Greg, I thought that -- as I said, I thought they were concrete solutions and what Joe Biden had to say. The biggest one to me, and I think I hear this when I from the experts is expand hospital capacity.  GUTFELD: I don't think anybody would disagree with that. But the whole point of this is to compare their performance to Trump. So first, let's do that. Number one, neither Joe or Bernie took questions, so right there they flunk because you got to think fast and you got to think what surprises and go off script, what Trump is really good at.  Number two, Biden's lied. He's a liar and he's a tool. He lied when he said -- when he opened the thing up and said this isn't about politics, and spent eight months saying that Trump was an unfit president, and that he would be a president. That's politics. He also accused the president of a cover-up. That's politics.  So he is a liar and a tool and he's losing his mind before our eyes. He is unfit. That -- it just upset me that he went to that place. Now, Trump's words could be better, but his deeds are effective. His deeds are effective enough to buy us time so that we can prepare and also to prepare for mistakes.  If we didn't have a robust economy and we didn't know ahead of time of what was coming. What would have happened with this testing fiasco, right? Fiasco, fiasco, yes, that's a good word. Anyway, I'm going to, stop because I'm getting mad.  WILLIAMS: But I wish we did. I wish we had acted.  WATTERS: You're getting mad.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: We didn't act in time. We didn't act in time.  GUTFELD: I want to say a nice thing about Bernie. I want to say a nice thing about Bernie. At least Bernie is real and you believe what he's saying. Joe is a cardboard contraption standing up there to speak, saying stupid things about it's racist, and it's a cover-up. He doesn't know what he's saying.  WILLIAMS: Yes, I think -- I think Wall Street thinks Trump doesn't know what he's saying.  GUTFELD: Then you're an expert on Wall Street.  WILLIAMS: No. I'm just saying, Wall Street -- I don't have to be an expert. Wall Street had its verdict very clearly. And the whole thing from Trump is he was saying it's not a problem. It'll pass in a few days. You can go to work. It's just not effective leadership.  GUTFELD: All right.  WILLIAMS: Stay with THE FIVE for the latest breaking news on the coronavirus. We're going to bring you some of it here next on THE FIVE.  BREAM: President Trump defending against criticism over his decision to clamp down on passenger travel coming into the U.S. from more than two dozen European countries. Here's the president earlier.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If I didn't close very, very early -- you know, we close very early with China, and I took a heat from you people, a lot of heat. They call me everything from a racist to everything else, so it's terrible. And the same people, then they say, he close too fast, why did he close -- most of them said why did he close which I -- when you think of what happened to your -- because it was very fast and very furious and what happened is a lot of people went from China into Europe, and Europe suffered tremendously.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  BREAM: All right, as you earlier said, that there are people on both sides of the aisle, all sides of the aisle, doctors who are saying this was the right move. Fauci said things would be much worse here already if the president hadn't done this, but his critics are not changing their assessment of what he did back then. But Doctor, let's talk about the fact that what we're trying to do now, we know the cases are going to explode here as testing does, but the negatives are going to explode as well.  I mean, we're going to see that there are people fully recovering. There are negative tests. Our numbers are going to go up. But the idea is to flatten this, to flatten the curve instead of having this spike where we do overrun the hospitals and people completely freak out. How can these travel bans help to flatten that? We know the cases are coming, but spread them out over time so that our medical system can handle them.  SAPHIER: Well, you know, Biden was right in one sense when he said that there's a cover-up. And it was in the sense that there was a cover-up, but it was from China. And China did not tell us -- they actually said to their people, that this is not a highly contagious virus. They were testing them and then sending them home without quarantine, which is why they have now over 80,000 cases.  But here's the good news. Over -- the majority of them are already recovered and they're seeing less and less cases every day just like South Korea. The reasons that they having fewer cases is because of tight restrictions and increased testing. So we need to do that here in the United States. Travel bans give us time, give us time here to lesson community spread and be prepared.  What we need to do for that is we need aggressive testing. We need our private sector to step up just like it did in South Korea. That is why South Korea has gotten this under control because their private sector, four private companies started making these tests. Not the government, we need to stop depending just on the CDC. We are a nation of capitalism.  Yes. And fighters, I believe, and survivors. All right, we're going to make it quickly around the table. So Juan, will you give the president some credit on the early ban regarding China?  WILLIAMS: It wasn't early. In fact, it should have been early.  BREAM: Wait, wait, wait a minute.  WATTERS: Very good, Juan.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: (INAUDIBLE) and you were against it. Roll the tape. You were against it.  SAPHIER: You called it -- he's called it racist.  (CROSSTALK)  BREAM: Hey, hey, hey, you're all getting (INAUDIBLE)  WILLIAMS: Can I explain -- can I explain that the president -- the president had knowledge of this that we didn't have. And then -- and then - -  BREAM: We were talking about this.  WILLIAMS: I see you don't want to hear, but anyway -- yes, because here's - -  GUTFELD: Yes, because it's not true, Juan.  WILLIAMS: You can't handle the truth. The truth is that when the President -- that when the President acted, it was again, not clear to everybody the extent. And we had people going from China, guess where, Italy, North Korea.  BREAM: Which is what the President said. Which is what the president said. All right.  WILLIAMS: But it's just like what happened yesterday with, oh, not England, when in fact the cases are spiking in England.  BREAM: OK, Jesse.  WATTERS: Juan, you've totally discredited yourself.  WILLIAMS: Yes, by hanging around with you.  WATTERS: It's over. It's done. We don't believe anything anymore because you will criticize no matter what he does.  WILLIAMS: That's not true.  WATTERS: And then pretend like what you said two months ago didn't happened.  WILLIAMS: But Jesse, he didn't --  WATTERS: I will pull the tape and I will show everybody --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: (INAUDIBLE) because I knew he was going to say this.  BREAM: OK, all right.  WATTERS: Here's the thing. I love being right about this one.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: Wow, that's a lot. It just takes a lot to say that way.  WILLIAMS: Because this guy makes mistakes. I mean, you cover in any example and say, oh, no criticism.  WATTERS: Juan, stop.  BREAM: No, no, no. The President makes mistakes and we make note of that.  GUTFELD: The first person to mention a travel ban on this show and I think on the network was me and Juan, you push back and said, what about what happened with Ebola? You were like, oh, I'm so concerned. So you're lying, Juan.  WILLIAMS: Yes. That's concerned. That's not a lie. In other words, telling you the truth about concerns and realism --  GUTFELD: Oh, so now you said it should have been faster, which would have been a violation of what you said before.  WILLIAMS: No. If he -- if he had all of us, we understand the severity of this rather than trying to downplay it --  SAPHIER: Can you see how politely Shannon is sitting here? Shannon is sitting so politely.  BREAM: We are going to continue this as a paper view somewhere during the commercial, but up next, the ""FASTEST SEVEN.""  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: This is a Fox News alert. Dr. Anthony Fauci talking to reporters outside the White House. Listen in.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: The only way that works is if you get the private sector involved, some of the standard companies that make the diagnostic test that you and I get when we go for a regular visit to a physician. They have been engaged right now. The FDA, the CDC, all of the government agencies, the Secretary himself, Secretary Azar, has been very much involved in working with that group to be able to get that revved up really quickly.  You know, I hate to give dates on things, but what I'm hearing from the task force meeting that I just left, that that should very likely happen within the next week or so. It's not going to be months, it's going to be a week or so where you're going to get many, many more tests that are going to be available.  The other thing that's important, and there was a considerable amount of misunderstanding about that, that the original guidelines for whether you could get a test was somewhat restrictive. The FDA has now removed those restrictions. You know, it was part of the thing was, well, you have to have been either in contact with someone or very closely geographically. It doesn't matter where you are who you are, you could get a test.  (CROSSTALK)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Dr. Fauci, Maryland and Ohio -- Maryland and Ohio have just closed their schools, Dr. Fauci.  FAUCI: Who do I --  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Her first, then I'll go.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Maryland and Ohio has decided to close schools. Do you advise for other states to do the same?  FAUCI: You know, you have to take it by a state by state basis. The one thing I do advise and I've said this at multiple hearings and multiple briefings, that right now, we have to start implementing both containment and mitigation. And what was done when you do closing the school is mitigation.  We've got to try as best as we can, to distance ourselves from each other, particularly if you are within a group that are at higher risk, if you do get infected, you're going to have a complication. And those are the elderly, people with underlying conditions, chronic congestive heart failure, heart disease, lung disease, kidney disease, diabetes, particularly among those if you're an elderly with that.  So those are the kinds of things we need to do now. And the point that I was trying to make is that we don't want to wait until you get a lot of infections because sometimes when you make -- whether it be Maryland, whatever they did, you make a decision to do something. And someone might say, well, are you overreacting. We got to -- we got to lose that. We got to start looking at doing things now in anticipation of what might happen.  And the reason is if you look at infectious diseases, how they work, particularly outbreaks of new infections, they go like this, then they go like this, and then they shoot up like that. And if you look at the curves of the history of outbreaks, they have the sharp peak, and then they start coming down. If you look at what happened in China. That's exactly what happened. It's starting to happen a little bit now in Korea.  The purpose and the goal of both containment and mitigation is to instead of making it go up like that, blunted so it goes like that. You're never going to suppress it completely. So we have to get used to it. We're going to get infections and probably a lot more infections.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you think the travel ban has helped for that?  FAUCI: I think it absolutely has. I believe if we did not do that with China early on --  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What about with Europe?  FAUCI: Well, well, I think that was a prudent choice. We spent a lot of time thinking about it, discussing it about whether we should do it, and it was the right public health call. And here's the numerical reason why. If you look back early on, Chinese travelers who were infected, ceded not only the United States but countries in Europe, including Italy.  If you look today at the majority of cases that are new cases, not old ones, new cases throughout the world, the majority of them are from Europe, Europe to other countries. If you look in the United States, at states that have new cases, the majority of them are coming from that region. It was based on that, that the travel restriction was suggested and accepted.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Dr. Fauci, even --  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Dr. Fauci, are you considering --  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Let's move on to Kaitlan.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Dr. Fauci, even when the testing criteria was at its most restrictive, one of the standards was if you'd been in touch with someone who is positive with coronavirus. So how could anyone make the argument that the President shouldn't be tested?  FAUCI: I'm sorry?  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: One of the standards of being tested for coronavirus, if I'm correct, was that you've been in contact with someone who's now testing positive.  FAUCI: Right.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So how can anyone make the argument that the president who we now know was in contact with the Brazilian press secretary shouldn't get a test?  FAUCI: And like I said, I am not going to comment on an individual who has a very competent physician and the White House physician is very prominent. Yes?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sir, can we step inside the West Wing?  FAUCI: OK, good.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We need to cut this off. You can all move to the press briefing room for a few minutes please.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is there going to be a briefing?  (END VIDEOTAPE)  GUTFELD: All right. That was Dr. Fauci. Jesse, he was talking about how -- the reason for the travel restrictions, because that was a path of infection that they were seeing a lot of these people coming from Europe.  WATTERS: Right. So it started in China, and we had the travel ban on there, so that helped. And then they went around to Europe. And then from Europe, they came into the United States. And after consulting with the whole Task Force, they decided to slap it on the E.U. And I just think that's smart.  Right now, he said, we're doing containment and mitigation. And that's instead of you're getting that huge spike, you're trying to blunt the spike, because the Wayne Gretzky analogy from the other day was brilliant. Because you don't go where the puck is, you anticipate where the puck will be. And that's what they're trying to do now. And they're doing the best job they can. And as he said, there will be more infections, but they're doing the best they can to test.  GUTFELD: I don't know much about baseball, but I think I understand. Doc, upfront there, he was talking a lot about private sector involvement. Can you will -- you know, add anything to what he might --  WILLIAMS: Yes, before we do, let's give her credit because she said --  BREAM: I literally just said that.  SAPHIER: Yes, we need the private sector involved and that was his opening remarks. And I agree because the South Korea already had -- they have a lot of cases and they're seeing a decrease in cases right now. And it's not because containment measures. They didn't do the stuff that China's doing.  They didn't shut everything down. They had testing and they had testing right away. And that is because four tech companies came out, put together this test. It was a rapid test. It didn't take days to come back. It took hours to come back. And they gave it to their people. And now they're supplying it to the rest of the world.  Shockingly, they're running low on material now because we depend on reagents from Germany, we depend on a lot of things from everywhere. But that's what they did. And now we are dealing with it. Our private sector also needs to step up. We need to make the reagents here and we need to make these testing kits here.  GUTFELD: You know, Juan, I think you and me both can agree that we're kind of bombed that this broke into covering Sarah Palin on the Masked Singer.  WILLIAMS: You know, it's a rare moment. It's a rare moment. But Sarah Palin on the Masked Singer deserved attention from America today. She was terrific. She was terrific. Clearly, no evidence of any virus. That girl was shaking.  BREAM: Yes, she was. She's having a good time.  GUTFELD: Yes. So what did you -- what did you take from the Fauci -- anything hits you?  BREAM: As we were talking about, I mean, he has worked through numerous administrations and numerous crises. This guy is not new to this. He's a very respected voice. And I think when he just calm and says, yes, we're going to have a spike in cases and we're going to have more trouble, I think people feel comfortable listening to him across the board, regardless of party or ideology or anything else.  He needs to be out there every day. The administration needs to get someone out there every day, because transparency is the only thing that is going to reassure people, I think.  SAPHIER: And I think this man, he is so intelligent in what he's doing. He's been doing this for decades. And his message has been this. We expect the virus to do this. We know this is going to happen. So as we keep seeing the numbers of cases and deaths happening and increasing and it's like a shock factor every day, Fauci is saying this, this is expected. So let's do what we can now to do this and we're doing that.  So we're still on our way up, but it will -- it will start to even out. Just give it time and do your best to stop community spread.  WILLIAMS: Yes, but I think what the Wall Street Journal said this morning, you got to be honest with people and you can't say things and then walk it back 10 minutes later.  WATTERS: All right, this is great. Juan is praising the private sector and the Wall Street Journal all in one hour.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: Time now for ""ONE MORE THING."" I'm going to go first, as Greg mentioned. And as Juan, definitely put an exclamation mark on, Sarah Palin was on the Masked Singer last night. Watch this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  NICK CANNON, ACTOR: Oh my God, wow, you guys, you cannot believe.  NICOLE SCHERZINGER, JUDGE, MASKED SINGER: Is that Tina Fey?  CANNON: She's putting on her glass first. Governor Sarah Palin.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: She's absolutely amazing.  WATTERS: Yes, I mean, we should keep showing it. It actually gets better from there. I m1ean, she definitely would have made a greater V.P. than Joe Biden.  BREAM: Tina Fey did play her though, didn't she, on SNL?  WILLIAMS: Yes. But this was more than funny, she's actually good at dancing and rapping.  GUTFELD: No, she's great. It's amazing.  WATTERS: She's great. And thank you very much.  BREAM: OK, and listen. Because Dana is not here and I'm filling in for her, I, of course, have to do a dog story. You know that's happening. I love this. Catcher out in Colorado, a three-year-old golden retriever. There were some people working at the house. He got out.  A FedEx driver finds Catcher, looks at the tag, texts the family and says I found your dog. I'm taking the dog back to the address that's on the tag. And their little you know, surveillance cam catches this FedEx driver, taking Catcher back to the house, putting the doggie inside, and Catcher was safe and sound.  This is a good Samaritan. Listen, the FedEx driver did not have to do this. He's not getting paid for this. But Catcher is not fighting it. He's fully picked up and ready to go.  WILLIAMS: All is good.  BREAM: 60 pounds of him.  WATTERS: Caught the Catcher.  GUTFELD: There you go. I want to let everybody know who got tickets to the Gutfeld Monologues, we are postponing.  WATTERS: That's bigger than the NCAA thing.  GUTFELD: It is.  BREAM: A long national nightmare.  GUTFELD: I care about my fans, Jesse. And so the Memphis will be moved to September 12th, Nashville will be moved to I think August 9th, and all tickets will be honored, blah, blah, blah. You know, you can trust us, but can you trust this?  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Animals are great. Animals are great. Animals are great.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: In these trying times, you know what you need, puppies jumping rope. Take a look at this. This is amazing. Look at this.  BREAM: Oh my God.  GUTFELD: Research shows that stress increases your risk for disease but watching puppies jumping rope reduces stress, reduces infection, because I'm a doctor. All right.  BREAM: I love the little white one. It's stretching out like getting ready.  WATTERS: Better than yesterday's, ball bouncing up.  WILLIAMS: You know what it wasn't better then?  WATTERS: Sarah Palin.  GUTFELD: Something that unites us all.  WILLIAMS: All right, you never know where you're going to find extraordinary talent. How about an electronics store in the Philippines? Yes, the Philippines. Take a look.  Yes, that boy surprise shoppers when he grabbed the microphone and created an orchestra of one by singing percussion and other beat --  GUTFELD: No Sarah Palin, Juan.  WILLIAMS: What a kid. Sign him up. Give that kid a contract.  WATTERS: Not too bad. All right.  SAPHIER: All right guys, my turn. So COVID-19 has brought into light, how those with chronic illnesses are more vulnerable to severity of the symptoms, which brings to light my book that I have available for presale now where I talk about all chronic disease called Make America Healthy Again, how bad behavior and big government caused a trillion-dollar crisis, and how this is actually making us a very vulnerable society, the how much chronic disease we have and how much of it is actually preventable.  WATTERS: How did you come up with that book title?  SAPHIER: That's a great -- that's a great question.  WATTERS: It's an amazing title. It was incredible.  SAPHIER: It was -- it was a group effort.

50,FOX,"Bernie Sanders sinks, Joe Biden swims in Midwest primaries. Former Vice President Joe Biden's victories in recent Democratic presidential primaries have been a triumph of taxidermy. So what did we learn, America? First, politics is like real estate. It's location, location, location. As forceful as Bernie’s vision was, it was in the wrong place: America. Being a socialist in the most successful economy in history is like trying to sell Ben & Jerry's ice cream in Siberia. BRIT HUME WARNS BIDEN'S GAFFES SUGGEST FORMER VP 'IS LOSING HIS MEMORY AND IS GETTING SENILE' America listened to a 78-year-old try to sell a bad idea that's twice his age. Americans said, ""No way."" And the youth vote? It looks like the 50-plus crowd, who pay their bills, make wiser choices. Surprise! Biden is similar to a cardboard contraption that may have structural flaws. At least it's standing in the right place. Plus, he remembered his pants. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Perhaps Democrats who vote for Biden are purchasing a ""teardown."" It's not for the structure. It’s for the land. His pick for vice president may be in charge at some point if he wins. So voting for him is like snapping up a prime lot to build the Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., home, or a Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., castle, or a Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., wigwam. Which is why Democrats want to end this thing before a debate. They know that with each passing week, the weakness of what they're left with is becoming more apparent. They should've blasted the radical leftism of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., early on, but they liked the look of agreeing with him. He's going nowhere. ""Donald Trump must be defeated, and I will do everything in my power to make that happen,"" Sanders said in a speech Wednesday. ""On Sunday night, in the first one-on-one debate of this campaign, the American people will have the opportunity to see which candidate is best positioned to accomplish that goal. ...

51,FOX,"The World Health Organization officially designates the coronavirus outbreak as a global pandemic due to its spread and severity; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.'  This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" March 11, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Excuse me, I wiped my face.  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Don't touch your face.  GUTFELD: Yeah, it's crap. If I'm Greg Gutfeld with Nancy Grace, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and she built an igloo in her icebox, Dana Perino. THE FIVE.  GUTFELD: It was a triumph of taxidermy.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Another big night for Joe Biden who will add to a delegate lead over Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. With a series of wins tonight, the rest of the evening is shaping up very nicely for Joe Biden.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: So what did we learn, America? First, politics is like real estate, location, location, location. As forceful as Bernie's vision was, it was in the wrong place. America. Being a socialist in the most successful economy in history is like trying to sell Ben & Jerry's in Siberia.  America, listen to a 70-year-old trying to sell a bad idea that's twice his age and said, no way. It looks like the 50-plus crowd who pay their bills will make wiser choices, surprise. Meanwhile, with Joe, that cardboard contraption may have structural flaws, but at least it's standing in the right place. Plus, he remembered his pants.  As one wise man once said to come perhaps yesterday on this very show, Dana, the Dems voting for Biden are purchasing a teardown. It's not for the structure, but the land. Is it VP pick may be in charge at some point if he wins. So voting for him is like snapping up a prime lot in which to build the Harris home, the Klobuchar castle, and Warren wigwam, which is why the Dems want to end this thing before a debate. They know that with each passing week, the weaknesses of what they are left with become more apparent. They should have blasted Sanders radical leftism early on, but they liked the look of agreeing on with him. So they're going nowhere.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  BERNIE SANDERS, U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Donald Trump must be defeated. And I will do everything in my power to make that happen. On Sunday night, in the first one-on-one debate of this campaign, the American people will have the opportunity to see which candidate is best positioned to accomplish that.  I very much look forward to the debate in Arizona with my friend, Joe Biden.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: So, the Dems had two choices. The radically wrong, who honestly reflects the party's secret socialism, or the conventional codger who limped to the finish line to deliver someone younger and new like Hillary. It could work. But if they don't get Biden prepped and propped before Trump, it will be like feeding old growth logs to a wood chipper.  All right, Jesse, Bernie is staying in. Do you think it's a conspiracy? He staying in because he's not sure Joe is going to make it to the end. But for the convention, right, if he doesn't make it to the convention then Bernie will say, here I am, everybody.  WATTERS: Yeah, he is hedging his bets. But just before we get into this, Greg, you've fallen in love with the stare down analogy.  GUTFELD: Yes, I have.  WATTERS: You're going to use this thing every day beat until the convention. And I'm going to get sick of it. America, you've been warned. I do think this debate is a big test for Joe.  GUTFELD: Yeah.  WATTERS: He's a terrible debater. He's probably lost every single one of the debates he was in.  GUTFELD: Yeah.  WATTERS: Yet he is still standing. I don't think he's going to do one on one well against Bernie Sanders. I just don't. And I feel bad for him. And I don't feel bad for anybody.  GUTFELD: That's true.  WATTERS: I have very little empathy for anybody.  GUTFELD: You're a cold person.  WATTERS: But it's going to be a sad situation. He loses his temper with regular voters. How is he going to do against Donald Trump? Trump is going to make his head spin. Joe Biden, this is not Presidential timber. He's a bad communicator, he is not that sharp, has poor instincts, and has no magnetism. The guy doesn't have what it takes. He was in the senate for 36 years. He was VP for eight years.  NANCY GRACE, FOX NEWS HOST: I actually think he's still running for the senate.  WATTERS: Exactly, that's right. He's past his due date. His brother is involved with fraud charges. His son is stiffing his baby mama and blamed it on Coronavirus.  GUTFELD: I love that.  WATTERS: Not a good look for Joe. But Bernie, Bernie had his back against the wall and didn't throw a punch. I mean, it doesn't look like Bernie wanted it. And I think everybody watching him knows that once you praise communism, there's no way to beat Donald Trump. Black America went with Joe and that was all she wrote.  But if you think about it, Bernie had no chance to beat Donald Trump. Joe Biden had better than no chance, but that's still not a very good chance. So at the end of the day, the only thing you could say about Joe is he saved his party from socialism.  GUTFELD: What do you think Nancy, any strong predictions?  GRACE: Well, the reality is that even if Sanders does a horrible job -- excuse me, even if Biden does a horrible job against Sanders, which he welcome it doesn't matter, because the Democrats have coalesce and congeal around Biden. So no matter what happens, that's what it is going to be, Trump beats Biden.  And I've got to say that Sanders has passion. He believes it, even though it is socialism like Cuba. But I don't think Biden has any clue about what's going on. Now, if Jill Biden ran, there might be an entirely different story. Remember when she blocked that person that was running towards her?  WATTERS: Joe can jump on stage and knock them down.  GUTFELD: She is a doctor. And we need a doctor in these trying times, Juan. What's your analysis, Mr. Williams?  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, it seems to me that Joe Biden had a great night last night. I think he's -- I don't think there's much of a way that you could conceive of him not being the nominee at this juncture.  WATTERS: True.  WILLIAMS: But I do think that even though you have the lead and the ball, you can fumble or you can throw an interception. Who was that? I think, was it the Seattle Seahawks threw an interception.  WATTERS: On the one-yard line.  WILLIAMS: On the one-yard line. So these things do happen, right. But I do think that what you are saying about Joe Biden reminds me of what you said about Joe Biden way back. Oh, he's made so many mistakes, he's a stiff, he can't debate, but guess what, Joe Biden is doing pretty good.  GUTFELD: But that's because of the congealing.  WILLIAMS: No, it's not. The voters -- the Democratic voters are not congealing. Real people went and cast their vote for Joe Biden.  WATTERS: It's true. They confused the man with the communist.  WILLIAMS: No, you know what, it is a choice between a decent, upstanding proven public servant and Donald Trump.  GUTFELD: And, Dana, give us your expertise.  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: OK. So, Biden I think went to Michigan once.  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: He won every single county in Michigan.  GUTFELD: Right.  PERINO: In higher margins than in 2016 that Bernie got. And I think that everybody should look at 2016. The Democrats in their zeal for Bernie Sanders, because he has passion and he has these ideas, they feel like he has to debate the ideas. The truth is I don't think that the Democrats were as far left at some of us were thinking.  GUTFELD: Right.  PERINO: They just could not stand Hillary.  GUTFELD: Yeah.  PERINO: If you look at these breakdowns, white men voted for Bernie in 2016. They all went for Biden in 2020 because they did not like the choice between Bernie and Hillary.  GUTFELD: Right.  PERINO: And that -- so then that lesson was not learned. Now, you have Biden who -- now, you have to go to a debate, to debate these ideas of Bernie Sanders that have been rejected across the country by Democrats that are actually voting.  GUTFELD: To that point, I have some sound on tape, sought for you people at home of Bernie talking about how he's winning the generational battle. Let's play that, for the heck of it.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SANDERS: We are winning the generational debate, while Joe Biden continues to do very well with older Americans, especially those people over 65. Our campaign continues to win the vast majority of the votes of younger people. And I am talking about people not just in their 20s, but in their 30s and their 40s.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: Well, the thing is, you can have a movement. And that's great.  GUTFELD: I do.  PERINO: A lot of people like to have a movement or two per day. The thing is if it's a movement -- I'm just frustrated with this whole thing with Bernie Sanders, it's so amazing. OK, you have young people that come to your rallies, and they love, and they do love you. I get it. And they will vote for you. But in these tiny little numbers, it doesn't matter if you're not moving the needle. So there are older voters, they chose somebody else.  GUTFELD: Do you know the irony is? MTV started rock the vote, and now, those are the older voters and they are rocking the boat. Juan.  WILLIAMS: So, in fact, what Bernie Sanders says is true. He won the voters 18 and even under 45, but not by large margins. And to reiterate what Dana just said, they didn't turn out. They didn't turn out.  So, you know, he can go after trade policy, he can go after health care, and a lot of Democrats are going to agree with him, but ultimately, as he said, they don't agree that he is the best candidate to beat Donald Trump.  WATTERS: Right. And it also hurts him when he brings Omar on stage or AOC on stage. And you know, you lose a lot of working-class voters when you go crazy, green new deal extreme. President Trump announcing he's going to be addressing the nation on Coronavirus at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time tonight. Here is the President earlier.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're going to have to do something with respect to getting this -- getting rid of this virus as quickly as possible, and as safely as possible. Our number one -- our number one priority is the health of the people of our country. And so, we will be making most likely a statement. I will be making a statement later on tonight as to what I have decided to do and what our country will be doing.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: It comes as the World Health Organization officially designated the outbreak as a global pandemic due to its spread and severity, cases topping 115,000 in over 100 countries throughout the world. In the U.S., over 1,000 people are infected. Of course, President Trump continuing to face attacks over his handling of the outbreak.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When Coronavirus broke out in China, people said this is China's. It's actually Donald Trump's because there are some things you can't lie and spin your way through above all something like a virus, which is out of control, just as the Soviet government could lie its way through atomic particles going through the air in Ukraine 35 years ago.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It reminds me of Hurricane Katrina, just a failed federal response and failed federal mobilization. They underestimated the challenge.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: Do you think it's fair, Dana, to say that the response to failure? I just don't see the evidence that it has failed.  PERINO: Well, I also think it's fair on the Katrina point.  WATTERS: Yes.  PERINO: But we've argued on that before. One of the things we talked about yesterday is that we have a federal system, so you have state and local governments. And you're supposed to be on the frontline, you are supposed to do the things.  In China, they don't have that. They have a situation out there, authoritarian. They are afraid to tell their leaders bad news. And that's why they lost time. We don't have that problem here. Obviously, people are free to criticize and they are going to.  The burden of leadership is that you are going to get criticized, but it seems to me today that the President was just setting that all aside. He said in that cabinet room meeting with the Wall Street Journal folks -- sorry, the Wall Street folks, he said first and foremost, the only thing I care about right now is the health of the American people. So that's what I'm going to focus on. I'm going to give a speech on that tonight. I do think you will probably hear some additional aggressive measures to try to contain.  We know the mayor of New York has finally canceled the St. Patrick's Day parade just out of an abundance of caution. We know the NCAA games, there's not going to be fans. America is trying to do things that are really smart, but the state and local governments still have a lot to do.  And I think that most of them are trying to be cooperative with the federal government, because they need President Trump and his seem to be helping them.  WATTERS: Right. You can't be too partisan in a pandemic like this. Juan, I found it interesting that the Democrats were knocking the President for the payroll tax proposal. And I did a little research.  And a few years ago under Barack Obama, the Democrats loved the payroll tax, that was their signature thing under Barack Obama. And they said how great of an idea it was. But now when President Trump wants to do it, it is all of a sudden bad.  WILLIAMS: You know, I would love to come with you on those journeys to the library for research. Because I think you need to see a little context.  WATTERS: I will show where it is, you've never been.  WILLIAMS: A terrible recession that we, as an American people, went through in 08. And why he is employing it. But let me just say..  WATTERS: That was in 2010 and 12.  WILLIAMS: Yes, right. We are trying to come out. And I think -- I'm going to stop there.  WATTERS: OK.  WILLIAMS: Believe me, Republicans have been highly critical about stimulus packages and efforts to try to pull America out of a recession. But, anyway, it seems to me that you, Jessie, are confusing really legitimate criticism with a political attack.  WATTERS: Tell me how.  WILLIAMS: Well, one I think the virus is going to attack me where you, Republican, Democrat, independent, male or female, black or white. I just think we got to see it as a common enemy for us all.  And so, I think it's better to pull the politics. But if you are asking me about legitimate criticism, I would say, I don't think we have enough tests, right. We didn't have enough tests. I would say that the President has said it, you know what, calm down. This will go away. We got it under control.  Those are direct quotes. And you know what, not true. And of course, he said, the vaccine, that's coming in a matter of months. And the experts say, it will be a year and a half. Maybe, we don't have a vaccine.  So I think all people are looking for is, trusting the leader, the head of the pack.  WATTERS: Right.  WILLIAMS: And when he does things like that, when he spins, when he goes out, he starts calling names, people are like, whoa.  WATTERS: To Juan's point, I think there is criticism about the availability of the tests and the CDC has to bear responsibility for that. The President has been measured to come, he has been calm. And to say that he hasn't been listening to the experts or he has been downplaying it, I think that's mistaking the President for saying, everybody wash your hands. We're going to get through this. And we will beat this thing. It's not the boom a bubonic plague.  GRACE: Well, I also think that officially declaring it pandemic, which happened today, is going to add fuel to the flames. We already knew it was a pandemic, which is simply it's on every continent. But I think that's going to add a lot to the hysteria. And everyone is going to blame whoever is sitting in the White House, regardless of who it is.  PERINO: Yes.  WATTERS: Are you worried about it?  GRACE: Of course, I am.  WATTERS: How worried are you?  GRACE: I have children. I've got 12 year olds. They just canceled their classes, Friday and Monday. So, yeah, I'm worried. Do I think it they are going to get it? No. I don't if I look statistically at how many people per capita get it. No, I don't. But in here, I'm a mom. That's my number one job. So, yes, of course, I'm worried.  WATTERS: Right. Greg.  GRACE: I want to soak in the minute I leave.  WATTERS: Pour it all over me. Dredge me. Greg, what do you think?  GUTFELD: Look, first of all, I am an excellent babysitter. So if you have any issues --  GRACE: You walked from the green room, you never once washed your hands.  WATTERS: And he touched his face in the open.  GUTFELD: That's true. I'm a walking Petridish, was it petridish? Forget it.  All right. Let's talk about Bret Stephens first, because, you know, I like this fella, but something has gone wrong. The 2016 has been a story of ego damage. People with the largest sense of external self of impact media wise are still reeling from the Trump -- the Trump victory, so they have an inability to look at reality or take an inventory of their own errors. So basically, Trump -- the virus is the nail to the Trump DDS hammer, to everything.  So, at this point, all behavior can be divided into two camps, plus or a minus. If you say Trump can do a better job at the public articulation of this emergency, that's accurate. And it is a plus, right. But to go on TV and say, it's Katrina, especially after having a four-year emotional investment and income based on saying those things, then you are a negative.  Obviously, this is my personal strategy. When you get up in the morning, you have to say, are you going to be a plus or a minus. You got to take some control over your own behavior, right. So do your stuff like you practice your hygiene, self-distancing, and check out the people that are most vulnerable, the relatives that are older than you.  You try to get some control over this to make yourself feel better, especially in times of the unknown. Control means everything. Going on TV - - I mean, I try to practice this. As you know, I'm a very giving person. And I care about everybody, especially the elderly and our viewers especially.  And so, there you go. So I think it's like -- I'm like Juan. I don't want to get involved in the pool to go back and forth. I just want to do the right thing.  WATTERS: Do you think -- I mean, he didn't ask us permission for making that analogy about it. We will that slide.  WILLIAMS: I want to say one thing.  WATTERS: Yes, please.  WILLIAMS: You know, what Greg was talking about is I noticed today and Nancy picked up on this, schools closing, the NBA game, I think the Warriors and the Nets, no audience, right. I think you see now that the St. Patrick's Day parade, as Dana mentioned, and so people are saying groups of more than 250, and in some cases groups of more than a thousand. And I think that much of this is coming from that, that the federal government is not giving clear directions, so the localities are now stepping in and creating their own rules.  GUTFELD: I will tell you why. I think that we realized that the government cannot do everything. And that actually we are kind of in this together. I had to cancel my fan club.  WILLIAMS: Shouldn't the NIH -- you know, the experts, who are the people at the top, just as they are working with the pharmaceutical industry, the insurance agencies, they could give us direction.  GRACE: But I think they are.  GUTFELD: The event industry is getting hit hard, right -- the event industry. So that's everything there because they're dealing with mass groups. I think they would be criticized if they hadn't acted on this.  WATTERS: Right. Today, the Coronavirus canceled its Coronavirus concert.  GUTFELD: Yes, it's true.  PERINO: Do you think...  GUTFELD: The View had no audience, Dana. They're used to that. But, I mean, they had an audience there.  PERINO: I was losing my train of thought because that was a good one. Once, the President put Vice President Pence in charge. He has done I think a really good job. He's out there every single day. They're communicative. They take questions for as long as -- they exhaust the questions in the briefing room. And then, Gavin Newsom, the governor of California saying he's on the phone hourly with federal officials.  And remember, it is a federal system. So your state and local governments are the ones that will make these decisions. The President can't say unless it was in the most extreme circumstance, I am canceling Ella's Elementary School in Denver, Colorado, tomorrow. That would be absurd. We say why would you do that? You have state and local control for a reason. They have to do their jobs. That's why we have those elections.  I think the federal government, aside from the testing thing, which is something they are going to have to do, they are trying to get on top of it now, but it does look like that was a big problem.  WATTERS: And I don't believe that the federal government has recommended these local schools closed.  PERINO: No.  WATTERS: This is something these localities are doing to I think make everyone feel safer and that's on them. That's not what the President and his team have in mind.  WILLIAMS: No. but it's like the containment that we have here in New York in New Rochelle. The federal government didn't do that, the state government did that.  GRACE: But that's the right thing.  WILLIAMS: But I'm saying that if you have experts of the top who can say to you, you know, we are figuring out that the elderly, not so much the young. So here is our advice with regard to schools, or we are figuring out how this could spread in a crowd. And here's what we think about big basketball games or your conference of bakers.  PERINO: But don't you think that what they've done -- this morning in the testimony he said, I would not go to a crowded event. If I were older -- so I actually think they are doing it. Now, I think the way that people are getting their information is too diffuse but they are talking.  WILLIAMS: Yes, if it was direct.  PERINO: How can it be more direct?  WILLIAMS: I think tonight. I, by the way, salute President Trump for speaking up. I think he is going to speak tonight. I hope they vet that speech very carefully and that he delivers very clear messages that inspires confidence in the American people.  WATTERS: OK. And we will tonight at 9:00 p.m. Eastern for the President to address the nation.  Up next, major Hollywood creep Harvey Weinstein headed to the big house. We will tell you what he said in court today.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WILLIAMS: Welcome back. We want you to know that President Trump will be addressing the nation at 9 p.m. Eastern on the Coronavirus outbreak. More on that coming up later.  But first, disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein learning his fate today in a New York City courtroom. He was sentenced to 23 years in prison for rape and sexual assault. Lawyers for Weinstein are saying the sentence is too harsh. Take a lesson.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONNA ROTUNNO, HARVEY WEINSTEIN'S LAWYER: Total unfairness and a complete lack of acknowledgment of what the facts and evidence of this case actually showed. I think the judge took things into consideration that never should have been taken into consideration.  Of course, it's too harsh, it's ridiculous. Harvey feels terrible. Of course, he does. This is not an easy day.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: All right. So, Nancy, we want to go with you first. We know you have a brand-new show on Fox Nation called a Crime Stories. Tell us a little about that.  GRACE: Crime Stories covers the crime and justice needs of the day. We highlight missing people -- missing person cases, especially children, unsolved homicides, and also cold cases that need attention. And of course, we've been on Weinstein since the get-go. And I can't believe his lawyers got up -- even though I know her, she's a pretty good lawyer, and whined that this was unfair. He got 23 years, he could have gotten much, much more than that. And frankly, I'm surprised he only got 23.  WILLIAMS: Well, hang on, hang on because I want to ask you a subsequent question on this, because they make the point that he is an old man, likely to die in jail. He can't walk they say, he's lost his livelihood. He had a historic fall from grace.  GRACE: Whose fault is that?  WILLIAMS: Hang on, hang on.  GUTFELD: He did feel from grace.  WILLIAMS: He was a powerful guy.  GRACE: I think he said in court now he wants to help others.  WILLIAMS: All right.  GRACE: He wants to get back.  WILLIAMS: Here's the thing. The prosecutor said there have been dozens of allegations against him, dating from the 70s, a pattern of disdain and inhumanity on his part. The judge then says the evidence of these other incidences of sexual assault are legitimate consideration for sentencing. And I thought to myself, he wasn't convicted of that?  GRACE: Hold on. Hold your horses because other incidents were before the judge's purview. And they were called similar transactions in cases that are so similar to the case in chief if they are allowed in evidence.  And remember the judge also knows -- I mean, when I go to a sentencing, the judge has a file. In that file, he has the rap sheet. He's got everything you could imagine. So the judge knows a lot that the jury doesn't know.  WILLIAMS: But he was never convicted of anything else.  GRACE: Yes, that's true. But even on the charges for which he was convicted, he could still have gotten more than 23 years. It's not working.  WILLIAMS: No, no, no.  GRACE: And another thing, they have already talked about an appeal. You know what, bring it on. Because if they're going to appeal that the sentences to light, that's not going anywhere. Because this sentence that this judge, Judge Burke, handed down wasn't within statutory parameters.  PERINO: If they appeal and lose, could he get more time?  GRACE: Wishful thinking. Sadly, the Constitution doesn't work that way.  WILLIAMS: Well, but he could get more time. He's got a case coming up in L.A.  GRACE: Yes, for four accounts. And listen to this one.  WILLIAMS: OK.  GRACE: In one of the camps of these two ladies, four counts, her outcry witness which is, under the law, the first person, molestation or rape victim speaks to, is a priest. Good luck cross-examining him for the defense. I can't wait.  WILLIAMS: Dana, what did you take away from the sentencing?  PERINO: Well, I was kind of focused on Bernie Sanders and the race today, so I was a little bit late on this one. I assumed he was going to have to go to jail. And I know when they said he's older, he should be able to stay at home, well -- there's a lot of old people there in jail. And there are people like get caught and get in trouble and have to maybe go there, yet, it's super unpleasant. But what he's convicted of is even more unpleasant for those women who are innocent. So, so what?  WILLIAMS: So what?  PERINO: Yeah.  WILLIAMS: So, Jesse, you know, it strikes me that this took a long time for justice to be delivered. But on the other hand, you know, he's sitting there and he's saying, you know what, this isn't fair to me. I didn't do it. How do you understand this?  WATTERS: Well, he's an ugly man who abused his power for sex. But there's not just one Harvey. There's lots of them out there. And women all over should blow the whistle. And I don't care if they settle. I don't care if they want to go to trial. That's on them.  But the days of praying for decades on women, pretty much over if you look at Weinstein, Cosby, R. Kelly, and Jeffrey Epstein. Those guys are either dead, behind bars, awaiting trial, but they're not a threat to women anymore.  WILLIAMS: So it's sending a message.  WATTERS: When you prey on this many women for this long of a time, it makes the job of prosecutors so much easier, because then they can pick from the dozens of cases and try the easiest one to get the -- to get the guilty verdict. So it doesn't matter how rich you are or how powerful you are, if you do this, the long arm of a wall will find you. What's upsetting though, is that it took so long because --  GRACE: He's just thanking them.  WATTERS: All of the entourage around a guy like this, whether they're lawyers or they're thugs, you know, they silence people with money, they threaten them verbally or physically, so they don't speak up. If you can charge these people in a conspiracy or something like that, I would like to see that. Because there's a lot of people also responsible for what Harvey did.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You know what, you want to tell me that Harvey Weinstein's assistants and secretaries and enablers didn't know what was happening? They would lure these girls in under the guise of an interview. They knew what was going on.  WILLIAMS: Right. So Greg, yes, you've heard of Stockton to Malone. You know, John Stockton, Karl Malone basketball where he feeds in the ball and he dunks it.  GRACE: I mean, I know that.  GUTFELD: Such a racist comment. It's like I would know basketball.'  WILLIAMS: I knew that you would know that. All right, so anyway, I have a Stockton to Malone for you. I want to feed you this and I want you to dunk it.  GUTFELD: OK.  WILLIAMS: Because today, again, I was struck by the idea that NBC did nothing with this story. When we talk about Jesse saying how long it took, why did NBC sit on this story?  GUTFELD: Well, a couple of things. One, you mentioned the word entourage, that's too limiting. It's bigger -- you included the entourage in the entirety of Hollywood, the media, anybody that has some kind of power that Harvey Weinstein could tap into, and they could tap back. So he had his fingers and a lot of stuff that allowed him to get away with this.  People should be interviewing the people who defended him, the actors, and the actresses, and the producers, and the industry bigwigs to find out what's going on. Because frankly, in two months, he's a friend of Hillary, he's going to be suicided in about two months. So you got to get to him soon before she -- not she -- whoever it gets him.  And lastly, lastly, Weinstein, is a horrible person, but he camouflaged his horribleness with virtue signaling through feminist causes, and his own pro-women movies. He had the pig pass. The pig pass allows you to get away with everything because you're progressive in appearance, and then a pig when you get somebody alone.  And everything -- the thing is so many people knew about it that Tom Cruise played a character based on him in Pineapple -- was a Pineapple Express?  PERINO: Yes.  GUTFELD: Yes. Was it?  PERINO: I don't know.  GUTFELD: What's it with -- when Robert Downing wears black vest.  WATTERS: Thunder --  GUTFELD: Tropic Thunder.  WATTERS: Tropic Thunder.  GUTFELD: Tropic Thunder. So it was -- it was a well-known enough thing that Tom Cruise actually played a version of him, so they knew.  WATTERS: Pig pass. Pig pass.  PERINO: Is there a movie called Pineapple Express?  GUTFELD: Yes, it's actually a (INAUDIBLE). I got confused.  WATTERS: All right, gentle people, President Trump will be addressing the nation tonight at 9:00 p.m. Eastern on the coronavirus. The latest on this pandemic when THE FIVE comes right back. Stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PERINO: Welcome back. President Trump is set to address the nation from the Oval Office tonight at 9:00 p.m. Eastern on the coronavirus. That comes after the World Health Organization officially designated the outbreak as a global pandemic. The head of that organization saying that officials made the decision because they're worried about the alarming levels of spread and severity.  Meanwhile, coronavirus cases here in America are now exceeding 1,000. Here's President Trump sounding off on a possible stimulus plan to help the economy.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If we get rid of the problem quickly, everything solves itself. We don't need stimulus. So that'd be good. But we are talking about various forms of stimulus. I think the payroll tax would be great. Democrats are not in favor of it. I've tried to figure out why because it would be something that would be very good for the citizens, for the people, and even longer-term for the country. So that's a tax that people have long been talking about either cutting or getting rid of entirely.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: I think one of the reasons that the President is taking this action tonight to have the speech is because not only just the pandemic, but also the steps on the economy. But also this from Dr. Anthony Fauci about his concerns about how it could get worse.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: We will see more cases and things will get worse than they are right now. How much worse we'll get will depend on our ability to do two things to contain the influx of people who are infected coming from the outside, and the ability to contain and mitigate within our own country. Bottom line, it's going to get worse.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: So Greg, Juan was talking earlier about the government needing to speak more directly, but I feel like that's pretty direct and transparent.  GUTFELD: Yes, yes, it's pretty sobering. You know, it's weird. It's like we human beings are mirroring the stock market. One day you get up you feel hey, it's going to be good, then the next day you feel down. It's like 1000 points up, 1000 points down. If the stock market, the investors realize that they're overreacting in one day enough to correct it the next day, why are you giving everybody this headache? You know what I mean? Just kind of like mellow out a little bit.  Why can't we have a stock market holiday. You know, it's like watching -- the stock market right now is watching a guy playing blackjack who isn't allowed to leave even during a bad streak. You're at least allowed to leave about -- you're allowed to leave a bad streak. Even if you don't - we don't have stock market on Christmas, do we?  PERINO: No, not on holidays.  GUTFELD: Not on Thanksgiving and not on holidays, so why don't we have a stock holiday?  WATTERS: It's called the weekend.  PERINO: Well, after 9/11 they did do that for a while.  GUTFELD: I think --  PERINO: They shut it down for a little bit just to give everybody some breathing space.  GUTFELD: So I accidentally barreled into a good idea.  PERINO: I don't know. I think that -- I think that might be -- is it too severe, right?  GUTFELD: I don't think it's severe at all, Dana. How dare you accuse me of being severe.  WATTERS: Yes, let's shut the markets down, Greg.  GUTFELD: Just do it.  PERINO: Sorry, I'm just --  WATTERS: I think the President --  GUTFELD: I'm not an economist, OK. I come up with ideas.  WATTERS: OK. Well, you don't mind.  PERINO: And the other thing that they did, Jesse, they had the Wall Street folks in today talking about how the banks can help people. The banks are not in distress. People could be in distress if they aren't able to go to their jobs or hold their conferences and things like that. But the other thing they did is they talked to the healthcare company CEOs yesterday and they got them to agree to not make people pay for co-payments and other items related to their care if they get coronavirus.  WATTERS: I was happy to hear from the bank CEOs today. They said the country is strong. The banks are strong. There's liquidity. They're able to lend to businesses that are in trouble and they're able to help the consumer as they can. The President's going to go out there and talk tonight about bringing the country together, Democrats and Republicans, to get some sort of stimulus in place to make sure the markets are calm, and the people and industries that need help get it.  But the markets are reacting to news. For instance, when this Fauci guy comes out and says this coronavirus is 10 times more lethal than the flu. And then later he says, and the death rate is one percent, not three percent which we thought it was three weeks ago, it's one percent. So the death rates going down but the media, they bury the good news and they put up the news 10 times deadlier than the flu. That's why --  GUTFELD: But it's the same thing.  WATTERS: Right. But the most important thing to realize is that it's less deadly than we think it is not as deadly as we thought three weeks ago, and that does have an effect on people. I was in Starbucks today. You know what they're doing?  GRACE: Oh, you paid $5.00 to get a cup of coffee?  WATTERS: Yes, I know. I know. I'm a yappy.  GRACE: Have you tried McDonald's?  PERINO: Have you seen his hair?  WATTERS: I'm a big yappy.  GRACE: You got to go to McDonald's, man.  WATTERS: They're taking now those drinks of the coffee and the almond milk and all that stuff in the community section. They got rid of it. They have to add -- they have to put the coffee in there for you. So people are -- people are changing their ways.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: For instance, I was in an Uber today.  GUTFELD: No, not really.  WATTERS: The guy rolls his window down. That never happens.  GUTFELD: That's true.  WATTERS: And you know, people are starting to (INAUDIBLE) the gym.  PERINO: Why don't you take the subway?  GRACE: And you're trying to blame that on coronavirus?  WATTERS: I didn't take subway, Dana, for another reason and you know why.  PERINO: I took the subway today.  WATTERS: Oh, you're so much braver than I am.  PERINO: Well, also I was like running out of time. The concern for our healthcare workers that they could get overwhelmed. So the fact -- people aren't just in hospitals with a whole bunch of empty beds sitting around. But if we have a lot of people that need beds, that's the concern. So, Grace, tell me about -- like, I think you're from Atlanta, right?  GRACE: Yes.  PERINO: What's it like down there? Because that's where the CDC is --  GRACE: Big concern, big concern. The airport is thinning out. Everybody's wearing a mask. I noticed the same thing at LaGuardia. But I think that Trump has got to walk a very fine line. I'll tell you why. I know the stats. I can read, although they didn't teach math in law school, sadly. But if it happens to you, then those stats don't mean (INAUDIBLE).  And when you're putting your children at school, and the mall or the karate class, or whatever they're doing, that's a concern to me. So we can't poopoo it. It's a very fine --  GUTFELD: Watch your language.  GRACE: Thank you.  PERINO: Juan, what do you think about the possibility of doing something like a payroll tax cut, or should there be something else that the President thinks about in terms of stimulus to help these industries get through what it could be a difficult time?  WILLIAMS: Well, I think we've got to do something. I mean, obviously, we -- I mean, you talk about the cruise ship industry, but you've also been got to think about all the other conferences. We -- I could go on. I mean, obviously, professional sports, so much is going to be impacted by this, hotels and --  GRACE: You haven't even mentioned the courthouses.  WILLIAMS: Why should I mention the courthouses?  GRACE: The courthouses. Everybody is at the courthouse breathing on each other.  GUTFELD: Can you get out a jury?  PERINO: Well, a lot of cruise ships are foreign --  GRACE: Brilliant.  WILLIAMS: But I must say, you know, you know, I say, let's not be political. And what does he do? He goes out there and starts attacking Democrats over a stimulus plan that would last just long enough that would be in November at the time of the election, then it's gone.  WATTERS: So let's extend it. Let's make it two years.  PERINO: OK. No more, no more payroll tax cut. I'm just kidding, kidding. All right, President Trump, as we mentioned, he's going to address the nation tonight from the Oval Office at 9:00 p.m. Eastern --  GUTFELD: It's only on Fox News.  PERINO: -- on the coronavirus. What to expect, next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PERINO: All right, President Trump is set to deliver an oval office address to the nation tonight at 9:00 p.m. Eastern. This will be on the coronavirus. President Trump is expected to outline his plan to fight the pandemic. John Roberts joins us from the White House for a preview. John?  JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good afternoon to you Dana. You know, the President said when he was in that meeting with the bankers this afternoon that he's made a number of decisions today and that there were a couple of other decisions that he was going to make after that meeting as well, and that he would talk to us all about that tonight at 9:00.  One of the decisions that the President may have to do with extending travel advisories or even travel restrictions to some areas of the world. Certainly, the coronavirus really has exploded throughout Europe, so that could form a part of it. There also could be some news on the financial stimulus front. There is no actual plan at the moment unless they're cobbling something together quite quickly.  The President believes there's a number of things that he could do administratively to help out small businesses, to help out people with paid leave, people who have been laid off, maybe extending unemployment insurance benefits, things like that.  The big one that the President wants to go after, and that is, at the very least, a temporary elimination of the payroll tax that is paid every week by employees across the country, 12.4 percent when you add up the employer and the employee contribution for Social Security. That would have to be done through Congress.  The President has also made no secret of the fact that he would like to do that on a permanent basis as well. But there seems to be very little appetite to do it in Congress even on a temporary basis, let alone a permanent basis.  So I think, you know, a lot of what we're going to hear is decisions that he's taken in terms of trying to keep the country safe from the virus, try to mitigate the spread of the disease, as well as what he plans to do financially to make sure that the economy stays healthy.  Democrats have criticized him, Dana, for focusing on corporate America over individuals in this country, focusing on the economy rather than the health of Americans. But, you know, you've got to keep the people healthy, but you also have to keep the economy healthy, because if you don't, that's going to create its own set of problems.  PERINO: All right, John Roberts at the White House, we'll see you again at 9:00. Thank you so much. You can do both things. You can take care of the economy and -- or try to help the economy and take care of --  GUTFELD: We have a great free market. It's decentralized. So when one sector gets hit, another sector rises. It's resilient. It moves like this. But you know what's better than fear? Service. Doing something for someone else gives you a sense of control, right? Trying to help out a relative gives you a sense of control. So you can do something.  PERINO: Help people out. Any thoughts, Jesse, before we let you go?  WATTERS: You're letting me go.  PERINO: No. We're going to have ""ONE MORE THING"" today. It's our first time since the whole week.  WATTERS: No. I think Wall Street is going to react to what this plan they're going to cook together in Congress is going to be and they're reacting to the numbers. Once these numbers start peaking and then come down, you'll see the market start to normalize.  PERINO: All right, we'll get all of our ""ONE MORE THING"" up next.  GUTFELD: Will we? I hope so.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: All right, go to Fox Nation. I got a great interview with Burgess Owens, NFL great. We talked about politics. He's running for Congress. If you miss this, it's on you. Now let's do this quickly.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Animals are great. Animals are great. Animals are great.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Now more than ever, I think I'm the real hero here. We haven't had a good Animals are Great in a week now. Check out this little fellow. Even in times of struggle, you can find a little dog having a good time with a balloon. Yes, isn't that nice, you know? That's what you got to be. Wake up every morning and find that little balloon and hit it with your nose.  WATTERS: We waited all week for this, Greg?  GUTFELD: Yes, we did. It's just a little break from everything else. And anyway, that dog is a hero. All right, Nancy, you're up. Can you fall -- can you top a dog in a balloon?  GRACE: Yes, as a matter of fact, I think I can. We just launched ""CRIME STORIES"" on Fox Nation. Big primary right now, $0.99 for the first month for new subscribers. And I had on a mom Kathy Miller. We've been trying to solve the cold case of her son. Little bitty kid (INAUDIBLE) who was gunned down on his way to a 7-Eleven to get candy.  I believe a white male tried to lure him into a car. He wouldn't go and he was killed. Already are getting information after our first Fox Nation program. OK, so I think that top the balloon and the dog,  GUTFELD: I will -- I will discuss that later. We'll manage --  GRACE: Yes. Bring it on.  WATTERS: $0.99.  GUTFELD: Dana?  PERINO: Well, welcome to Fox Nation, and Fox, and THE FIVE.  GRACE: Thank you.  PERINO: All right, I've been wanting to do this all week. Stop looking at my paper.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: This is -- OK, Irish president Michael Higgins, he was hosting an event for International Women's Day on Sunday, and his Bernese Mountain dog barged in, and he was like, where's my dad, where's my dad? He's at this big event. He's like looking all over for his dad. His name is Brod. And that's kind of interesting.  GUTFELD: For Women's Day? Why is that funny, Dana?  PERINO: I don't know. I don't know. Anyway, he found his dad and got a couple of belly pads and I thought that was so cute. That was even better than Prince William and Kate's royal visit.  GUTFELD: Was that a female dog?  PERINO: His name is Brod. I don't know.  GUTFELD: Well, I'm just saying.  PERINO: It's a boy dog.  GUTFELD: This is an offensive story. Especially on Women's Day, Dana, you make me sick. Juan?  WILLIAMS: All right. So you know what, I'm going to let this video talk for itself. Just take a look at this incredible scene. A 23-year-old British skier comes across a stunning surprise while heading downhill at a resort in the French Alps. Yes, it's a 19-year-old woman buried in two feet of snow. She was running short on oxygen, getting panicky, unable to push herself out with her arms.  So guess what. The woman suffered no injuries, fortunately. Thanks to the sharp-eyed skier who saw her, stopped, and with human compassion rescued her well.  WATTERS: Where was this?  WILLIAMS: In the French -- in the French Alps.  GUTFELD: Who's filming it? Why would the guy filming it help? That's what I always ask. You could have gotten her twice as fast if you put the camera down.  WATTERS: You don't know how much he got paid for that video, Greg.  GUTFELD: Do you think it's real?  WATTERS: You think it's a fake rescue?  GUTFELD: I don't know. Fake rescue is a great idea.  WATTERS: We're going to look into it.  GUTFELD: Fake rescue.  WATTERS: It's going to be on Fox nation.  GUTFELD: All right, Jesse.  WATTERS: OK, we haven't done this in a while. Jesse's hair news.  GUTFELD: Fantastic.  WATTERS: Why did you do that? Look at that. It moves, everybody. All right, so Minnesota High School state championships for hockey. Look at the lettuce on these guys.  GUTFELD: Nice.  WATTERS: We got one, that's a lot of cabbage right there. What do we got it here? Carrot top almost. How about --  GUTFELD: (INAUDIBLE)  WATTERS: Here's the quarterback. What's going on with that guy?  PERINO: Wow.  WATTERS: Business in the front, party at -- and my man. I don't know his name, but that's a great cut. Look at these guys. They're all going pro. Greg, you could learn a lot from this.  GRACE: There's a lot of guys --  WATTERS: Look at the stache. Yes, that's right.  GUTFELD: They're all going to be bald in 10 years.  GRACE: Enjoy it while it last.  WATTERS: All right, also I'm on Martha MacCallum tonight. ""WEDNESDAY S WITH WATTERS,"" that's 7:0 Eastern.  GUTFELD: Good for you. All right, well, that was quite a show. Set your DVRs, never miss an episode of THE FIVE. ""SPECIAL REPORT"" is up next.  Hello, Bret.  BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: That was quite a show.

52,FOX,"As other countries endure chaos as coronavirus spreads from one travel hub to the next, Bernie Sanders says that preventing such spread would be racist. If you want to see the deadly impact of the progressive mind, watch Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., in the Fox News town hall held Monday night. In it, the candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination said he wouldn't have shut down our borders to protect Americans from the coronavirus or a similar epidemic, because that would be racist. ""We have a president who has propagated a xenophobic, anti-immigrant sentiment from before he was elected,"" Sanders said. ""What we need to do is have the scientists take a hard look at what we need to do. There are communities where the virus is spreading. What does that mean? It may mean self-quarantining. It may be not having public assemblies. But let's not go back to the same old thing. Isn't it interesting that a president who has been demagoguing and demonizing immigrants, the first thing that he could even think about is closing down the border?"" SANDERS TELLS FOX NEWS TOWN HALL HE WOULDN'T CLOSE US BORDERS DURING CORONAVIRUS-TYPE CONTAGION Imagine how clueless you have to be to say that. As other countries endure chaos due to the virus spreading from one travel hub to the next, here you have a leading Democrat who suggests that such prevention is racist. Toward the Chinese and Italians, somehow. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Italians locked themselves down, you idiot. Even for a leftist, Bernie's behind the times. By now, those who called President Trump a racist for blocking travel have already changed their tune to a new smear. Because it worked, they say: ""He didn't do it fast enough."" It exposes their punitive politics as the designation of “oppressor” versus “oppressed” creates suspicion in all relationships, including black-white, gay-straight, and male-female — undermining cooperation and community, which prevents action that would reduce death. How can you expect to fight any threat, be it a virus or a world war, if your leader wants you to fight each other? CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It's funny how Bernie thought it was so noble to say he'd make a vaccine free ""once"" it was available. Why not make it available now? As if things magically appear before the socialists take control of distribution. Take it from me.

53,FOX,"Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden exchanges heated words with factory worker in Michigan; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" March 10, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  CHARLES PAYNE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: I think it was the ultimate test, not bad. Gary, thank you very much. Again, you can see, folks, DOW up 1,100 points, one of the biggest point gains in history. ""THE FIVE"" is next.  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino, along with Katie Pavlich, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It is 5:00 in New York City, and this is THE FIVE. Joe Biden curses out a blue collar worker in Michigan while voters head to the polls for Super Tuesday 2.0. That video coming up later, but first, 352 delegates in six states are up for grabs tonight.  Joe Biden with a big opportunity to build what could be an insurmountable delegate lead against Bernie Sanders in the fight for the Democratic nomination. And while the former vice president surges. His campaign is cutting down on the length of his speeches after another round of gaffes. Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're going to unite this party and unite this country. The folks want to nominate a Democrat, a life-long Democrat, a proud Democrat, an Obama-Biden Democrat. Join us. We cannot get -- re-elect -- we cannot win this re-election -- excuse me. We can only re- elect Donald Trump. If in fact, we get engaged in this circular firing squad.  Together, I think we can win back the House -- we're going to keep the House. Increase it. And flip the Senate. We talked about that. We're going to win back the United States Senate.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: While Bernie Sanders is shying away from directly attacking Biden over his campaign slip-ups, he is saying this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  BERNIE SANDERS (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: When give I speech, often it is 45 minutes or an hour, OK? Because there are a lot of challenges that the country faces, and I have got to talk about them. You know, I think Joe was somewhere -- where was he, I don't know, Michigan or someplace else the other day? And he spoke for seven minutes. I don't know how you say anything other than, you know, minimal discussion in seven minutes.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: So both of the candidates have cancelled their events for tonight, citing Coronavirus as a concern. They're going to be in Ohio. That's where the voting will take place next week when there's another Super Tuesday. Katie, what about this Biden and Bernie thing about how long their speeches are?  KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, I think that he has a point, Bernie Sanders, in the sense that -- look, we're trying to talk about deep issues or trying to determine why we're different from each other, why voters should vote for us based on our policies. And it's very difficult in seven minutes to lay out your entire platform as a moderate Democrat and distinguishing yourself from someone like Bernie Sanders.  Now, whether Bernie Sanders is saying anything new, meaning how is he actually going to pay for things and getting into the details of what his policy proposals really mean for Americans is a different story. But Joe Biden being taken off the campaign trail, in the sense of being limited in his time, is not a good look when he's trying to make the argument that he's the one who can beat President Trump who can speak for hours on end without stopping and without a teleprompter.  PERINO: Juan, do you think that much ado about nothing? And also, what do you think about tonight? Because four years ago, Bernie Sanders had a very good night in these particular states, especially Michigan, Missouri, Washington State. But tonight, Biden is in the lead in some places, and certainly on Bernie Sanders' heels.  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, on the whole business about the attacks on his competence, I just -- I find it offensive. I'm a little stunned. But I see that this is President Trump's, you know, line of attack against Joe Biden of late. And I just think --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: What about Biden -- I mean Bernie Sanders going after --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: No. In fact, last night, Bret and Martha, at the town hall, asked him about it. And he said he wouldn't do it. And I think that some of his own backers, Dana, have been critical of him for not really taking down his opponents, including Joe Biden. But he's not buying in. And I think most Democrats -- not only do they see it as Joe Biden that they have known forever and ever and is sort of charming and authentic and Uncle Joe and all that.  But I think, secondly, they see this as sort of base, personal politics, that, you know --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: What about the results for tonight?  WILLIAMS: But tonight, I think -- look, if you were a betting lady, you would say oh, boy, I'll put all my money -- all my chips on Joe Biden, except for western states. So if you're looking at Idaho and Washington, I think it's in Idaho that you -- that Biden is up, but within the margin of error in Washington. Sanders is up, but again, within the margin of error.  Everywhere else, we're looking at Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, and then there's one exception. But those are clearly, heavily, right now all the polls show for Joe Biden. The one exception I was going to say is there's something, you know, for people out of the country, Democrats abroad. And at the moment, that seems to be on Sanders' side. They could have voted early. But it's not significant in terms of the delegate allotment.  PERINO: The one thing, Jesse, is that Hillary Clinton did really badly four years ago in these states. And she constantly comes back out and she talks about her books and the documentaries and shows she's in the people's consciousness, Joe Biden already doing better than Hillary Clinton.  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: I mean, but at least, Hillary's staff didn't hide her. They're already hiding Biden. He should be fresh by now. This guy is in the home stretch in October. He's going to have to do two to three events a day. He's going to have to do debate prep, fund raisers, TV interviews. And the guy's already winded. He's saying things like AR-15.  He's running for the Senate -- AR-14, that he's confusing family members. He doesn't know if he's in Iowa or if he's in Ohio. This is not good. And now, he's negotiating with the Sanders team so he gets to sit for the debate. They don't want him standing for two hours one-on-one. They want him to sit. So they made Donald Trump take a cognitive test, because he tweeted fake news after midnight a few times.  And he passed with flying colors. They're talking about the 25th Amendment, you know, pulling the hook on him. Joe's brain should be fair game. And that's the bottom line. And Bernie Sanders, he needs to go for the jugular. Because to act like something is all right there, that's not good enough. He did it with Hillary with her e-mails. We don't care about your damn e- mails, Hillary.  And he's doing it again. It's like a guy, a boxer in the late rounds. He's down on all the judge's score cards. He needs a knockout. And he's still dancing around, jabbing. Bernie has got to hit him on stamina. He has got to hit him on the gaffes. He has got to hit him on family corruption. He has to go hard, because if he doesn't do something big to change the trajectory of the race, it's over.  PERINO: And I'm going to have -- I have a little prediction. I think that if Biden does really well tonight, that he will move to say he doesn't need to debate Sunday at all, regarding sitting or standing.  WILLIAMS: I don't think he has to choice. I think he has to do it.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: -- in response to what Jesse just said. I think that Joe Biden's secret was on TV and had an extensive interview last night.  WATTERS: I didn't see that.  (CROSSTALK)  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: GUTFELD: No, I'm good. Let's just go to break.  PERINO: Look, it happens to me all the time.  GUTFELD: New nickname, new nickname, Hiding Biden. There you go. That sticks. Look, last week was Super Tuesday, this week, Stuper Tuesday. You have a choice between a man who has been wrong his entire life on the core issues of our time, or a decent guy who is experiencing easily identifiable cognitive decline. You might find that offensive, but it is accurate.  One is a socialist who has been wrong and one is experiencing cognitive decline. It is there for everybody to see. The solution for this is you're going to support Joe Biden, because he still wears the comfy sweater of American capitalism, not the failed hair shirt of socialism. So what are you counting on? Joe Biden's VP choice, which will be Kamala Harris or Amy Klobuchar who will inherit the office in probably a year.  If Biden wins, they will be president. So here's the greatest analogy you'll hear today. For a Democrat, this election is like buying a house, not for the structure, but for the land. Because if Joe wins, you're going to tear down the house, but you still get the lot, in which you erect the Kamala Harris or the Amy Klobuchar presidency. You're welcome.  PERINO: You heard it here. You heard it here. And Cory Booker is out there.  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: He's out there. He's enthusiastic. VP choices are really important this time, Katie?  PAVLICH: Especially if Joe Biden is the nominee, absolutely. And it's going to interesting to look at how Democrats demand a far left candidate to be the vice president, so that the Bernie wing of the party is somehow represented, and whether, you know, moderate Democrats are going to get out and vote for someone like that with that person on the ticket is going to be the question.  I think we should pick up on what you brought up about the debate on Sunday potentially being cancelled. The Biden team is going to have to do a risk assessment here. And this would be the first time that Joe Biden is on stage by himself. He doesn't have the other candidates to shield him from having to make lengthy statements --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: -- delegate lead. But why do you think, Juan that he has to debate?  WILLIAMS: I don't there's any question. It would be playing to exactly the kind of, you know, offensive thinking that is so prevalent now as a result of the president's behavior.  PERINO: But if you want to win --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: -- the behavior began on your side.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: By the way, I think that people have said things like this about President Trump. And I have never engaged in such chat. I don't think anybody --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: -- and his stability --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: -- of Joe Biden --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: -- you read his mind everyday. You knew what he was thinking.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Look, tonight you have a situation where, as Dana pointed out, Sanders won Michigan in 16 -- it's a 70 percent white electorate. Heavy -- I think a third of the electorate is white, non-college educated. These are Sanders voters in other states. And if he doesn't do something here, there's just -- it's almost like, you know, the rest of the party is going to be pretty quiet.  PERINO: We had something else to bring to you. There was a very nice moment at the White House just moments ago. President Trump presenting the Medal of Freedom to retired four-star Army General Jack Keane for his service to the country. It's the nation's highest civilian honor. General Keane, of course, as you know him well, he's a Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst.  It was wonderful to see that moment there for him. Coming up next on THE FIVE, Democrats have been quick to attack the president over the Coronavirus. But would their plans to stop it be any better? Hear Greg's take on that next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: You just groaned. If you want to see the deadly impact of the progressive mind, watch Bernie from last night's Fox News town hall. There he said he wouldn't have shutdown our borders to protect Americans from disease, you know, because that would be racist.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you had to, would you close down the borders?  SANDERS: No. I mean, what you don't want to do right now -- we have a president who has a propagated, a xenophobic, anti-immigrant sentiment, from before he was elected. What we need to do is have the scientists take a hard look at what we need to do. There are communities where the virus is spreading. What does that mean? It may mean self-quarantining. It may be not having public assemblies.  But let's not go back to the same old thing. Isn't it interesting that a president who has been demagoguing and demonizing immigrants the first thing that he can think about is closing down the border.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Imagine how clueless you have got to be to say that, as other countries endure chaos due to virus spread from one travel hub to the next. Here you have a leading Democrat saying that preventing such spread would be racist against Chinese and Italians, somehow. Italians locked themselves down, you idiot. You've heard the phrase fiddling while Rome burned.  Bernie has got his head up his ass while his hair burns, safety first, Bernie. Even for a leftist, Bernie is behind the times. By now, those who call Trump racist for blocking travel have already changed their tune to a new smear, because it worked. Now, it's he didn't do it fast enough. It exposes their punitive politics as the designation of oppressor versus oppressed creates suspicion in all relationships.  Black, white, gay, straight, male, female, undermining cooperation in community, which prevents action to reduce death. How can you expect to fight any threat, be it or a virus or world war, if your leader wants you to fight each other? Funny how Bernie thought it was so noble to say how he'd make a vaccine free once it was available. I say why not make it available now?  As if things magically appear before the socialist takes control of distribution, take it from me, when a scientist makes a drug that helps the world, a socialist will call him a bigot for taking so long and then smoke it. If we listen to Bernie, Katie, we would be screwed. Because the border action bought time for us to spread out the -- whatever the emergency, the urgent hospital prep and actually make some mistakes.  PAVLICH: Well, you know, how we're being lectured about common sense. Well, shutting down borders during something that is becoming a pandemic is a common sense thing to do. The president did it relatively soon as soon as we knew what China was telling us about the virus in January. He was criticized for doing so. You cannot, as a Democrat or anybody running for office.  Be an advocate for open borders, were you're just allowing thousands of people to come into country un-vetted and then be taken seriously as a candidate for president who should be in charge, who can do a better job than President Trump and his administration has been doing so far. Bernie Sanders talks about scientists.  Everyday, the vice president has been standing up in front of the country and the world with a number of scientists and doctors who have been talking about this disease. And the other thing is now the media is gaslighting everybody, because we call it a Chinese virus or the Wuhan virus. They're saying that that is now racist, which in return allows China to get away with not having any accountability for the way this thing happened.  Oh, can't talk about how this is China's fault because that would be racist, which gives the Communist Party a pass for censoring information, for not getting us the DNA code of the virus soon enough so we can start working on a vaccine, and figuring out how fast it's going to spread, etcetera, etcetera. So this idea that we can't talk about the facts because they're racist now apparently.  It came from China. It's a Chinese virus. We need to deal with it. And also saying that not shutting down borders, but also I should be in charge of preventing the spread of this is just ridiculous and shouldn't be taken seriously.  GUTFELD: At least, the governor of California, Gavin Newsome, actually admitted that what is being done by Trump is essentially good. I think we have this tape.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We had a private conversation, but he said we're going to do the right thing and you have my support, all of our support, logistically and otherwise. He said everything that I could have hoped for. And we had a very long conversation. And every single thing he said, they followed through on. Every single thing, his administration, and it starts at the top, including the vice president has been consistent with the expectation that we repatriate these passengers.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: It's refreshing, Dana, to see some kind of unity among people who are from different political groups.  PERINO: Well, also because -- so we have a federalist system, which means that the state and local governments, they're on the frontlines. So they have to coordinate with the federal government. And if you're Gavin Newsome, you want to fight with President Trump or do you want to get what you need in order to help the people of your state.  I mean, they have -- your economy and all of those things. And I think that when things get this serious and you're doing public health crisis, you can set politics aside if you want to. And in fact, I think also even Governor Inslee of Washington State has backed off of his criticism because they realize that we're all in this together. It's not partisan.  And the public health workers themselves have said that the travel ban from China was actually very helpful, because it have them the time that they needed to prepare. So we -- actually, I think that President Trump could have gone further, right? He could have said no one from South Korea, no one from Iran, initially. But he -- they were prudent and they waited.  And now, it could turn out that it was too late or something, like -- somebody might make that argument. But this is a fast-moving situation. And when you're -- you have the burden of leadership, which means you're going to get criticized, but I think the facts will end up telling the full story.  GUTFELD: Yeah. Jesse, it is -- Bernie does have the luxury of his decisions not mattering.  WATTERS: You can't trust Bernie Sanders. You're talking about Bernie Sanders. It's like an arsonist as your fire chief. You don't want someone that starts fires. You want someone that puts them out. You're talking about an international health scare, and he wants to take away everyone's' healthcare? He wants to vaporize the health insurance industry?  He wants to lock up pharmaceutical executives who are now racing towards finding a vaccine. If you want to open borders during an international pandemic, that's crazy talk. If tightening the borders saves lives, that's a smart thing. That's not racist. It's all rational. Italy did it. They're not racist. They're trying to get a grip on this thing.  When Trump was shutting down the borders and flights from China, the Democrats were impeaching him and they were calling him racist. They have been briefing Congress for two months about this since December. They've been going out forming taskforce. They've pushing forth with new vaccines, quarantines, everything on TV every single day. What do the Democrats want to do differently?  I don't know. I heard Joe answer that on MSNBC last night. Two-minute answer, no clue what his plan was. I had to watch it twice. I still don't know.  GUTFELD: Well, you know, Juan --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Juan, I seem to remember you questioning whether the travel ban was worth while.  WILLIAMS: I do. I still think -- first of all, it's not shutting down our borders. I hear you guys saying that. There's a different between containment, which is someplace like Italy, and someone who is saying I'm going to keep everybody out because I'm worried they're going to bring the disease here. The fact is the disease is already here.  Our issue is no longer about somehow containment. As the surgeon general said yesterday, it's about mitigating the impact of the fact that -- and trying to slow its spread. We have a situation here in New York. They're now containing an area up in New Rochelle. That's not about shutting down. It's trying to contain the spread. That's very different.  So you have a situation where, you know, we had Ebola come in. And then Obama was asked to shut down the borders. And all, of course, the reaction there said -- oh yeah, shut down the borders. Shut down the borders. The medical experts said no. In fact, that would be ineffective and make it more likely that Ebola would spread.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: -- shut it down fast enough.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: -- the fact is that he -- that President Trump knew about this but, was engaged -- it's not going to a big deal. We still hear the same thing.  PAVLICH: Juan, that's so unfair for you to say that. It's not true.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: And of course --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: That was after he shut it down.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: -- that he has sacrificed all his credibility on this issue, because he's engaged in happy thoughts. We're going to have a vaccine in a few weeks.  (CROSSTALK)  PAVLICH: -- to freak out and panic? Should that be what he says, like, yeah, we're all going to be in trouble.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: -- you want somebody to calm you down.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: -- but lying and misinformation, he's just not good at sort of calming us. He's exciting us.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: What's the Democrats' plan, Juan?  WILLIAMS: I think the Democrats' plan is to rely on the scientists.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: -- so Trump is not relying on the scientists.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Oh, you know what? Not a problem, go to work.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: You shut down the border, which was --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: He shut down the Chinese border.  GUTFELD: All right. All right, Joe Biden curses out a voter after being confronted about his second amendment plan. Don't miss it, next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WATTERS: Super Tuesday polls close in just a few couple of hours from now. And Joe Biden's embarrassing himself on the campaign trail again. Here he is actually swearing at a blue collar factory in Michigan after being called out over his gun control plans.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You are actively trying to end the Second Amendment.  BIDEN: You're full of (Inaudible). Hold on. Shush, shush, I support the Second Amendment. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. They're going to take you AR-14's away.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is not OK, all right?  BIDEN: Don't tell me that, pal. I'm going to go outside with you in a minute.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're working for me, man.  BIDEN: I'm not working for you. Give me a break, man. Don't be such a horse's (Inaudible)  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: Wow, Greg. I guess his staff was trying to control him, but he shushed them.  GUTFELD: Was that a female staffer? Shushing a female staffer is a sexist. Sexist, I tell you. I don't know. I can't -- this is going to be a fun time. You know what, he gets mad, he gets cranky. He's like me when I'm hungry all the time. Look, Biden's message is not the party's message. His messages vote for me and I will replace Trump. The party messages vote for Biden and Kamala, or Amy will replace him. Trust me.  WATTERS: You know what, he also lied about not wanting to go after people's guns here. He is admitting it. Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I want to make something clear. I'm going to guarantee you this is not the last you'll see of this guy. You're going to take care of the gun problem with me. You're going to be the one who leads this effort. I'm counting on you.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So to gun owners out there who say well, a Biden administration means they're going to come from my guns.  BIDEN: Bingo. You're right if you have an assault weapon. The fact of the matter is they should be illegal, period.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: All right, so Katie, either he lied or he didn't remember what he said two months ago.  PAVLICH: I don't think Joe Biden would be able to define assault weapons. I'm not sure he knows exactly what his policy would be. But you can look at the people who have endorsed him. Beto, who he said would be in charge of his gun policy, has repeatedly called for the confiscation of constitutionally protected ownership of firearms.  WATTERS: Door to door.  PAVLICH: Door to door by force from the government coming to you and demanding that if you don't turn it in, you will go to prison. Michael Bloomberg has endorsed Joe Biden who has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on gun control efforts all around the country to curtail Second Amendment rights. And it's really interesting to watch Joe Biden in this setting, because these are the kinds of voters that Democrats have to win back, to win places like Michigan and Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.  And they're going to have a very hard time reconciling this woke attitude of gun confiscation to a group of guys like that. There's 50 people standing around them. They all probably feel very similar about the Second Amendment. And also then trying to win back blue-collar workers. It's like putting a square peg in a round hole. This is not going to work. So you can't be for gun confiscation in a crowd like that, a blue-collar workers in the Midwest and think that you're going to win their vote back, especially when President Trump has provided economic policies that they like.  WATTERS: Juan, what if Trump went up to a voter and told him he was full of -- and then told them let's -- you know, let's take this outside?  WILLIAMS: I think you guys would applaud.  WATTERS: Oh, really?  WILLIAMS: Yes. Because you say, hey, you know what, that's Donald Trump. He's being direct. He's being real. You know --  WATTERS: He's being real rude. What do you think about Joe doing that though?  WILLIAMS: I thought, you know what, he's a straight shooter. And by the way, I don't think --  WATTERS: Just not with an AR-15.  WILLIAMS: What you guys are saying is so wrong. Joe Biden, in all those interviews you just saw, said that what he wants to do is not come and confiscate or take away anyone's gun. Governor Whitmer of Michigan just said yesterday --  WATTERS: Didn't he just said that Anderson Cooper?  WILLIAMS: Hang on. No, that's not what he said. What he said was --  WATTERS: He said bingo.  WILLIAMS: -- assault weapons, weapons that pose a threat in terms mass murders of this country which we have a problem with.  PAVLICH: So handgun is fine?  WILLIAMS: But here -- let me finish this point.  WATTERS: Real quick.  WILLIAMS: Because I think that when you think about what Katie was talking about, some strong NRA backer, they weren't going to vote for a Democrat anyway. His stand, Biden's stand is forceful. It helps him with Democrats who say, you deliver a strong message, Joe. You come through strong, I didn't see any dilly-dallying or mental incapacity. No, all of a sudden --  WATTERS: No, AR-14.  WILLIAMS: But I must say, I must say --  WATTERS: Did he get that right?  WILLIAMS: Today, I must say, at this table, I now understand that Joe Biden is the Democratic nominee the way these guys are going after Biden.  WATTERS: He might not make it to be the nominee.  WILLIAMS: Yes, that's your wishful thinking.  WATTERS: What do you think, Dana?  PERINO: Well, I think on the gun thing, it's very interesting that Bernie Sanders used to actually have a pretty nuanced view. He was a supporter of gun rights and that sort of set him apart in the Senate. And I don't exactly know when it changed, but as the party move further left, he moved with them.  And so now that's pretty much party orthodoxy is that the position that Joe Biden is saying that he has now is the one that he thinks can get him to the finish line with for the Democratic nomination. Now, how does that play in a general election? Now for suburban women? Maybe it's better but for those blue-collar workers that were Obama-Trump voters, I don't know that necessarily helps them, get them back.  WATTERS: Maybe he called the guy dog, pony soldier.  GUTFELD: A key to that point. A key difference between -- because you guys were talking about Trump and Biden. I can't recall a single instance of Trump actually aggressively going after individual -- every single one of Joe's tips are with a person, the dog -- when he's talking to somebody, it's going after a person. Trump goes after groups, fake news, the media, that kind of stuff.  WATTERS: Yes, he snaps pretty quickly. All right, we're awaiting another Coronavirus Task Force briefings. Stay with THE FIVE for the latest on the outbreak.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WILLIAMS: Any moment now, we're going to be getting an update on the coronavirus from the task force at the White House. Here's President Trump commenting on the outbreak earlier today.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're prepared and we're doing a great job with it. And it will go away. Just stay calm. Consumers are so powerful in our country with what we've done with tax cuts and regulation cuts and all of those things. The consumer has never been in a better position than they are right now. So a lot of good things are going to happen.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: The Coronavirus outbreak continues to spread throughout the United States. There are now more than 730 confirmed cases. The number of deaths now at 27. And officials in New York State announcing they're setting up a containment zone in a community outside of New York. All schools and here I'm quoting, ""major gathering places"" within a one-mile radius will be shut down for two weeks.  So I guess the question begins with you know, do you agree with containment zones, Jesse?  WATTERS: Well, if the officials believe that a containment zone is effective, I support that. I think we're still learning a lot about the virus. For instance, Matt Gaetz, congressman, was at CPAC the other day, shook hands and took a selfie with a guy who was infected with Coronavirus. He just got tested, and he tested negative. That's a pretty good indication about how contagious it is and who's at risk. It doesn't mean, you know, we know everything, but we're learning a lot more.  In terms of what Congress can do, they can only do so much. Because if the consumer doesn't go to dinner, and the consumer stays inside the house, and the worker doesn't have to go to work, they're told to work from home, the Congress can't make people go outside and spend money. So they're limited in what they can do.  They could do the payroll tax, they could do the loans, they can waive the co-pays if you get tested, but that's not the silver bullet. But looking back at what the left has been saying about what we really need to fear. What have they been saying? What is the existential threat? Global warming, how does that look right now? Global warming is the number one threat to human civilization. It just seems silly at a moment like this when you have a pandemic, you have terrorism, and you have the over-reliance on the Chinese that are really threatening this country.  WILLIAMS: All right, so Dana, the President was up on Capitol Hill today talking with the Republican conference at lunch. They're trying to come up with some kind of economic plan, thinking about a stimulus are going to be a lot of industries that need help in the aftermath of this. But he doesn't have any specific plan yet, except for what Jesse was talking about that payroll tax.  PERINO: The payroll tax.  WILLIAMS: But it's a payroll tax cut, by the way, that would only go to November when he's up for reelection.  PERINO: Well, we don't know all the details, but I do think -- here's the thing, though. So they're trying to figure out a way how do you get ahead of it because you know that this is going to have an economic impact. So there are a few things you could do.  The payroll tax cut, at least, allows you to have more of a broad base support for people rather than picking winners and losers. But if they get into this thing of we're going to help the oil industry but we're not going to help the cruise ship industry. And maybe hotels but not -- but however it all works out, I think they're showing that that there's willing.  But look, in Washington D.C., it's not hard to pass a stimulus bill. Everyone is always open for business if you want to spend more money. But in this case, they might really need to in order to do that. But the other thing is, if you look at like -- forget China for a second, but South Korea.  People are traveling from China to South Korea. Their numbers went up, up, up, up up. What did South Korea do? They had all of these things like canceling big events, social distancing, closing schools, all of that has led to them, if you look at the charts now, their numbers have gone way down. So there's some things that we can do. Early and aggressive action is really important.  WILLIAMS: So Greg, when I was just listening to the president there, I thought, there he goes again. I mean, this is a president who at a time of crisis should project calm and trust.  Fox News alert. Vice President Pence and the Coronavirus Task Force now holding a briefing at the White House. Let's listen in.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES: Good afternoon we just completed today's meeting of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. And I couldn't be more proud of the efforts of the men and women standing behind me or all of those standing behind them.  President Trump said from early on that this would be a whole of government approach. And today gives evidence of the fact that it is also a whole of America's approach. We're bringing the full resources of the federal government and the full resources of this great economy and our great business sector to bear in protecting the American people and protecting American families.  A few updates from today. As we continue to expand testing availability across the country, testing is now available at all state labs. By the end of this week, there will be more than four million more tests made available in jurisdictions around the country. One million are already in place, thanks to the good work of our top commercial labs that the President Trump brought together yesterday.  LabCorp and Quest are in the process now of distributing and marketing coronavirus tests all across America. And we're working with state local officials to ensure that that happens as rapidly as possible. But as the testing is expanding, we wanted to make sure the American people knew that testing was available to them and that cost would not be a barrier.  Today, President Trump assembled the top health insurance executives in America and as we announced earlier today, all of our major health insurance companies have now joined with Medicare and Medicaid and agreed to waive all co-pays, cover the cost of all treatment for those who contract the coronavirus. They've committed to no surprise billing and they've committed to encourage telemedicine.  It was a year ago that Medicaid actually expanded to pay for telemedicine. Medicare pays for telemedicine. So now for seniors who may think that they are either at risk or have contracted the disease, they can get medical advice without having to go to the doctor or go to an emergency room.  I know I speak for President Trump when I say how grateful we are to see our health insurance industry step forward to meet this need for that, that no American should be concerned about being able to pay for or for the cost of a coronavirus test if they deem and their doctor deems it to be appropriate and necessary.  The President also went to Capitol Hill today to meet with members of the United States Senate Republican caucus. There he talked about an economic package, including a call -- he's calling for payroll tax relief. And I think most important to the President's heart, we want to make sure that hourly workers, hard-working blue-collar Americans that may not have paid family leave today, that small and medium-sized businesses in America would be afforded the resources to provide paid leave so that no one would feel that they have to go to work if they might be infected or if they might have been exposed to the coronavirus.  We had a good reception on Capitol Hill. Our legislative teams have fanned out. We're going to be working with Republican and Democrat leadership to move an economic package. Larry Kudlow will be reflecting on that in just a few moments.  We also talked about what are known as N-95 masks and we're working -- Senator Deb Fischer and others have important legislation that would extend temporary liability protections so that masks that are made for industrial use could be sold the hospital to ensure that our healthcare workers are properly protected and outfitted. And we're grateful for growing bipartisan support for that measure, and we're going to be working earnestly with Republicans and Democrats to move a reform that would make more N-95 masks available.  I'm also pleased to report that we did receive this afternoon a comprehensive proposal from the cruise line industry. A proposal that include includes advanced screening, improving medical services on ships, providing for airlift evacuation and land-based care at the expense of the cruise lines for anyone that might be not only infected with the coronavirus, but with any serious illness.  We'll be reviewing that in the next 24 hours. The President's objective is for us to make the cruise lines safer even as we worked with the cruise lines to ensure that no one in our particularly vulnerable population is going out on a cruise in the near future.  I'm going to recognize Dr. Fauci to talk about where we are and Dr. Birx will give us some research that she's done on the scope. We'll have other updates. But let me say once again, this is a whole of government approach. And from early on, President Trump has insisted that our -- that our government at the federal level, all of our partners at the state level work in concert to protect the American people.  And as we stand here today, the risks to the average American of contracting the coronavirus remains low. But we're absolutely determined to give every American the tools and the information that they need to protect themselves, their families, their workplace, their schools, and we're going to work together. We're going to work together to see our way through this and working with leaders in both parties in Congress, working with leaders at the state level all across this nation. I'm confident we will.  With that, Dr. Tony Fauci for an update on the status.  ANTHONY FAUCI, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH: Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President. Just to give you a very brief sketch of what we do every day. The case has continued to increase globally. We're paying particular attention to the cases in Europe, in Italy, and France in which we're starting to see that up at the same time, as the relative number of new cases come down from China. What we're seeing in Europe is that Europe is in that upslope.  So that's something that is expected. That's the way these kinds of outbreaks go. This is not a surprise to anybody. If you look at the history of infectious diseases outbreaks. In the United States, we continue to have new cases. As of this morning, there were 712 I believe, with 27 deaths, guaranteed by the time of this evening that's going to be up and there'll be several more, and tomorrow there'll be several more.  So we realize that this is something obviously, that we've been saying all along, that we're taking very seriously. Now the question is, what are we going to do about that. And there are a number of things that one can do in order to blunt it. If you look at the curves of outbreaks, you know, they go big peaks and they come down, what we need to do is flatten that down. That would have less people infected. That would ultimately have less deaths.  You do that by trying to interfere with the natural flow of the outbreak. So what we're saying today, is that although we keep coming in and saying appropriately, that as a nation, the risk is relatively low, there are parts of the country right now that are having community spread in which the risk there is clearly a bit more than that.  And you know, the places. You know, Washington State, California, New York, and Florida. But what I want to talk to you about today, just for a moment or two is that we would like the country to realize that as a nation, we can't be doing the kinds of things we were doing a few months ago. That it doesn't matter if you're in a state that has no cases or one case, you have to start taking seriously what you can do now, that if and when the infections will come, and they will come, sorry to say, sad to say they will.  But when you're dealing with an infectious disease, you know, we always have that metaphor that people talk about that Wayne Gretzky, you know, he doesn't go where the puck is, he's going where the puck is going to be. Well, we want to be where the infection is going to be as well as where it is.  So what we have here, if you can see that here -- it's here -- is that if you go to coronavirus.gov, remember when Dr. Birx yesterday mentioned some of the things that we put together, these are really simple, keeping the workplace safe, keeping the home safe, keeping the school safe, and keeping commercial establishment safe. This should be universal for the country. Everyone should be doing that. Whether you live in a zone that has community spread or not.  When you have community spread, you are obviously going to ratchet up the kinds of mitigations that you have. But at a minimum, this is the minimum that we should be doing. So everybody should say, all hands on deck. This is what we need to do. So I'll stop there and later, I'll be happy to answer questions.  PENCE: Thank you, Dr. Fauci.  DEBORAH BIRX, CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE COORDINATOR, WHITE HOUSE: Thank you, Mr. Vice President, and thank you, Dr. Fauci, for that clarity. We continue to monitor the situation across the country and across the globe. And we are very fortunate between Dr. Fauci and I, we have long-term contracts out there in many of these countries that are experiencing current outbreaks.  We continue to review all the scientific literature to look for insights and to really determine who's at the greatest risk. And that's why we've talked to you about people with immunodeficiencies at any age, people with medical conditions and the elderly and how important it is for all of us to take these precautions in the household to protect others.  Because we have circulating flu and other respiratory diseases at this time. We all have to act like all of those diseases, any respiratory disease can be transmitted to others. And as we said yesterday, we're hoping that decreases all the respiratory disease we're experiencing.  Finally, we got new reports out of China who had nine pregnant women during an acute COVID infection, and all nine were infected. Both -- and they delivered while they were infected, and all nine babies were healthy and the mothers are healthy. So we continue to look for data like that to be reassuring to the American public, at the same time ensuring that every single person is participating in this response to this virus and taking those precautions that we should be taking every day.  If we start doing this today, we will be ready next year for any of our respiratory diseases because I think we'll be able to show that these simple household, simple work, simple schools, simple business, approaches across the country can change all of our respiratory diseases. So we thank you for getting the message out. We thank you for the participating and ensuring in your households and on households around America, that we're protecting all of those who need our support right now.  PENCE: Excellent. Thank you Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci. And this information is available at coronavirus.gov. And, as we said, we can't say often enough, the risks of contracting the coronavirus to the average American remains low. But for senior citizens with serious underlying chronic health conditions, the potential for serious consequences is very real.  And make no mistake about it, by practicing these habits in your home, in your school, and your business, you're not only protecting your health, but you're also protecting those that are most vulnerable. With that, for an update on our -- the progress that President Trump made today with our health insurance companies, I'd like to recognize Seema Verma.  SEEMA VERMA, ADMINISTRATOR, CMS: As the Vice President said, we had a terrific meeting with the insurance companies, a real example of a public- private partnership where they agreed to waive co-pays for testing, not do any surprise billing, and also cover the costs of the COVID virus- associated costs.  The other things that they did is they asked the president for more flexibility in Medicare Advantage plans. And the President agreed to do that. And so today, we issued guidance to our Medicare Advantage plans that not only can they waive the costs for the test, but they can also go further to removing prior authorization requirements, they can waive prescription refill limits, they can allow for mail delivery of prescription drugs, and expand more access to telehealth services if they weren't offering that in their plan.  Also at CMS, we continue to work with healthcare providers around infection control practices. We met with home health agencies, and also hospitals. And today we issued guidance to dialysis facilities as well as home health agencies around infection control.  PENCE: There's been a great deal of attention about the Grand Princess and HHS working with the Coast Guard with the Department of Defense is currently working through disembarking American passengers returning foreign nationals to their country. And I wanted to ask the secretaries to speak and update us on the progress.  ALEX AZAR, SECRETARY, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES: So with regard to the Grand Princess, I wanted to first express our appreciation to Governor Newsome, to the mayor of Oakland, the people of Oakland, the longshoremen, the stevedores who have helped with bringing it in and clearing the clearing the dock area so that we can do all of our operations there.  We've got Admiral Abel here with us today who's been leading the Coast Guard effort, and then Deputy Secretary Biegun from State has done incredible work with our foreign partners to help with the repatriation of their nationals who are on board the ship. As of our data that I've got is as of noon Pacific time today, so this will have increased quite substantially since my last update.  But as of noon Pacific, we had 548 individuals who have been offloaded from the ship. 228 Canadians are already back in Canada, flown there I believe was overnight. 171 Californians were taken by the government of California and are now at Travis Air Base. 26 individuals were sick and they're being -- they're being treated for various -- it could be from the novel coronavirus, it could also just be -- we had some frail individuals who are sick that needed treatment.  Our goal is to get all of the citizens of California off today to be in the care of the -- of the California State government as well as to get the U.K. citizens off today so that they could be repatriated to the United Kingdom. We continue to work with other countries on all of those maneuvers. We will have non-California residents who will be in transport to the bases at Dobbins and at Lackland today, we hope or tonight.  So everything is progressing. It seems to be progressing well. We're using the highest isolation quarantine procedures, medical screenings possible to ensure the safety of not just the passengers but also of the local communities and all of the healthcare workers and others, emergency responders are helping. So thanks to all of our partners for this -- their help with this very complex operation.  PENCE: Good report. And let me echo the Secretary's appreciation to Governor Gavin Newsom state of California, city of Oakland. It has literally been a seamless partnership. Everyone on that ship will be tested, isolated, and quarantined as appropriate and provided with treatment.  The crew on the ship other than those who were ill will be quarantined on the ship offshore. But it really represented the kind of partnership and cooperation from every level of government that every American I know is grateful to see. With that, on the economic front, Larry Kudlow.  LARRY KUDLOW, DIRECTOR, UNITED STATES NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: Thank you, sir. Yesterday, in a meeting in the Oval, the President acknowledging there going to be challenges on the health and economic side. He mentioned that he intended to bring the full power of the federal government to deal with these challenges.  And accordingly, as Vice President said, up at the Republican Senate luncheon today, and he mentioned it. In this room yesterday, President Trump has unveiled his proposals, strong proposals for a temporary payroll tax cut holiday, which I think he would prefer to last through the end of the year.

54,FOX,"If the media and Democrats hate the current president, then crisis is their tool. Never let a crisis go to waste. For Democrats, every time a crisis appears, that sentiment follows. Take Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif, who chided President Trump for not canceling rallies over the coronavirus. JUDGE JEANINE SLAMS MEDIA'S CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE: IT'S 'DOOMSDAY REPORTING' ""The fact that he is not willing to cancel his various rallies suggests that he is willing to place even his most ardent supporters at risk,"" Speier said. ""I think that he is showing, unfortunately, why he is so ill-prepared to guide our country during this time of crisis."" Like she cares about his supporters. Why demand that just of Trump, and not Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., or former Vice President Joe Biden? Is it just a coincidence that such an order coincides with a political agenda? What's Jackie's next demand? That Republicans shouldn't vote in November, just to be safe from those toxic, contagious voting booths? Yep. Never let a crisis go to waste. That's what the Russians were thinking when they tanked the oil market and put yet another nail in the ""collusion"" coffin. Then there's MSNBC host Chuck Todd's wishful thinking that this virus could be Trump's Iran hostage crisis. ""What the Iran hostage crisis was to the final year of Carter's presidency, not his fault, but it’s a test in real-time,"" Todd said. ""This is what it seems to be for the president."" Journalist Matt Bai responded, ""This does hold the potential, if it goes badly, to become a kind of Jimmy Carter-like scenario where the public just says, 'Can't wake up with this anxiety every day. We’ve got to have some kind of leadership."" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER ""This is what it seems to be for Trump,"" they say. Does that sound like a fact to you? You could blame this idiocy on polarization. The swine flu killed thousands under Obama, but I don't recall the media attacking him, because he was their guy. Then there was Hurricane Katrina, a natural disaster made worse by a corrupt local government. But the media blamed President George W. Bush because he was a Republican, not their guy. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE So that's the pattern. If the media and Democrats hate the president, a crisis is their tool. It isn't new. What is new? A president who responds in kind. That's Trump. His feistiness will not slow our country's great ability to handle this threat. It's what got him to close the borders, which was panned as ""racist"" in the media.

55,FOX,"President Trump visits the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta having signed an $8.3 billion measure to help tackle the coronavirus outbreak. This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" March 6, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: That was President Trump speaking at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia. And we're still awaiting a news conference from Vice President Pence and the Coronavirus Task Force on the outbreak. Let's bring it around the table. Dana, I was struck by the president. He had some harsh things to say about some of the governors. DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Well, I think -- right, OK, so that's -- you cannot say that the White House and the administration hasn't been trying to communicate very effectively, and transparently, and regularly, frequently. That was a very long press conference that the President just held with people from his senior team within the task force. These are the experts in our country. And we should feel pretty good about what's going on. And I can understand the frustration from the president when you have governors who are pointing their fingers back at D.C. especially if they're coming from Washington State. Because Washington State is the one where you have the biggest problem, especially at that one facility. When you have people that are dying, they have a public health emergency, pointing fingers at each other does not help anybody in this situation. And Governor Inslee immediately wanted to be political. When Vice President Pence called him the day after he was appointed to the head of the task force, just to call to say, I want to make sure we're coordinated everything. Inslee, the first thing he did was put out a tweet, like I got a call from the Vice President, and I gave him the what for, and I told him, good if there were scientists involved. And here's the president surrounded every single day by Dr. Anthony Fauci, by Ambassador Birx, by all the people that you would want in a crisis, and you have governors that are pointing the finger back. Meantime, the President was able to sign a bill of $8.3 billion today that is going to -- which he didn't even say they needed. He wanted $2.5 billion. Now the governors and the legislators in Washington gets all that extra money. And where do you think that's going to go? Right straight to the states. And I don't think that the administration will at all hold back any of that money for politics, because they realize that they have a problem. Now the President's always going to get the blame for anything. Every president always does. But I think that nobody can fault them for doing what they've done so far. They're trying, they're trying to be on top of it. And there's a lot of things that we have to do ourselves to take care of ourselves. You cannot expect the government to do everything for you. They can give you a lot of tips. You can avoid misinformation. You can do all the washing of the hands, stay away from people, don't shake hands, all of those things. You have to take care of yourself. There's a lot of things that are happening outside of this country that we can't control that are having the economic impact and the consequences of that. So I think that the governor's if they point their fingers back at the president, they should just be very careful because if you're not managing your state and your cities appropriately, that finger will come back at you and it will be much worse for you. WILLIAMS: So I always think that what we want here is transparency, as you were saying, and we want to know that we can trust the government at any level. But what you hear is people saying oh, but the president, not so much Fauci or Dr. Birx, but they say oh, the President said people can go to work or they'll get better. That the mortality rate -- PERINO: Well, we're at work. We have not been told not to go to work. WILLIAMS: Not -- no, no, no, but I'm saying if you're infected, and we're - - none of us is infected, thank goodness. PERINO: I didn't -- when I heard him say that, I didn't hear him say you should go to work if you have symptoms. He said that everybody should feel like they should -- can go to work unless you're otherwise notified. GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Can I say something? WILLIAMS: Yes, yes, I was going to come to you. GUTFELD: We're pretty sure this show is going to be over anyway. There's something really optimistic going on that people are overlooking. The job numbers were amazing. Granted, it's from last month, but it was 100,000 over the expectations, which offers you a lesson about America itself. One way that you fight a threat, something like a virus, or a battle, or a natural disaster, is that you have to be in your strongest state, right? You have to be at your most powerful, healthy body. You know, you want to make sure you're eating the right stuff. You want to go to the gym. Right now, you have never seen an economy this strong. And because in the last, let's say three to four years, this economy has been become stronger. So if you imagine America as a person, our immune system has never been stronger, which is why this economy and this is the positive part, is able to withstand the stock slides, the up and down of the stocks. We are not freaking out about this. And we know a year from now it'll be fine, right? So the American economy is in its -- is in its strongest. It's in its best state for fighting a war like this one, even a war against something as microscopic as a virus. WILLIAMS: So Jesse -- DAGEN MCDOWELL, GUEST CO-HOST: Can I add to that, because I love it when you talk numbers? The stock market actually despite all the swings was up for the week, number one. Number two, the most important thing is you have a U.S. consumer, because you have a 50-year low and the unemployment rate. GUTFELD: Right. MCDOWELL: Jobs are so plentiful. You have a U.S. consumer that is the best shape in terms of their cash flow, like after they pay all their bills and energy prices, they have the best cash flow on record. And what's happening, because investors, these pros are freaking out, longer-term interest rates are plunging, people are refinancing their mortgages. You have record low mortgage rates on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. And businesses are being calm and they're not laying people off. The airlines after 9/11 laid off 100,000 workers in 10 days. GUTFELD: Wow. MCDOWELL: And you have not seen that happen. Watch the weekly jobless claims. They actually fell in the most recent week. There is no freakout happening. The markets are freaking out, but that's what they do. The American people steady as she goes. GUTFELD: Yes, it's like dating Lindsay Lohan. It goes up, it goes down. And goes up and goes down. JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST: Did you guys have a thing? GUTFELD: Well, it's a long time ago. WILLIAMS: Well, at this point -- at this point, you'd have to get -- WATTERS: I thought I knew everything about you, Greg. WILLIAMS: You'd have to just do a fist bump with Lindsay at this point. So what we heard today was that the President's economic advisors are talking about potential subsidies for the airline industry, the cruise ship industry, even the convention industry because people are more and more canceling. WATTERS: Well, it's going to be a tough quarter. And you know, the quarter after that is going to be even worse. So if they can give some sort of tax relief, if they can inject some sort of liquidity into these industries into the market somehow, maybe that's what they can do to survive the next month or two. Because every time I wake up in the morning, I look at the Dow futures. GUTFELD: No, the mirror. WATTERS: Yes, I look at the mirror. And then I look at the futures, and then I look at the mirror and my face goes like this, because it's not a good look. I don't know how people can handle being in that business, because I'm not in that business, and I'm not scared of anything except when I look at the Dow futures. Once the Dow starts to stop with the volatility, then people will start calming down. GUTFELD: Here's how you know. WATTERS: Yes. GUTFELD: You look at it like an organism. All the stock market is you thinking one way and then -- WATTERS: It's not me, Greg. It's the rest of the country. Or it's the rest of the country that has any skin in the game. Because when I see people out on the streets, they're cautiously optimistic. They're not terrified. Most people that are terrified look like they're on Wall Street. Because the people that see walking around Manhattan -- what do we have eight million people, nine million people in this city, they're riding the subway. I don't see a lot of masks. We're not looking at a lot of stockpiling. This country is recently -- the city at least seems to be weathering the storm. I wish the rest of the investors could weather the storm with a little bit more optimism and sensibility. PERINO: I think -- but isn't that, Dagen, coming mostly from those supply chain issues rather than -- it's about the fact that for example, the trade war gets finished right. And now you have American products and farmers and ranchers being able to send their goods to China, but there is such a backlog in the traffic, you can't unload the cargo into China because of that problem. So it's like a cascading -- WILLIAMS: And the cargo coming from China. MCDOWELL: The biggest issue to get deep into the wage briefly is that normally with recession do you have a demand shock where people aren't traveling for example, or people are not going out to eat. But this is a supply problem because of all the production, even parts that are made in China that has been shut down. But the fact that the virus is improving in China, these factories should start reopening and there will be a backlog. The best thing the government can do, it's not the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates. It's not stimulus like a temporary payroll tax cut or anything like that. It's just to get your arms around this disease and make sure that people don't freak out. But the people are not freaking out. Like I was on the subway the other day. I saw one mask in the literally hundreds upon hundreds -- PERINO: I had a guy today. I was -- I was wearing a coat, I got on the subway, and instead of holding the pole, I just put my elbow around it with my coat and I was holding it like this. And this gentleman sitting, he taps me. I'm like, yes? And he said, I don't think that's a good idea. Because I don't think you should be hugging the pole. And I'm like, I'm just like -- I'm holding it with my elbow so that I don't fall. Because I thought that was safe. GUTFELD: So you're so -- you're so not a New Yorker. The moment he said that, you had about three F-bombs right in his face. Get the F away from me. Don't talk to me. And then he will never do it again. PERINO: But he was so nice. WATTERS: I can't believe that it takes the subway. I didn't think that was her thing. PERINO: I always take the subway or I walk. WILLIAMS: All right, wait a minute. Hold on, hold on -- MCDOWELL: Always need to be -- always need to be ready with a hug in the pole joke. GUTFELD: Yes. WILLIAMS: We should. We could have been. That would be offensive. That would be offensive. WATTERS: Dana? WILLIAMS: Wait a second. That's why I told you not to go down that road. But the investor class clearly, you know, they're well informed. They're got money on the line, skin in the game, as you said. WATTERS: I know. WILLIAMS: And there doesn't seem to be the confidence. WATTERS: Right. There's no confidence now, and I agree. It is about the numbers to a certain extent, and they do trade off the numbers. I think the supply chain deal that's pricing at this point. The numbers the President was talking about when he's saying that there's this cruise ship or you know, there's this ship that's been infected, he doesn't want to bring it back onshore, because what's that going to do? It puts 1,000 people possibly infected back into the number of Americans infected. And that's going to make the mortality rate pop. And he doesn't want that shock to the country because the country looks at a newspaper and sees this big number and freaks out. The investors see this big number and they freak out. If they understand that they just grounded a cruise ship and that -- this is the reason the numbers are going up, people don't look at that. And that's why he wanted to keep it offshore. But I think he gave this task force the authority to do what was ever best for the health and wellbeing of the people on the ship. WILLIAMS: But you saw the Fed earlier this week try to help a little bit. And you saw the market respond also apparently to former Vice President Biden's success on Tuesday. Now it goes back in the other direction. MCDOWELL: It's up for the week. It's up for the week. GUTFELD: Off of the percentage -- off of the percentages, we keep forgetting how large the stock market has become that we were talking about two percent, and then goes up three percent, then it comes down to two percent. It's going to be like this for -- it might look like this for months. WILLIAMS: Well, I agree. GUTFELD: You just have to take the long view. WILLIAMS: Yes, I agree. I said to Jesse, don't look in the morning, just forget about it. WATTERS: The mirror or the market. WILLIAMS: You can look at the mirror. GUTFELD: But wait, can I point out that we did -- we did a spot today on the -- on Fox about Spring Break. Why would you cancel Spring Break if you're in the sun It's warmer and more humid where you're seeing much, much smaller rates of infected. WILLIAMS: No, because they have a large gathering of people. Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

56,FOX,"It's understandable that a weak and anxious man like Chuck Schumer would find himself swept up in the hawkish fever for casual termination of the small and inconvenient. At an abortion rally Wednesday outside the Supreme Court, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., the master of heartfelt hypocrisy, said in reference to Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh: ""You have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price. You won’t know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions."" It’s outrageous stuff. Even Chief Justice John Roberts called Chuck’s comments dangerous. Sensing trouble, Schumer's office offered a coward's lie, claiming Chuck really meant Republicans would pay, not the judges, by birthing a major reproductive rights movement. GOP SENATORS CALL FOR CENSURING SCHUMER OVER SUPREME COURT COMMENTS Which we know is false, because that movement already exists. I want to tell you, Senator Gasbag, never before in history have the unborn faced such hate. Because, you know, they're just a bag of cells unlucky enough to be conceived.

57,FOX,"Billionaire Mike Bloomberg's presidential campaign falls flat on Super Tuesday. What will nearly a billion dollars get you? If former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is any indication, it will get you one victory on an island in the Democratic primary. Congratulations, Bloomer! You earned it, but what a price tag. His campaign is the political version of movie popcorn. Bloomer spent enough to feed nearly everyone in the city of South Bend, Indiana, former Mayor Pete Buttigieg's hometown, for two years. He spent millions per delegate, all to convince people he was better than Trump. If you see some portly dude with a toupee buying everyone at the bar drinks, you can bet he's a campaign consultant. Bloomberg's loss is his new Porsche. MIKE BLOOMBERG WINS AMERICAN SAMOA — AFTER SPENDING $500 MILLION ON ADS But lessons abound. Bloomie proved money talks. Considering his drab persona, his cash still got him nearly to the front of the line. Who knows what would have happened if he had skipped that debate? That’s the other lesson. Money can buy you votes, but not a personality. Ultimately, you're still stuck with it. ""I really am surprised that all of these, my fellow, uh, contestants up here, I guess, would be the right word for it, given nobody pays attention to the clock, I’m surprised they show up, because I would’ve thought after I did such a good job in beating him last week that they’d be a little afraid to do that,"" Bloomberg said at the Democratic debate on Feb. 25. ""They talk about 40 Democrats, 21 of those were people that I spent $100 million to help elect. ... I bought — I got them."" Then there was his exchange with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. ""We have very few nondisclosure agreements,"" he said. ""How many is that?"" Warren replied. ""Let me finish. None of them accuse me of doing anything other than maybe they didn’t like a joke I told,"" Bloomberg said. And let’s not forget his unique way of eating pizza, which includes licking each finger. Then there’s Warren, who couldn't even win her own state. That's like your family going on vacation without you.

58,FOX,"Billionaire Mike Bloomberg's presidential campaign falls flat on Super Tuesday. This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" March 4, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Even though with all of these concerns, at least the fear that it's not going to get much worse or they hope had the DOW about 1173 points. Now, back over 27,000. Here comes ""THE FIVE.""  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Hello, everybody. I'm Jesse Watters, along with Katie Pavlich, Juan Williams, Kennedy, and Greg Gutfeld. It is 5:00 in New York City, and this is THE FIVE. Sleepy Joe finally waking up and bringing his campaign back from the dead, Biden staging a big Super Tuesday comeback, racking up wins in Texas and nine other states.  He was able to stop Bernie Sanders' momentum, but the race is far from over. The socialist nabbing the biggest prize in California, and Bernie is closing the delegate gap with results still coming in. Biden also getting a big boost with mini-Mike Bloomberg dropping out of the race and endorsing him, so Joe is riding high, but he is as flawed as ever.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Just a few days ago, the press and the pundits have declared the campaign dead. Now we are told when we got to Super Tuesday it would be over. Well, it may be over for the other guy. By the way, this is my little sister Valerie and that is her husband. They switched on me. This is my wife. This is my sister. They switched on me.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders is not going down without a fight. Here he is today going after the establishment.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  BERNIE SANDERS (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: What this campaign, I think, is increasingly about is which side are you on. There has been never a campaign in recent history which has taken on the entire political establishment. And that is an establishment which is working frantically to try to defeat us.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: And President Trump adding to the Democrats' division by saying the party is out to crush Bernie. Gutfeld, are you surprised that happened last night?  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: No, I am not, Jesse, because I have been following the transfer 50 years. Once again, the youth vote is a myth that gets hammered, you know, it makes the loudest noise, but it has the smallest effect. It's like one of those tiny little dogs that yaps at you when you go by and when you walk over to it. It runs away and then peas on your shoes, yes, like me.  I think the Dems were like a car careening down a narrow path on a cliff, and do they go off the cliff with Bernie or do they stay on the road? So they chose of two -- they chose from two different risks, right? There is risk of absorbing a socialist, or dealing with somebody who's got mental acuity issues. And they felt that -- I mean, it's kind of smart that they chose the mental acuity issues over socialism.  But I think it is amazing that you can place confidence in a candidate that does not inspire confidence. And that tells you how really scary the field is when you say I'm going to go with that. You know a guy that forgets what -- whose wife and sister is, I mean -- you have the Ilhan Omar vote.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: It is a weak field. I think everybody agrees. It's weak. Juan, I I was watching MSNBC last night.  (CROSSTALK)  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Poor Dana. She -- when he told her that, she said I'm gone.  WATTERS: So I see everybody on MSNBC not giving Joe Biden any credit. You know who they are giving credit? To James Clyburn for the endorsement in South Carolina that has catapulted Joe throughout the rest of the country and triggered the blacks to come out and say he is our guy. Do you think that kind of takes away from Joe's big win?  WILLIAMS: I think Joe had a big win Saturday night in South Carolina, and I think a lot of it came from Clyburn really standing up and saying very clearly that Joe Biden was his candidate. And he thought the best candidate for black voters. Last night, across the south, I mean, we saw several races there. It was something like plus 41 in terms of black votes for Joe Biden over Bernie Sanders.  That is a big different -- big differential, and by the way, to Greg's point about age, it was -- this is amazing to me. People 45 to 64 plus 24 for Biden, and for people who were 65 and over, plus 32, so the young people skew exactly for Bernie as Greg was saying, but the older voters, they really come out and vote. They really participate and they give money. That's the kind of --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: -- because you don't know --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: You don't know. But I will say this. It is now a two man race, wouldn't you say? I was saying it is Biden-Sanders. And I think the second thing to say is that it's Biden's nomination to lose at this juncture, right? So we will see how things go. Jeff Weaver, who is his campaign manager telling the people, you know, just wait.  You know, we're going to do better. We're going to highlight the fact that trade deals were backed by Biden in the Midwest. We will see how some of the people in the manufacturing sector feel. One other thing I want to say, look at these other networks here talking about right here on THE FIVE. You know, I even wrote in my column in The Hill. I said three weeks ago don't buy the conventional wisdom. Joe Biden's coming back and I think he did it.  WATTERS: Yeah. I think maybe we buried him too early. Katie, to Juan's point, it's a two man race. This is Biden's to lose. Is there anything that Bernie Sanders can do to regain the momentum?  KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Well, it depends on who you talk to. So if you look at the primary schedule, you have Michigan coming up. You have Illinois, Pennsylvania. I think he can regain his momentum if Joe Biden starts stumbling again on the campaign trail and doesn't give the confidence that he is electable.  So the electability argument has been dead for a couple of weeks. I would say about two months with Joe Biden. That was what got him into the race. It's what carried him. He started losing to Bernie Sanders, and then after South Carolina, he's able to say I'm the electable guy especially after Bernie Sanders talks about Fidel Castro in a place like Florida, no longer electable on a national stage.  However, Joe Biden keeps arguing that now Bernie Sanders is a socialist. I'm the real Democrat. But if you actually compare the policies of what they are going for and what the voters in all of our analysis are saying. Joe Biden is going to get completely rolled by the left if he gets the nomination. Nancy Pelosi couldn't handle the AOCs and the Ilhan Omar's.  Joe Biden's not going to be able to handle it either. If you look at what they want with single payer, Joe Biden has said that he will raise taxes. He's not -- he's going to run as a moderate. But when it comes to an actual debate about what the policies are going to be, he's going to get pushed further to the left.  WATTERS: Well, he got pushed around on stage a little bit last night. There are some crazy activists that rushed him. Let's watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  BIDEN: Wake up --  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: OK. So Kennedy, I think it is safe to say it's just going to get crazier from here on out.  LISA KENNEDY MONTGOMERY, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Well, you know, as the quick aside, really do us a lot of favors.  GUTFELD: Amen to that, sister. We are the anti-dairy --  (CROSSTALK)  KENNEDY: I don't normally disagree -- a little shocked that Joe Biden, the former Vice President, doesn't have more security detail. His wife and his sister, they are the ones who had to act like his offensive line --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Wait a second. You know, he doesn't have Secret Service protection.  WATTERS: I think he will now.  WILLIAMS: He should. No, no, I'm just saying yesterday --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Like you were saying, hey, why aren't his guys doing -- he doesn't have any Secret Service.  (CROSSTALK)  KENNEDY: I would like to say something about Bernie Sanders. I watched that speech, and you know as a government person, he's making a great case for why big government is running politics. And any time you have too much government in any one thing, they really ruin it. And I wish Bernie Sanders were my guy. I wish I had someone with that much passion who was taking aim at both parties at the same time.  That is why he inspires the kind of loyalty that he does with his supporters. The problem is he lands on the absolute worst conclusion that government is so bad, therefore, we need more of it. But that message is resonating. And it wasn't young people who pushed him over the top in California, it was Latinos. And they look to Bernie Sanders if you're blobbing people in groups, and --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: Kennedy's looking for a guy with passion.  GUTFELD: I know. And I'm right here, baby.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Here is the issue with young voters, though. They are enamored by lofty goals. But they're not so much interested in ways to achieve them. And it's kind of reflected how they voted. They like Sanders, but I'm not so sure I'm going to get up this morning and go vote, because the ways are more difficult than the actual dreaming of the goals. And that is when you become an adult, you think about the ways and not just the goals.  WILLIAMS: You know that people had to wait in line in Texas for hours -- in California for hours. I mean, he did have to make an effort. But one final point, guess what, Donald Trump, the guy that he still fears the most on the Democratic side is now in the lead.  WATTERS: Well, you always say Trump fears whoever.  WILLIAMS: I don't have to say it.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: No one is carried of anybody on the left, Juan. Up next, it's happy trails for mini-Mike. Greg Gutfeld breaks down just how embarrassing Bloomberg's half a billion-dollar face plant really is.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: So what will $1 billion get you? An island.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- caucuses in American Samoa. They have 100 percent reported. And Mike Bloomberg gets five delegates from American Samoa.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Yes, congratulations, Bloomer. You earned it, but what a price tag. His campaign is the political version of movie popcorn. Bloomer spent enough to feed nearly everyone in the city of South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete's home town for two years. Millions per delegate all to convince people he was better than Trump. If you see some portly dude with a toupee buying everyone at the bar drinks, you can bet he is a campaign consultant.  Bloomberg's loss is his new Porsche. But lessons abound, Bloomey proved money talks. Considering his drab persona, his cash still got him nearly to the front of the line. Who knows if he had skipped that debate? That is the other lesson. Money can buy you votes, but not a personality. Ultimately, you are still stuck with this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  MIKE BLOOMBERG (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I really am surprised that all of these, my fellow contestants up here, I guess, would be the right word for it, even nobody pays attention to the clock. I'm surprised they show up, because I would have thought after I did such a good job in beating them last week that they would be a little bit afraid to do that.  They talked about 40 Democrats, 21 of those were people that I spent $100 million to help elect. I bought -- I got them. We have a very few, nondisclosure agreements. Let me finish.  ELIZABETH WARREN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: How many is that?  BLOOMBERG: None of them accused me of doing anything other than -- maybe they didn't like the joke I told.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: All right. And let's not forget --  (CROSSTALK)  KENNEDY: Can I have money?  GUTFELD: Let's not forget his unique way of eating pizza, licking each finger. I haven't been this grossed out since I walked in on grandparents. Then there is Liz who couldn't even win her own state. That's like your family going on vacation without you. She's Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone. The entire state ditched her, leaving her with one powwow cookbook and 365 identical black shirts.  The lesson here, America's pretty good with discerning fakes. Liz couldn't shake the authentic truth that her ambition created new deceptions and each lie a new twist on victim hood. No wonder her constituents have reservations for a woman who falsely claimed her ancestors lived on one. So last night, the Dems chose a comfy sweater over identity politics, money, and a socialist.  Could the party finally have grown up? No, all they did was reach old age. Nope, Juan, what sucks about him dropping out is we're not going to see the Bloomberg/Trump match-up that we so desperately wanted, because it would be great.  WILLIAMS: It would've been interesting, right? Because we live in a populist age as we often talk about, and we think, you know, maybe Sanders is a mirror of Trump. But actually Bloomberg would have been an interesting mirror to Trump. I don't know if the populist base of the Democratic Party would have taken to him the way the populist base of the GOP took to Trump.  But I will say -- to me, looking back on Bloomberg's campaign, no one can defy the primary process. He's decided to skip those first four contests.  KENNEDY: Like Giuliani?  WILLIAMS: Yeah, like Rudy. That's what occurred to me. Like Rudy, Kennedy. And obviously it didn't work for Rudy. And it didn't work for him. Maybe somebody in the future is able to do it again with a lot of money, but it did not work for this guy.  GUTFELD: You know, Kennedy, I was just thinking when I was doing this that Liz was really the one that took out Bloomberg.  KENNEDY: Yes.  GUTFELD: She -- he pulled a Carrigan, as I like to call it.  KENNEDY: So Liz, in -- I think she's really hurt herself with progressives if she stays in, because she was there for two reasons. And both of those reasons were to protect Joe Biden. So she has promised her allegiance to the Democratic establishment from the beginning of this process, because she has needed their support.  And she stayed in, in order to poke a few more holes in Bloomberg, not that that needed to happen after last night, but also to take some votes away from Bernie. So, you know, how would Bernie have done in Massachusetts if she had dropped out before Super Tuesday? And, you know, it's pretty clear that he would have had a greater delegate hall if she had.  And I'm just wondering, you know, Ilhan Omar sent out a nasty tweet last night, and squarely Elizabeth Warren. And I'm wondering if she shares that vitriol with more progressives who really now want nothing to do with her.  GUTFELD: Oh, brother, as I like to say. Hey, Jessie, I almost forgot your name.  WATTERS: Jesse Watters.  GUTFELD: Yes. I want to know what you are thinking now about Bloomberg or Liz.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: I'll tell you what I'm thinking. You buy an island. You should get to live there.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: -- the biggest con job of all time. The Bloomberg campaign had seven fully paid staffers living in America Samoa for three months.  GUTFELD: Really?  WATTERS: I have to see that expense report. I know junkets. And that has to be the best junket of all time. There are 40,000 voters in American Samoa. They only got 175 of them to vote for Mike Bloomberg. What the hell were they doing in American Samoa for three months?  PAVLICH: Partying.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: It's amazing. And Bloomberg did not even miss that he was missing a half a billion. This has to be a huge con job. You get seven percent of the ad buy. He spent over $500 million. The ad guy -- I'm not going to say his name, hid $40 million this winter. I'm not going to say his name -- you know ex-girlfriends or pretend family members knocking at his door with their hands out, because everybody knew this guy did not have the political talent to pull this off.  He can't read a prompter. He is worse than Al Sharpton. His voice is worse than Liz Warren, and he looks like a sea turtle. He actually said this. I was watching his speech last night.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: He read this. I want to put the united back in the United States of America. Even Beto O'Rourke would have tossed that line out. That is not good material. I can't believe this guy --  GUTFELD: Katie, do you care to add anything oh him?  PAVLICH: We're never going to solve the box controversy.  (CROSSTALK)  PAVLICH: The box whether Michael Bloomberg gets a box if he were to debate President Trump. But everyone's making a pretty big deal out of the fact that Michael Bloomberg is backing Joe Biden. It's, like, congratulations, the guy who won 175 votes in American Samoa is now backing you and endorsing you. Good luck, like, maybe some of the money will be helpful. But in terms of a movement, any kind of grassroots support from Michael Bloomberg.  It does not exist. So I wouldn't be banking on that. The other thing is Michael Bloomberg participating in that debate in the town hall with Fox, he completely exposed himself as an elitist who believes that he knows better than you, and that he's going to tell you how you are supposed to live your life while he gets to do whatever he wants.  He used to be kind of this figure that nobody really had like a moderate appeal to. I think he completely exposed himself as the opposite --  KENNEDY: -- and no self awareness, licking his fingers and putting that half-eaten pizza slice back in the box.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Didn't you vote for him as a Republican?  WATTERS: I wasn't not living in New York City at the time, but nice try, Juan.  WILLIAMS: OK.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: -- a stupid question. You can laugh at me. American Samoa, is there another Samoa?  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: There you go.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: They should call them the mini-Mike's.  GUTFELD: Next up, the media Democratic establishment attacking Bernie Sanders after Super Tuesday.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WILLIAMS: It was a disappointing night for Bernie Sanders, the senator from Vermont banking on a huge Super Tuesday victory. It didn't happen. And while he nabbed the biggest prize, California, Senator Sanders fell far short in other crucial states. Now, the media is lashing out.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We don't have the majority of the Democrats that are in on the revolution.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It is a grievance message. It is an anger message. With regard to an establishment, certainly if there is one, Bernie Sanders is a part of it.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He has been walloped apparently tonight in Virginia and in North Carolina and in Alabama.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I keep saying a lot of the latte liberals are disconnected from the base of the Democratic Party, which is the African- American voters.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: So Jesse, do you think the media is against Bernie. Because it echoed to me when people in the right said the media is against Trump. And now it's the media against Bernie.  WATTERS: Yeah, they are against Bernie. But they are not strong like Trump was. And I don't think Bernie can overcome the avalanche. I think he was looking for a revolution, but he got a rude awakening last night, Juan. His coalition just cannot cut it. He is better as an underdog. He can't take the heat as a frontrunner, and that's why he imploded.  WILLIAMS: All right. Hold on a second.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: I've got to do it, Greg. Fox News alert, Vice President Pence is holding a briefing on the Coronavirus. Let's listen in.  MIKE PENCE, UNITED STATES VICE PRESIDENT: - the White House Coronavirus taskforce. It has been a very busy and productive day here at the White House. President Donald Trump has no higher priority than the safety and health of the American people. And the president has directed our taskforce, employing the full resources of the federal government and full partnership with state and local health authorities to make that priority a reality.  As I stand before you today, we have more than 100 Coronavirus cases in the United States. That is counting domestic cases and cases of Coronavirus of Americans that were returned from China or the Diamond Princess. I'm pleased to report that most of those who contracted Coronavirus within our care are continuing to recover.  But sadly, we received word today that another American has passed away, and their family has our deepest condolences. That being said, thanks to the president's strong leadership and the professionalism of all of our federal agencies, Health and Human Services, CDC, and state and local health officials all across this country, the risk to the American public of contracting the Coronavirus remains low.  To be clear, if you are a healthy American, the risk of contracting the Coronavirus remains low. But it is still a good idea to engage in common sense practices that are always recommended this time of year. So as someone who has a mother who is 87 years of age and who has married kids living around the country, a brief tutorial on prevention for yourself, for your family and your loved ones. It's a good idea to stay home when you're sick. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Cover your cough or sneeze with tissue, throw the tissue in the trash. Clean and disinfect frequently. Wash your hands with either a disinfectant or with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.  And let me say again, as we've said before, there's no need for Americans to buy masks. And the common-sense practices that I just described are all available@cdc.gov. Today we had a series of meetings here at the White House and on Capitol Hill. We met with executives of the airline industry, the executives of commercial labs, executives of nursing homes, and our team also met with the Republican and Democratic caucuses in the House of Representatives.  And we were pleased to learn that just shortly ago, the House of Representatives passed a federal funding bill by virtually unanimous margin and will now move to the Senate. And the legislation implements the President's vision to ensure that not only do our federal agencies have the support and resources that they need, but also that our state and local partners have their support.  And in my conversations with governors all the way through this afternoon, I know they're grateful for the bipartisan spirit that has characterized this funding bill and will continue to work through that process. As President Trump said, we're all in this together. And he deployed a whole of government approach. But thanks for the presence leadership, it has actually developed into a whole of America approach. And the meetings today with industry leaders is a reflection of that.  As Dr. Birx will indicate in just a few moments with some of the data that we're evaluating from around the world, it does appear that the elderly are the most vulnerable, and especially those with serious health issues. At the President's direction, as a result, Seema Verma will describe that the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services has issued new guidelines for nursing homes nationwide.  We have raised the bar regarding infectious disease control at our nursing homes. And in addition, administrator Verma will explain how we are going to focus all of our inspection resources for the foreseeable future on compliance with infection control standards. Generally, we monitor our nursing homes for abuse neglect. But at the President's direction, we're going to focus exclusively on ensuring that those who are in nursing homes people operating the nursing homes, like many of the CEOs that we met with today, are complying with the new standards to keep our elderly safe.  The President also met today with airline executives. And I'll reiterate, as the President said, our profound gratitude to our partners in the airline industry. They have worked with us in as we say, flowing Americans through particular airports, the screening. We're working very closely with airlines on contact information. If a person is tested as positive for the coronavirus, we're working with the airlines to get all the information not just about that person, but about who they sat next to and who else was on the flight. And the president and I are very grateful.  As we announced yesterday, I'm pleased to report that as of yesterday morning, in addition to the travel ban from China, we suspended all travel coming in from China, we've suspended all travel coming in from Iran, and even foreign nationals who visit either one of those countries are barred from coming into this country for 14 days.  We also established a travel advisory for Italy, portions of Italy, and portions of South Korea over the weekend. But even as importantly, as of yesterday morning, we fully implemented a screening process. All direct flights from all airports in South Korea and Italy are now being subject to multiple screens before passengers board to come to the United States of America.  The State Department worked very vigorously to bring that about and we're grateful for the cooperation. The governments of Italy and governments of South Korea as well as our airline partners in making that a reality.  Finally, with regard to testing, we had a meeting today that gave us great hope for great progress in the near future on expanding testing across the country. We have ways to go yet. And I'm pleased to report as we've been able to convey to state governments, governors around the country, is that thanks to the good work of the FDA and Dr. Steve Hahn, who's with me here today. Now, all state laboratories, all University laboratories at the state level, can conduct coronavirus tests without any additional assets or resources from the federal government. They have the FDA approved tests they can conduct the test all across the country and all the states.  Beyond that, as we announced through the efforts of HHS 2,500 kits of tests are going out this week that -- 2,500 kits including test is going out this week. That's roughly 1.5 million. A test that will be available this week will continue to build on that number. But perhaps most significantly, thanks to Dr. Birx's efforts and leadership. We brought together today at the White House the leaders of all of the largest commercial laboratories in this country, companies like Quest that have vast capabilities, logistics and testing capabilities.  And we were pleased to report today that they have created a consortium to share information and to share resources and literally have told us that as they go through what is called the validation process, on testing, that by next week, individual companies will be able to do as they said to meet thousands of tests of coronavirus if they are needed and required and many, many multiples more of that in the not distant future.  Our objective here is Dr. Birx raised with the task force is we've got hospitals in affected areas and those that are requesting that have kits. We've got universities and state labs that now can perform the test on a requested basis. But our objective ultimately, and quickly as possible, is to have tests made through these commercial laboratories and commercial providers, that your local doctor, your CVS, your med check, is able to have a coronavirus test.  And that isn't there yet. We're working to make that a reality. But again, it's one more example. It's not just a whole of government approach, it's a whole of America approach. Whether it be our nursing home industry, whether it be our airline industry, whether it be our commercial laboratories. I can -- I can speak on behalf of President Trump and our entire task force when I say we are profoundly grateful for the spirit is being reflected by companies all across the United States of America, grateful for the leadership at the state level.  And the American people should be confident that that spirit of partnership is going to continue to drive this at every level as we work our way through dealing with the coronavirus in the United States. With that, I'm going to recognize Dr. Deborah Birx for her comments.  DEBORAH BIRX, CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE COORDINATOR, WHITE HOUSE: Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Good evening. Over the -- over the last 12 hours, we've been able to receive information both from South Korea and Italy adding to our China information. And it's as we thought, the elderly and preexisting conditions have a more serious eldest when confronted with the coronavirus.  Reassuringly in South Korea, no one has died under 30. This is reassuring to us. And the median age in Italy was 81 of those who succumbed. Those who became ill, the median age was 60. So we find this data reassuring, but it also has really caused us to focus on the Americans who might be most vulnerable.  So we're focusing resources, attention and all of our capacity to ensure those who have preexisting conditions and those who are elderly have access to the best prevention and treatment options. The prevention options flow right through all of us to ensure that we have good protective hygiene for our elderly clients around the globe. Thank you.  PENCE: Thank you. Seema?  SEEMA VERMA, ADMINISTRATOR, CMS: Thank you. And as you heard, because of the risk for our nation's seniors, we are doubling down on our efforts. Today we put out three memos one was to hospitals about triage and placement for patients with suspected or confirmed coronavirus.  We also put out some information to nursing homes about limiting visitors to nursing homes, monitoring staff. And then finally we put out some information to our state surveyors that are going to be surveying our nation's nursing homes and hospitals around infection control. So all that information went out this morning.  PENCE: Very good. Thank you, Seema. CDC, Bob Redfield.  ROBERT REDFIELD, DIRECTOR, CDC: Thank you, Mr. Vice President. I think what I'd like to highlight today is to first echo with the vice president started with when he was given the American people the advice that he did as he went through that we do have listed out on our CDC web site cdc.gov.  It really is very important. It's very pragmatic about washing your hands 20 seconds with soap and water or using the other disinfectants. Obviously training yourself to cover your sneeze or cough either in your elbow or with a Kleenex that he will dispose of. These are very important things. Working hard not to touch your face.  I think the most important thing for many of those individuals that might be a little Type A, if you get sick, stay home. You're not helping your colleagues by going to work sick. And again, I think these are just very pragmatic. We've listed them. They're absolutely no different than what we ask the American public do for flu.  The second thing I would like to do is continue to get the help from you to get those messages out. The one that's the most important that the vice president also talked about, is the role of mask. We need these N-95 masks for the health care workers that are taking care of these patients. We do not recommend them to be used by the general public.  And again, you all, if you tell the stories are able to be great community of that, so that the American public gets accurate information, and gets good guidance from your experts that you'll reach out to for your story. So that's what I would ask you to do.  And I'll reiterate what the vice president said at the beginning, that although we're continuing to see new community cases in this nation, the overall risk to the American public at this time still remains low. Thank you.  PENCE: Thank you very much. Dr. Fauci?  ANTHONY FAUCI, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH: Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Just to reiterate, what was said by several of our colleagues here, is that we make policy recommendations and analysis of what we're going to recommend based on accumulation of data. Data is very important. What Dr. Birx just told you is data that underscore some of the things that we've been telling you.  You know, when you talk about risk, you know, risk is something that's vague to people. And we've said many times, if you talk about risk of infection throughout the country, it's a low risk. If you talk about someone who is infected, and we do have infected people in this country, you've heard that from Dr. Redfield, you understand the situation that we have in Seattle.  If you do get infected, if you're infected as taking Seattle as the microcosm of that, it is exactly what Dr. Birx said, the risk of getting into difficulties is very heavily weighted towards people with underlying conditions and people with the elderly, where are the young people -- and they will be an exception here the same way we see with influenza. But the risk for a young person who gets infected to getting into trouble is really low based on a lot of data that's coming out of foreign countries, particularly out of China.  PENCE: Great. Thank you, Dr. Fauci. Dr. Carson?  BEN CARSON, SECRETARY, HUD: I want to thank the Vice President and the president for a very aggressive and careful leadership. Now I was involved throughout my neurosurgical career with a lot of very, very complex cases and dealt with a lot of renowned physicians. But I must say that the people on this task force are extremely impressive, have been considering all the various different possibilities outlining scenarios for all the possibilities that can occur.  And it's very comforting -- and recognize that the risk to a healthy adult still remains quite low largely because of the aggressive actions that have been taken and are continuing to be taking every day. And just one last point, and that is the pharmaceuticals who normally are rivals have worked together voluntarily. Wouldn't that be a great lesson for the politicians?  PENCE: Quick informational announcement. I'll be traveling with many members of the task force to Minnesota tomorrow. We'll be visiting 3M which is poised to literally begin manufacturing millions more masks for healthcare workers, and then we'll be traveling on to Washington State. We'll be meeting with Governor Inslee and with his health team to ensure that the full resources of the federal government are being brought to bear in support of their efforts to protect the health of people across the Seattle area. So with that, let me start right here.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you, Vice President Pence. I have two questions. One about Washington and then one about Florida. I'll start with Washington. Can you tell us a little bit more about how that meeting came to be? Will Secretary Azar be with you? Is that a meeting that the governor asked you to come there? Can you explain?  PENCE: The -- I've spoken to Governor Inslee, who I know well from our time in Congress together several times since being tapped to lead the White House effort on the coronavirus a week ago. He's been providing strong leadership for the state of Washington. They have an outstanding health department.  But after meeting with members of the Senate and the House, particularly those from the Washington State delegation, we thought it would be important to bring our team out to meet with their team on the ground, and to make sure that they have the full support. Our hearts go out to those that have been infected with the disease in the Seattle area, but also we understand the anxiety this has created in the full community. And we're going to be going out just to make sure and sitting down with the governor with his team that they have everything they need and all the support they need to see to the health of their people.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you, sir. And on Florida, you will have a meeting on Saturday, is that correct, with the cruise liners? Which companies are coming to that meeting? What's the goal of that meeting? Is there something that you'd like to see them do differently that they are not doing now?  PENCE: Well, we'll talk about just that. Obviously, with the Diamond Princess issue, there are unique challenges that our experts tell us in a closed environment of a cruise liner. We're going to talk about best practices. And I thought it was timely to spend some time with people in that industry as we're meeting with the others in industries around the country. OK, right there, please.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Two quick questions. The first one, I've been looking online at hand sanitizer. And so there's some -- there's some sites like Amazon where these prices have just skyrocketed. What's your advice to Americans who are trying to decide soap and water and the hand sanitizers that you're telling them buy, but can't afford it at this point or can't find it?  PENCE: That's great. I want to ask CDC to respond to that because they've got some very clear guidance.  REDFIELD: Thank you, Mr. Vice President. I want to make it really clear that I don't think soap and water -- vigorously washing your hands for 20 seconds is what the American public needs to do. If they want to use the hand sanitizers, that's another option. But I don't want people to think it's inferior to what we've recommended for decades which is vigorous washing your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds.  PENCE: OK, there's another one. Another one, go ahead.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You're talking about working on getting testing so that the doctors and other places will be able to have it. How far along are you in that goal and what should Americans expect -- how soon should Americans expect to be able to go to their doctor's office to get tested?  PENCE: Well, I'm going to ask Birx to address that, but just so you know, there's three levels here. Number one is that we do have about 1.5 million test kits going out as we speak to hospitals, particularly hospitals in areas that have seen coronavirus cases. In addition to that, thanks to the good work of the FDA and the change that President Trump authorized this weekend, now every state health lab and university lab can conduct a coronavirus test. And that expands the capacity.  But ultimately as Dr. Birx will explain, our objective is in addition to those tests being available, we want to get to a place where any American who has a concern is able to go to their doctor, is able to go to a medical clinic and know that there's a coronavirus available. We think we can get there in a matter of weeks, and in partnership with the commercial labs. We're challenging them to do just that. Dr. Birx.  BIRX: Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Just briefly, because I think you were interested also in cost. And I think what we've heard from CMS and from HHS that this will be an essential lab test so fully reimbursable. What we talked about with the commercial laboratories is exactly your question. And we ask them, and they're in validation this week. Some of them thought they would have tests available on Friday and the rest on Monday.  I've asked them to prioritize the areas where we've had these clusters so that people can be reassured in those areas where there is -- where we've have identified virus has been circulating. In those cases, they will have it available at doctor's office, and all of our pediatric offices that would need it, and they will transport it through a logistics network to make sure that they can be run.  PENCE: With regard to -- with regard to the cost, let me be very clear. HHS has designated the coronavirus test as an essential health benefit. That means by definition, it's covered in the private health insurance of every American as well as covered by Medicare and Medicaid. And so, we're working with members of Congress and we'll be monitoring the cost very carefully. Please.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: With travel restrictions on Italy and South Korea, are you considering more -- imposing more restrictions on traveling?  PENCE: Well, I'm going to ask Dr. Fauci to speak to that. At this time, they're not recommending that the President impose additional travel advisories or restrictions. But as Dr. Fauci can explain, we're going to follow the data on that very closely and follow the cases. You want to speak to that.  FAUCI: So this is something that's really evaluated in real-time. I mean, you can't make a decision now that you're going to project what's going to be. You just base it on the data. And it became very clear that the situation in northern Italy and in Korea was actually unique compared to what we were seeing in several of the other countries. That's why that was done. We reevaluate this literally, every single day.  PENCE: We do. We do. Right there.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  PENCE: No, right here.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you.  PENCE: No, right here.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Me?  PENCE: Please.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you. So I was wondering what sort of progress was making with your meeting with the airline CEOs today about coordinating the collection of passenger data? And then also there's been reports that the CDC is investigating a potential cluster of cases from a cruise ship in California that could be linked to the state's first death. Could you confirm that? And how many people might the CDC be investigating in that case?  PENCE: I'll let CDC respond to your second question. But the first question, I know the President was also very moved by the level of commitment from our airlines for customer's health and safety as well as their crews. Health and Safety there, they described to us their activities, in cleaning the aircraft and sanitizing aircraft.  And we believe as President Trump said today that it's safe to fly. It's safe to fly in America and it's safe to fly internationally apart from the travel advisories that are available to the public. With that being said, we -- it's a work in progress about having contact information. But we were assured today by the airlines that they'll continue to work very closely with us to provide manifests, passengers on an on an individual flight in the event of a coronavirus infection.  And the cooperation has been just what the American people would expect from our airlines. But let me -- let me let CDC speak to the other issue.  REDFIELD: Thank you, Mr. Vice President. So we are working in support of the California Health Department that's in the process of evaluating another cruise ship where they do have confirmed cases. We're at the very beginning of that, looking at the manifest, to make sure we understand who's gotten off the cruise, and where they got off the cruise, and we're really involved in that entire contact follow up as we speak. Thank you.  (CROSSTALK)  PENCE: Right here.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you very much. And possibly a question for Dr. Birx regarding it's being safe to fly. You have Spring Break coming along. A lot of grandparents may be coming to visit family members to help watch over kids, older adults, is it safe? If it's unnecessary travel, should they still hop on a plane and travel?  BIRX: But that's why we're talking about the common sense approach. So if you have preexisting medical conditions, or your of the elderly and frail, that is something that they need to take into context. And that's why we were very clear about providing that information. Because we really want everyone to know what we know. That we received this new data, we've gone through it carefully, it does look like there is significant greater risk of serious illness as you become older and if you have other medical conditions.  Now, what I talked about also was protecting the elderly and protecting those with other medical conditions. And I want to be clear the other medical conditions included people recovering from cancer. So just as you would protect them when they have their chemotherapy and their immune responses are lower, you would do that with careful handwashing again and ensuring if you have children in the household, that they're following those same procedures.  I have a nine-month old and a two-year-old grandchild. And they're -- the two-year-old has learned to wash your hands carefully. And I think these are just things we need to ensure happening every day in households.  (CROSSTALK)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you have -- do you have any hesitations traveling to Washington State tomorrow on your own personal health and are you trying to send a message to all Americans that you believe it is safe to fly?  PENCE: No, I have no hesitation at all. To tell you, the job that Washington State has done in confronting the coronavirus infections in the Seattle area has really been inspiring. They've got an outstanding health facility, outstanding health department, and we're going to be sitting down with all of their health officials.  But I'm a real believer just as the president is. And sitting down, sitting nose to nose as president did today with executives, and asking the questions and making sure that the American people expect nothing less. They expect us to be there for that community. And we'll be bringing our task force out to make sure that Washington State has all the support that they need. And that's the purpose of the trip.  (CROSSTALK)  PENCE: Last one.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you, Mr. Vice President. I appreciate it. In light of what Dr. Redfield said yesterday about how quickly this virus has been spreading, what needs to happen specifically for you to declare this a national emergency? What's the threshold? Will it be the number of deaths, will be the number of cases?  (END VIDEOTAPE)  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: That's a briefing at the White House on the coronavirus. Vice President Pence, Dr. Deborah Birx, all talking and giving the latest information. Katie, clearly, they say it's safe to fly. What do you think?  PAVLICH: I'm going to listen to what the experts have been saying. They've been briefing us every day with lots of new information. And it sounds like the higher risk for people, especially when it comes to fatalities are people who are older, elderly and frail, as the doctor was saying, who have underlying medical conditions.  We should go about our daily lives, continue to wash your hands with soap and water. They stress that you do not need these hand sanitizers to be safe and clean to fight this virus and to avoid it, so soap and hot water will do. So I think just listening to their advice is a good thing and not panicking and moving forward is also a good thing.  WILLIAMS: So Greg, the Vice President's going out to Minnesota to 3M. They manufacture the mask. And then he's going on to Washington state where there's been a center of the outbreak. What do you think?  GUTFELD: Well, I think exactly what Katie said is correct. I think it's important to divert the focus away from like schools and planes and look more at nursing homes and hospitals because that's where the vulnerable are concentrated.  I think we are seeing a lot of optimistic research coming out based on the cruise liner. I would urge everybody to go to Google. Google Jeremy Faust, F-A-U-S-T. He has a piece in Slate, probably the most comprehensive and up debate -- up to date piece on this. I think people going out and trying to buy all the toilet paper at Costco and buying you know water it makes no sense to me. I think that you're going to look back and it's going to be seen as a little overdone.  WATTERS: What your toilet paper safeguard? What's your move, Greg?  GUTFELD: Well, you when you're ordering food from delivery, asked for extra napkins.  WATTERS: Right.  PAVLICH: I say -- I think it's always good to have extra water around just for the record.  KENNEDY: But that's the point.  PAVLICH: It's just good to be always be prepared.  KENNEDY: You should always be prepared for anything.  PAVLICH: Yes.  KENNEDY: Anything could happen. We know that living here in New York City, you know that living near D.C. Anything can happen. So it's good to be prepared. It's always bad to pay panic. And we have -- having more facts come in, and that's what these doctors are saying, we have more data, we have a clear picture of how the virus is doing the most damage. And Greg is absolutely right. That's where they should be committing resources.  WILLIAMS: All right. So what do we see, Jesse, as they say they are only limiting travel from certain areas Italy, the Koreas. But even there, they're saying, it's in the senior citizen centers and of course vulnerable populations, people who were sick diabetes, high blood pressure, and the rest.  WATTERS: It seems like this country's finally starting to get a handle on things and I think people are beginning to be more confident the more they learned. I did a ""WATTERS WORLD"" shoot downtown today and I asked about two things. I asked about Super Tuesday and the coronavirus.  No one had a clue what happened on Super Tuesday and everybody knows about corona and what to do. They know how to wash their hands, sneeze like this, and everything else. So it does seem like that information is breaking through to people that don't know about Super Tuesday.  KENNEDY: And it's OK to publicly sneeze shame people who aren't covering their mouths when they sneeze.  WILLIAMS: Oh no.  GUTFELD: There's nothing worse than this snotty Tuesday.  WILLIAMS: I like -- I like the Wuhan foot shake.  WATTERS: That's right.  WILLIAMS: That's it for us. Set your DVRs. Never miss an episode of THE FIVE.

59,FOX,"Democratic establishment rallies around Joe Biden even as the former vice president's gaffes raise electability concerns. Moments after getting endorsed by Democrats who were fleeing this slow-rolling disaster, former Vice President Joe Biden quickly inspired confidence in their decisions. ""We hold these truths to be self-evident. All men and women are created, by the, go, you know, you know the thing,"" Biden said. ""Look, tomorrow’s Super Thurs… Tuesday. And I want to thank you all. I’ll tell you what, I’m rushing ahead, aren’t I?"" As always, he could blame it on the Russians! I wonder if President Trump noticed? BIDEN ACCIDENTALLY SAYS 'TOMORROW IS SUPER THURSDAY' AT RALLY AHEAD OF CRUCIAL PRIMARIES He did. ""Tomorrow voters in states all across the nation will head to the polls for Super Tuesday. Not Super Thursday. Oh, he said, 'Super Thursday.' You can't do these things,"" Trump said. ""He's constantly naming the wrong state. 'It's great to be in the state of Ohio.' 'No, no, no. I'm sorry. You're in North Carolina.'"" ""I honestly don't think he knows what office he's running for."" Trump added, ""They're going to put him into a home, and other people are going to be running the country, and they're going to be super-left radical crazies."" Now, everyone makes gaffes, but Joe's multiply faster than rabbits. And while sometimes Trump's words are  shocking, they don't hint at an underlying decline. Biden's words remind you that he's not getting any younger, let alone wiser. And it makes you wonder about the endorsements from Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., former Rep. Beto O’Rourke, D-Texas, and former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg really mean. Is Biden really leading a parade of enthusiastic support? Or is this a gurney race to push him across the finish line on a stretcher? CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER He also faces a bigger challenge though. He is moderate by today’s loony-left standards, but his one and only idea is, ""Get rid of that orange meanie."" That’s not a vision. That's a complaint. Meanwhile, Bernie is the outsider whose vision is strong — despite being wrong. It’s why he attracts the youthful, the mad and the crazy. In a world where we idealize the bold, a radical is just sexier than a bumbling moderate. Even a radical with ear hair. It’s not fair. It’s not smart. But it's life. Maybe if Democrats hadn't thrown all their weight behind the fantasy of impeachment, they would have seen this coming. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Instead, Democrats are stuck with three voting choices. Two are cranky old men, and one who is sleeping in. I put my money on the ""snooze"" button.

60,FOX,"Voters in 14 states head to the polls, including folks in delegate-rich California and Texas; reaction on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" March 3, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: We will see you then. ""THE FIVE"" is now.  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino, along with Katie Pavlich, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It is 5:00 in New York City and this is THE FIVE. The future of the Democratic Party could very well be at stake tonight. The first Super Tuesday polls said to close two hours from now, the big story, the major showdown between Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden.  Millions of voters across 14 states are said to choose between Sanders' brand of socialism and Joe Biden's more moderate approach. But as we have seen, we could be in for some surprises, Michael Bloomberg on the ballot for the first time, and Elizabeth Warren still in the race. The fight for more than 1,300 delegates up for grabs taking a dramatic turn with Joe Biden picking up the endorsement of his former 2020 rivals. Will it make a difference?  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If Democrats want a nominee to beat Donald Trump, then join us.  MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG (D-IN): And I am delighted to endorse and support Joe Biden for president.  SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN): So I want all of you to do is vote for Joe.  REP. BETO O'ROURKE (D-IN): I will be casting my ballot for Joe Biden.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: Bernie Sanders not backing away from the fight.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  BERNIE SANDERS (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You all know. You can't miss it if you turn on the TV, the establishment in this country, the economic establishment, and the political establishment are becoming very nervous. And I mean this very sincerely. Joe Biden is a threat -- I've known Joe for a very long time, nope, nope, nope, nope, Joe is a decent guy. He is just wrong on the issues.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: And President Trump is calling out the moderate Democrats' plan to back Biden to slow down Sanders.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: It is being rigged against Crazy Bernie. Crazy Bernie is going to go crazy, crazy. I think Crazy Bernie is going to be more crazier when they see what they are doing. I called it a long time ago. Mayor Pete, he put out. She dropped out. It sounds like they made a deal, you know?  They both supported Sleepy Joe. You know why? They made a deal. You know why? Quid pro quo, that's why, quid pro quo.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: And so there you have it, Jesse, the set up tonight. We're going to get some results. Mike Bloomberg is on the ballot but will that matter?  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, it will matter in some states because he's polling pretty well. We will see if it is a real poll or if he just bought the poll. I think Biden did get a good bounce of South Carolina. I just can't figure out whether it is actually Joe-mentum balance or it's a never-Bernie balance.  Because right now, it looks a little manufactured when you see the slew of endorsements come in perfectly timed close to South Carolina, especially after you get the deep state endorsement where you get Susan Rice Brennan and James Comey endorsed Biden in 24 hours. Wow, that tells you pretty much everything you need to know.  Biden has been racking up all these endorsements, but he's also been racking up an alarming amount of gas, which tells me this. The man is obviously deteriorating, and the Democrats are taking full advantage of it. If Biden becomes president, is he really going to be the president? Is he going to be a figurehead and people behind the scenes pulling strings?  That's what it looks like to me, because the Biden presidency is a restoration. Everybody gets their job back at the NSC, at the State Department, at the White House. They can control all the money and they can control all the power. They don't want a revolution with Bernie Sanders. They just want their power back. They want full control.  Bernie does not give them control because Bernie cannot be controlled. And that's why he is such a big threat. Right now, it looks like this was timed perfectly. And the difference between 2016 and now is Trump was unstoppable. Bernie Sanders is stoppable, because of the fact that he doesn't have as big of a movement, and because of the rules in the Democratic process.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: -- passed positions over the past 40 years.  WATTERS: So you're going to get to a situation in the convention where you're going to have a regional split. Because tonight, it looks -- with a few exceptions, Biden is going to win mostly the south and the red states. And Bernie's going to win the coast and the north. So you're going to have the regional split and an ideological split. And I am going to love watching them fight.  PERINO: Did you see today, Katie, that Jim Comey who -- former FBI director endorsed Biden and the Biden campaign said no thanks, we don't want it?  (CROSSTALK)  KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS HOST: We don't want any endorsements from people who have been testifying in front of Congress about breaking the rules or leaking classified information and endorsing our campaign. But when it comes to these new endorsements that Joe Biden has received in recent days, it really -- you know, voters don't typically like to be told what to do, right?  And so they're going to decide whether they think Joe Biden is a viable candidate on electability, or if they think that Bernie Sanders has more energy. And also, the issue that has been brought up a lot in recent days is has the DNC done enough to rebuild the trust with the Bernie wing of the party. And it's increasingly clear again that they have not.  They claim that they were going to do conversations with the far left wing of the party that they were going to clean some of the rules up. They did change some things. But in terms of the results that came out of Iowa or the non-results moving into how we go with this. And then Joe Biden now having all these people backing with the full weight of the establishment, it tears open that wound that they have been trying to fix since the --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: Now Juan, I'm going to save your commentary until after Greg, because I want Greg to look at this. Hillary Clinton weighed in today.  (CROSSTALK)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: In the campaign, in the documentary, you talk about his campaign from 2016. And you call it, quote, ""Just baloney, and I feel so bad that people got sucked into it."" Do you still feel that way now?  HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES: Sure. Yeah, I mean, you know, that was my authentic opinion now, and that's my authentic opinion now.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: It is great to have to have an adjective for your opinion.  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: It is interesting, because I will be honest and say that I would probably prefer Joe Biden over Bernie Sanders. I would, but not anymore, OK? I might encourage everybody not to vote for Joe Biden for simply dragging Beto back into the spotlight. I don't need to see squiggy again, right? I mean, I don't need to --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: This poutty, attention-seeking goofball waving his hands. That is why I coined the new term Good Biden.  WATTERS: Oh.  GUTFELD: Simply, where am I looking? Where am I looking?  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Similarly, when Hillary bashes Bernie, it makes me like Bernie more, because Bernie -- like it or not, he is an authentic social justice warrior. And she is the artificial. She is the fake social justice warrior. He -- she is the artificial sweetener to Bernie's raw sugarcane. How is that? How is that? So her endorsement is likely a blemish on the blue dress that is Biden.  Now, I have two more points. What kills me about Mayor Pete's endorsement, this was a guy who was super sanctimonious sat up -- stood on the debate stage and said, well, we look at this stage, all we see are white men. And where is the diversity, right? And then he endorses the whitest, oldest, most establishment male you could ever find. So he is a hypocrite --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Joe is Chris Matthews with a better parking space. Lastly, to Jesse's point, the other problem for Joe is people see the ploy that he switched from trumping the evil nemesis to Biden -- to Bernie being the evil nemesis. So you kind of see a mob action forming against Bernie. And if you scare the establishment that bad, there's got to be something good about it.  You're cool, even though you know that Bernie is, you know, not qualified, but the fact that he scares the establishment makes you like him.  PERINO: But Juan, talk about maybe it is also the Democrats realizing that they don't want to lose elections for the next generation if they have somebody that they think, at the top of the ticket, is going to be a disaster.  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Right. I mean, I heard that there might be operation chaos in South Carolina. And listening to my Republican colleagues, I can see that there is an operation chaos right now in terms of the right wing punditocracy. I mean, you guys all of a sudden -- you talk about somebody going crazy --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: -- and waving their hands. It sounds like you are talking about Donald Trump. But listen, I will just try to take us in a more serious vein for a second. Because I think actually some people are tuning in for news.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Thank you, Juan.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: I wouldn't listen. Anyway, I think there are only a few things that you should really watch as you tune in tonight. And I hope you tune in because we're going to have some great coverage. But I think one on the more interesting things is whether or not Sanders can knock out Warren in Massachusetts, because if he beats her there, I don't know where she's got to go.  So I think that's one thing. And the second thing is Texas. Can Joe Biden really match Bernie Sanders? There is a lot of early voting there also in California. And California is the be all and end all of what we're going to be watching tonight, because there are so many -- 400 plus delegates to be awarded. And right now, again, so much early voting and it favors Sanders.  But what we have seen over the last few days is just an earthquake in terms of Democratic Party politics. And now, you have groups like 538, the predictors, even some of the folks here at FOX, saying it looks like not only could Joe Biden come close to holding down what Sanders can claim from California. In some cases, he might win the total delegate count for the night.  Because as Jesse was saying, you look at Virginia, North Carolina, Arkansas, Alabama, Tennessee, the only state, by the way that Michael Bloomberg looks to have any chance to even get above the 15 percent at the moment is Oklahoma. So this is now -- the question is what happens to Warren? What happens to Bloomberg?  But the idea that this was going to be a knockout punch of a day, Super Tuesday that was going to settle this nomination is not true anymore, at least according --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: They're asking me to --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: -- keep going another five minutes. Please, that was so exciting.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: We are not good enough.  PERINO: You guys, be nice to each other.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: -- authentic opinion.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: Katie, do you mind?  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: I'll come right back to you. Much more to come on THE FIVE, our Super Tuesday coverage just getting started, up next, Greg's take on Joe Biden's latest campaign trail gaffs. And make sure to tune in for our special election coverage hosted by Brett and Martha right after THE FIVE tonight.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: More interesting moments. Moments after getting endorsed for Democrats fleeing the slow-rolling disaster, Joe Biden quickly inspired confidence in their decision.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  BIDEN: We hold these truths to be self-evident. All men created by -- you know the thing. Look, tomorrow is Super Thursday. And I want to thank you all. I tell you what. I'm rushing ahead, aren't I?  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: As always, blame it on the Russian. I wonder if Trump noticed.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: Tomorrow, voters in states across the nation will head to the polls for Super Tuesday, not Super Thursday. Oh, he said Super Thursday. You can't do these things. He is constantly naming the wrong state. It's great to be in the state of Ohio, no, no, no. I'm sorry. You are in North Carolina. I honestly don't think he knows what office he is running for.  But they're going to put him into a home and other people are going to be running the country. And they're going to super left radical crazies.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Now, everyone makes gaffs, but Joe's multiply faster than rabbits. And while sometimes Trump's words are shocking, they don't hint at an underlying decline. Biden reminds me that he's getting any younger, let alone wiser. And it makes you wonder what the endorsements from Amy, Pete, and Beto really mean. Is Joe leading a parade of enthusiastic support, or is this a gurney race to push Joe across the finish line on a stretcher?  He faces a bigger challenge, though. He is a moderate by today's loony left standards. But his one and only idea is get rid of that orange mini. That is not a vision. That is a complaint. Meanwhile, Bernie is the outsider whose vision is strong despite being wrong. That's why he attracts the youth, the mad, and the crazy.  In a world where we idealize the bold, the radical is just sexier than a bumbling moderate, even a radical with ear hair. It is not fair. It is not smart. But it's life. Maybe the Dems haven't thrown all their weight behind the fantasy of impeachment, they'd see this coming? Instead, the Dems are stuck with three voting choices, two cranky old men and sleeping in. I put my money on the snooze button.  Dana, Dana, Dana, what did we learn from 2016 Rick Perry? Never start something you can't finish. Remember I got three things.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: -- I have some things.  GUTFELD: So never start -- a really famous quote.  PERINO: If you can't nail the quote.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: If you can't nail the quote, get off the vote.  PERINO: Trey Gowdy on Saturday night said sometimes it's like watching a chainsmoker fill up his gas tank, like, waiting for, like, the disaster. And I think -- look, it is concerning, right? And I would imagine that his campaign is like, wow, if we are really going to be the frontrunner, can he handle it? It is a lot of energy.  Now, winning sometimes give you pep in your step. But the other thing about Joe Biden, it is like people seem to think he is charming. And I get it. Oh, he meant Thursday. They are super forgiving.  GUTFELD: I think so too, because we always have somebody like that in our lives, Jesse.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Every day, you say something that I go --  WATTERS: Thank you, Greg. That was me yesterday. I was listening to Limbaugh today.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: Joe pulled the plug on the quote because he didn't want to say under God in front of a Democratic audience. He said that was maybe the smartest thing Joe Biden said in a very long time. But listen, Bernie Sanders is a mess. I don't even think Bernie knows if he can run the country. Bernie is like a heckler at a game that just yells out, you bum.  And you don't make the heckler the manager. You just give the guy popcorn and pat him on the head. This guy knows he can't win. And everybody knows - - you can't blame the Democratic Party for rigging it against him. If I was a Democrat, I would rig the heck out of this thing. You don't want the guy anywhere near the White House.  Meanwhile, Joe Biden is less coherent than Crazy Bernie. And he can't even survive a good news cycle without racking up gaffs. He doesn't know where he is, what numbers are coming out of his mouth, who he's even talking to. It is a lackluster candidate with a bad campaign. I have never seen a Joe Biden bumper sticker, have any of you?  I've never seen a Joe Biden crowd. I mean, he can't get through an interview. The guy is slow, and he is slowing down. And it's not a good look for Joe. But the good news is, we get to watch the whole thing unfold. And it is a beautiful thing.  GUTFELD: Juan, do you think Amy, Pete, and Beto were promised anything? Could this be a quid pro quo cubed?  WILLIAMS: I think -- I think you guys should stay away from quid pro quos. I think we heard a lot about with Mr. Trump and the Ukraine. But I think that Amy Klobuchar -- Amy Klobuchar said explicitly that she was promised nothing, that she just wanted to do what she felt was the right thing to do in order to unify the party and prepare to defeat to Donald Trump.  I will say this. I'm struck that President Trump and clearly your delight in these gaffs, indicate again the Republicans are most worried about Joe Biden. They don't want to run against him. That is why the president sent Rudy to the Ukraine to dig up dirt on, guess who, Joe Biden. And I have the feeling that Hunter Biden's name is going to bubble up any second.  I see already that in Congress, they are planning more hearings. I think that what the right-wing is intent on is they like to mock Joe Biden. But I have to tell you again. Democrats do --- I'm going to use Dana's word, think that it is charming that he is authentic, right? That is something you value greatly, Jesse. The he is authentic. He is real. He's someone that you can touch and know.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: It is also the case. And I think very clearly that it's not just my opinion, because what do we see in the polls, especially polls in South Carolina? Democrats don't care about this stuff. It is Republicans who care about it, because they want -- the bullying, the mocking, the berating.  GUTFELD: No Democrats are pointing this out, OK, Katie.  PAVLICH: Well, OK, the Joe Biden's appeal at this point is that he's a statesman. He's the guy who's been in Washington for decades so he knows what he's doing and we can trust him to be someone who is reliable to be a commander in chief. And when he continually looks incompetent with basic things, when it comes to a one-on-one match up with Donald Trump, is going to have a hard time trying to make a case to people throughout the country who are liking the economy, who think that President Trump has done a decent job.  Who think he is a competent commander in chief. Joe Biden's going to have a very hard time doing that. When it comes to Bernie Sanders, I think that he is a threat as well. I don't think you can underestimate where he's going to go if her were to win the nomination, which is looking more like the convention as we go into tonight.  But the coalition that he had coming out of Nevada is one that Republicans are looking. Latinos, young women, young people, and if the whole Democratic establishment would get behind him, he certainly would have more of a machine then he does right now. So I would not underestimate his ability. And the Trump campaign's research on him as well, they are probably doing a lot on both Biden and Bernie Sanders.  GUTFELD: OK, then. Next on THE FIVE, a Democratic in Colorado supporting calls for Trump supporter's to be infected with the Coronavirus.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WILLIAMS: Major concerns over the spread of the Coronavirus. Here in the United States, the number of cases growing by the day. It's now 100. And the virus has killed nine Americans so far, all of them in the state of Washington. President Trump touring the National Institutes of Health today, here is what he had to say earlier.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: We have made tremendous progress. I know you are dealing with other nations to help them out because they really got hit, some of them very badly. And we are talking to them all. So -- and we are making decisions as to whether or not we are allowed to travel there, allowed to travel. We have been pretty severe on those restrictions, but I guess we did the right thing by being --  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: Plus, the growing controversy in Denver, a Democratic councilwoman tweeting that she stands, quote, ""in solidarity"", end quote, with a Twitter user who said this is so awful. If I do get Coronavirus, I am attending MAGA rally I can, end quote. The councilwoman saying her response was pure sarcasm and she was meaning to draw attention to the Trump administration's poor handling of the crisis.  Anyway, and let's get back to the news about Coronavirus. Dana, the president has tried to calm the nation. And he said, you know, we got this under control. Things are not going to get worse. We're not going to have more cases. But today, more cases and things got worse.  PERINO: Well -- mean, at the briefings that they have been having this week, they've said it is likely that you will have more people that are infected. And the problem that we have found in Washington State is that -- especially at this nursing home where people's immune systems were already compromised and they're suffering from some sort of illness when they contracted it.  It's very hard to fight the disease. And we don't have the vaccine yet. And I think that because that the administration has done, I think, a pretty good job of explaining America has the best public health system in the world. We are doing what we can. We are trying to get ahead of it. We've have done some things already that have slowed it down.  That gives space for somebody like the woman in Denver to make a joke, or to be able to say with sarcasm, or to be able to -- to kind of joke about it. Let me tell you. In South Korea where they had 600 new cases just yesterday, they are not laughing. They've had to get the military out. They're doing the spraying of the -- I don't know what they are spraying --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: -- disinfectant or some sort of thing to try to kill it. And in Italy, like, nobody is laughing. Like, it is not funny. And in the United States, hopefully we will not get to a point where we have more cases. We might, but we also have the means to be able deal with it a lot better than any other country.  WILLIAMS: Greg, stock market took another dive today. It went up yesterday. It's down today. So it looks like the investors are saying they don't like what's going on.  GUTFELD: No. This is what happens in a world of unknowns. And the more we know stuff, the calmer things will be, which I'm an optimist about that that we will get more information. Things will get better. We might find out that this is a very contagious but non-lethal disease overall. And at by the end of this month, half of us will have it and treat it like something mild.  We don't know that. The councilwoman should apologize. She should apologize right away, and people will probably accept it because it was not sarcasm. She was supporting the idea and it was a gross idea. The real challenge and Bill Gates has talked about this, is how our society views protective measures.  When we see the media calling restrictions, travel restrictions, racist, that kind of virtue signaling creates fatalities. China was able to cut down the infections by being highly restrictive because they're a different kind of culture. But Bill Gates makes this point. The measures that can stop a pandemic might conflict with our do-good precious liberal assumptions. And a pandemic requires the strict parents, not the loving parent.  And the thing about our government -- our government and our democracy is we've always had a really good combination of the strict and the loving, the respect for individuals but the rule of law. In this case, you need to be -- we need to be grounded. We need the strict parent to ground us if it's for a month or what. And the loving parent has to sit back and say you take this.  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: You know, Jesse, you got kids, and I saw today in New York City that one school said, oh, one of the parents had been on a business trip into Asia so we're going to just shut down the school altogether. I went to the Knicks game last night with Mr. Ed Henry, by the way.  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Oh, and they won. You should go more often.  WILLIAMS: But anyway, huge crowd but some people with the mask.  WATTERS: Yes. You want to know how I really feel about the coronavirus, Juan? If I get it, I'll beat it. I'm not lying. It's called the power of positive thinking. And I think America needs to wake up to that. I live in Manhattan. I got off work the other night, went straight into the subway, Asian guy sits down next to me mask on. What do I do? Finish the ride. Then I go home and I ordered Chinese food. I'm not afraid of the coronavirus and no one else should be that afraid either.  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: You want to hold my hand?  WATTERS: No, not yet. I have people calling me from -- in the middle of the country, their property surrounded by acres. They live in the middle of nowhere and they're asking me about the coronavirus. Are you crazy? What are they scared for? Nine people have died. That's tragic, but it's tiny. It's a tiny, infinitesimal amount of people. So, I'm not selling stocks, I'm not stockpiling canned goods. Greg, as I always say, I'd rather die than you can good. Wash your hands, people. Don't get sneezed on. And cancel your trips to infected countries.  And if you're at risk in this country, and you have flu-like symptoms, you quarantine yourself, you call a doctor, and you get a test. If you're going out to the mall, eating at the food court, exposing everybody like an idiot, you deserve to have charges pressed against you. And that's how I really feel. This is the best country in the world to get coronavirus. If you get into North Korea, they'll probably shoot you dead.  WILLIAMS: All right.  WATTERS: We should be lucky we live in this country.  PERINO: OK.  WILLIAMS: Katie, just very quickly.  KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: I don't know if I can follow that.  WILLIAMS: I don't know what to say. You know, I love him and I just want to protect him. But let me just say, if people stop going to the mall or the food court and not spending money, that hurts the economy.  PAVLICH: But that's why what this Democratic in Denver said is so awful because this affects people's lives, people get very sick, they're quarantined for months at a time, sometimes. It costs the entire economy money. People have to cancel trips to see family or vacations they've had plan for a very long time. So wishing disease on another human being for any reason is pretty disgusting.  GUTFELD: Unless it's Jesse.  PAVLICH: Unless it's Jesse.  WILLIAMS: Stop. No, no, no.  PAVLICH: Prove us all wrong.  PERINO: He's got the brainpower --  WATTERS: Go to the food court. I'm saying if you have symptoms, don't go to the food court.  WILLIAMS: All right.  GUTFELD: No, I'm saying you could --  WATTERS: I was very clear.  GUTFELD: You could beat it is what I'm saying.  WILLIAMS: Yes, optimism.  WATTERS: If I get it, I'll beat it.  WILLIAMS: Yes.  WATTERS: I will.  WILLIAMS: All right, straight ahead on THE FIVE, billionaire Mike Bloomberg, he's fighting back after some Democrats pressure him to get out of this 2020 race. That's next right here on THE FIVE.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: Mike Bloomberg is feeling the heat from Democrats in the media. They want the billionaire to pack it up and drop out of the race to help Sleepy Joe. Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JIMMY KIMMEL, COMEDIAN: It seems like -- it seems like you don't like him that much.  SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: True. But it's not -- it's not personal. It's just everything about it.  BETO O'ROURKE (D), FORMER UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE: I don't sense the grassroots support for Bloomberg. I would think if he does not perform well today, that he bows out tomorrow.  JOE SCARBOROUGH, HOST, MSNBC: If Bernie Sanders ends up winning this, and in part, because Bloomberg has peeled off votes from Joe Biden, the takeover of a Democratic socialist in the Democratic Party in 2020, that will all be on Michael Bloomberg shoulders.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: The former New York City mayor spent over a half-billion dollars and could end up being branded the candidate who gave Democrats Bernie Sanders. But Mini Mike Bloomberg refuses to cave.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Other moderates in the race have dropped out to clear path for Joe Biden.  MIKE BLOOMBERG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Yes. And if Joe dropped out, he would -- they would take away -- Joe is taking votes away from me. And I think that is true. And --  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But you're also taking votes away from Joe Biden.  BLOOMBERG: Well, it goes in both directions. Have you asked Joe whether he's going to drop out? I have no intention of dropping out. We're in it to win it.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: Dana, he's not very good at this. I have to think maybe if he didn't even do a debate, the numbers might be bigger.  PERINO: No, I have -- I have friends who say that absolutely, he just should have never done anything like public, and he probably would have done better off in the polls because -- just by the ads. The thing is, why would Joe Biden drop out? Joe Biden just won big time in South Carolina and got all these endorsements.  It's like, this young reporter was at a -- I think it was the same event with Bloomberg and she asked kind of some more question like you can't possibly get the number of delegates. And he says, I don't see that -- how do you think that's possible? And she because of math. And it was -- it was great.  Of course, Andrew Yang talks about that. Also, with Elizabeth Warren, I do think it's a little bit personal. Like she doesn't like billionaires, like we get it, you don't like the rich people. But Mayor Bloomberg endorsed Scott Brown in the senate race that she had against him and I don't think she's ever gotten over that.  WATTERS: I just can't believe they put her on a late-night show. I mean, is that going to rate in your opinion?  GUTFELD: Who?  WATTERS: Liz Warren?  GUTFELD: Yes, they're like -- they all clap each other on the back. They're all in the same club. So who cares?  WATTERS: I'm not tuning in for that.  GUTFELD: I like -- you know, I watched last night's Town Hall. Fantastic. Probably the best Town Hall I ever saw. Fox News, Martha and Bret Baier.  PERINO: Yes.  GUTFELD: Yes. Anyway, Bloomberg said, he's not really bothered by Trump's policies. He just doesn't like his style or his manner. So, he's basically saying and some I don't like the boss. So, Bloomberg looks at Trump the way Bloomberg's employees look at Bloomberg, right? It's like, he's OK with Trump's policies.  He's -- the thing is he is helping Bernie by sticking in. And I think what he's thinking is what if he drops out and Bernie still wins? That's what bothers him. He's afraid if he drops out, and that doesn't stop anything.  But I think what he's banking on is that America feels the way he does about Trump. Like they're just -- that's --  PAVLICH: Well, all his friends do.  GUTFELD: Yes. All his friends do. So everybody must feel exhausted by Trump's tweets, and that's going to carry him over. But it doesn't -- if the economy's doing well, then I'm sorry -- what's his name again, Bloomberg?  WATTERS: Yes, Mini.  GUTFELD: Sorry, Mini.  WATTERS: I can't believe Greg has gone home twice this week and watch the Amy Klobuchar Town Hall and the Mike Bloomberg.  GUTFELD: That was last -- Klobuchar was last week.  WATTERS: I mean, you are really loyal town hall viewer.  GUTFELD: You know what, I'm watching also -- I'm going to watch the Trump one tomorrow. Is it tomorrow?  PERINO: Thursday.  GUTFELD: Thursday is tomorrow in other countries.  PERINO: That's true.  GUTFELD: Yes. Stop asking me questions. Let's move on to somebody else, Jesse.  WATTERS: Wow. I've never seen you give up airtime before.  WATTERS: If I know that's how it worked, I would have done it before. What do you think, Juan?  WILLIAMS: So I mean -- so I think this the story with Bloomberg is so interesting. You know, when I was coming up, they used to teach reporters, that money was the mother's milk of politics, money and name I.D. And if you just look at the money, you said he personally spent half a billion. I didn't think it was that much. But I mean, between him and Tom Steyer, they may have spent that much, right?  WATTERS: It's three-quarters of the billion if you combine Steyer and Bloomberg.  WILLIAMS: All right, so my point to you is, wow, what happened here? I mean, clearly, a lot of Bloomberg's money has been anti-Trump advertising, but it's gotten his name out there, you know, like Mike and all the rest of it. And I don't think that he's in position to do anything tonight. Maybe as I said earlier, a little bit in Oklahoma, get over the qualification threshold 15 percent. But I just Don't say it.  Now, the premise of his campaign was Joe Biden will implode and the middle will be open and I will walk in as the grand savior, right? Well, guess what, Joe Biden is strutting and doing fine, just won big and looks to have very good prospects tonight according to the pollsters. So what is going on with Mike Bloomberg?  WATTERS: Money can't buy you love. Katie?  GUTFELD: Yes, you can.  PAVLICH: But it's -- but it's also -- like Joe Biden wins won primary and everyone expects everyone else to get out of the race because he won once? I mean, Michael Bloomberg doesn't owe Joe Biden anything. He's only been in the race for four months. He's been able to get -- his money has gotten him higher in the polls without having to be present, without having to knock on the doors personally. We'll see how that goes moving forward.  But this idea now that everybody has to back Joe Biden when he clearly hasn't proven that he's worthy of the nomination at this point, hasn't locked it down with his performance, I think it's interesting that everybody is demanding that they back Joe in the establishment.  WATTERS: Yes. I can't see him knocking on doors. He knocks you go to the door. You look through the people. You can't see anything.  PERINO: It happens to me all the time.  WATTERS: Our predictions for Super Tuesday and much, much more straight ahead on THE FIVE.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PAVLICH: Welcome back. Let's get to our Super Tuesday final thoughts and predictions. Juan, you got to go first because you were the Democrat here.  WILLIAMS: Oh, is that right? OK.  PAVLICH: What do you think is going to happen tonight.  WILLIAMS: This is unusual. I would say things change fast and politics, Katie. You know, a week ago at this table, I think people were, wow, Joe Biden serious trouble, especially after Nevada when Sanders over-performed with Latino voters. But I think now let me offer restraint projection that Joe now has a 50/50 chance to beat Bernie Sanders for the nomination. And if I'm not restrained, I'd say it's even better than 50/50.  And one thing I would say is that given the fluidity of American politics in this Democratic Party process, you have every reason to tune in to Fox and watch because the decision desk here tonight, the Fox polling, the Fox people who bring you the latest news are keeping you in touch with what is a fascinating novel. I've never seen American politics, especially in this populist era, so dynamic.  PAVLICH: The best in the business. Dana, it'll be interesting to watch how the narrative flows tonight because the early states that close on the East Coast will be more Biden friendly states. But then later in the night, Bernie may pick up some more delegates.  PERINO: Oh, yes. That's a great -- that's a great point. You think of somebody like Mayor Pete who didn't really get to have the bounce out of Iowa from the media because of that disaster. And then Bernie Sanders capitalizing on a New Hampshire and Nevada, and then Biden doing that now.  So, Bernie states that he would do better than tonight or on the West Coast. And in California, we might not even know the results for a couple of weeks. So yes, I think that all makes a lot of sense. I'm watching tonight. I think that Bloomberg will not get number one anywhere. But I'm looking to see if he gets number two anywhere.  So for example, can Bloomberg get number two in Virginia or Texas ahead of Bernie and what would that tell us? And then also, if you get to number two, after Bernie and beats Biden in a couple of places, that dynamic of those two battling it out might continue for a while.  PAVLICH: Jesse, predictions?  WATTERS: I think Juan and many Democrats are mistaking Bernie hatred for Biden love. That there is no real Biden movement in America. It's a movement against the Bernie movement. And I think tonight maybe you'll see how strong Biden is or is not. I do agree with you that I think Bloomberg is soft as poll numbers. I think he'll underperform. To your point about Beto, I was thinking about this today. We have not seen Adam Schiff on television for a very long time.  PERINO: You miss him?  GUTFELD: Good point.  WATTERS: And it has been so delightful, and I think that's the best part about this primary process is Adam Schiff is not on T.V. So thank you, Democrats.  PAVLICH: Thanks for reminding him he needs to get to a camera. Will be seeing him shortly.  GUTFELD: Well, it's odd that you bring him up because he is the reason why they're having a problem because he steered this party -- he was like a guy -- he's like your stupid friend that convinced -- that convinces you to go on a really long road trip. That's what he did with impeachment. He convinced the Democratic Party to go on a really long road trip, and then he ditched you in a small town because he met some chick.  Anyway, you guys are much of team players when it comes to Fox. Tonight, I'll be watching Fox News on T.V.  PERINO: I'll be on it.  GUTFELD: I'll be on -- but see, I'm actually going to be watching it --  PERINO: And tweeting positively about me.  GUTFELD: Yes. And FoxNews.com will be on my phone and Fox Nation will be on my iPad, so it'll be all there. I think the real story here, what -- who control tonight, the puppet master Barack Obama sitting on his paddleboard, made a call and said OK, everybody, now you got to do it, and hang up. And he's like, you know what he is? He's like Mrs. Garrett in Facts of Life.  When the girls are getting out of control, he comes downstairs, he says OK, this is how it's going to be. That's what the story is.  PERINO: He's like Mrs. Garrett.  GUTFELD: Yes. Barack Obama is the Mrs. Garrett of politics.  PERINO: Got it.  PAVLICH: I'm actually interested to see how the Beto endorsement actually plays out in Texas because the timing of that is interesting considering Beto did well against Ted Cruz and Joe Biden is being caught by Bernie Sanders in Texas. So, whether he still has any poll after his presidential run, we will see. But the timing of that is interesting. ""ONE MORE THING"" up next.  GUTFELD: Yes, ""ONE MORE THING."" We didn't have one yesterday.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PERINO: It's time now for ""ONE MORE THING."" Juan?  WILLIAMS: I've got to change the mood a little bit here because we have some very sad news out of Tennessee today. 25 people are dead after tornadoes tour across Central Tennessee. The damage in Nashville which is just a great town, it's unbelievable. Take a look. Fox News Meteorologist Janice Dean estimated the city was hit by a tornado with winds possibly as high as 165 miles an hour.  The historic Germantown neighborhood in Nashville, as well as the trendy East Nashville area, saw roofs torn off of homes, office buildings, trees uprooted. At one airport, you're looking at it now, the terminal and the planes were left looking like debris. It's hard to make sense of the pictures.  Governor Bill Lee summed it up by calling the situation heartbreaking. President Trump is scheduled to visit the area on Friday.  PERINO: That was incredible news to wake up to. And they've already -- the community there is so strong. They're already helping each other out and we'll be there to help them as well. Mine is a book -- wait, we'll have this. Dana's Book Club. Oh, there's Jasper. Everybody has missed him. This is a book you're going to want to get. It's called Pearls of Wisdom: Little Pieces of Advice that go a Long Way.  This is advice from former First Lady Barbara Bush, the late former First Lady, and it was put together by Jean Becker, a longtime speechwriter for her and the chief of staff to George HW Bush's post-presidency. And she gathered all of this advice from about 100 friends, colleagues, children, grandchildren, put this all together. It's really wonderful.  One of the pieces of advice is to choose happy, which I know all of us do. Right, Greg? Choose happy. Choose happy. It's a wonderful book. I think it makes a great like graduation gift, Mother's Day. I loved it, and I can't wait to read more of it. So that was my ""ONE MORE THING."" Jesse?  WATTERS: Just in time for Super Tuesday, Dana. We have the Fox News shop, Election 2020 democracy collection. Here we go. So you get a hat, you get a mug, and if you get them together, you get a free stress ball.  PERINO: Oh, nice. We need those.  WATTERS: Juan, you can squeeze this until Election Day.  WILLIAMS: Thank you, my friend.  PERINO: This is actually a pretty good ball.  WILLIAMS: I could throw a curveball.  WATTERS: Yes, you could. Head over to shop.foxnews.com and get yours today. And remember, it's in your hands, not the stress ball, the election.  PERINO: The election and the stress ball. Greg?  GUTFELD: All right, let's do this. I haven't done this week.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Animals are great. Animals are great. Animals are great.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: We know animals are great. You know what's not great? Soccer. Soccer is so easy to play that even fish can play soccer. Here is a team that is playing soccer. Look how they get -- you know, they're not allowed to use their hands.  PAVLICH: Oh, really? Nice.  GUTFELD: But they can use your fins and they're actually very good. They're actually going to feel the Olympic team. We're not sure if they're going to be there for the Olympic.  PERINO: Wow, they score. They scored.  GUTFELD: Yes, they're very good. They're very good. Yes, yes.  PERINO: That is so cool.  GUTFELD: By the way, you know that, that's the Gill's team. Someone just throw me off the bridge.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Animals are great. Animals are great. Animals are great.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: Katie?  PAVLICH: All right, well, I have good news for the space geeks out there. If you've always wanted to be an astronaut, now is your chance. NASA is accepting applications for their 2021 class of astronauts. And if you make the cut, you may be able to live on the International Space Station and explore Mars by the 2030.  So keep in mind that in 2015, 18,300 people applied to be astronauts. It was the last time that application is open, and only 11 were selected, and you must have an advanced degree in science and technology.  PERINO: These are good looking people.  PAVLICH: And you must be a pilot. So good luck to all the astronauts.  GUTFELD: That's discrimination. I'm not a pilot.  PERINO: So, Jesse, you're out.  WATTERS: I'm out.  PERINO: You're out.  WATTERS: I think -- is Adam Schiff a pilot? We should send him up there.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: I was going to say, you're a young man.  PERINO: Set your DVRs. Never miss an episode of THE FIVE.

61,FOX,"The media and Democrats push false Trump coronavirus narrative. In the world of fake news, we no longer have to worry about hoaxes. We now have to deal with 'hoax' hoaxes. On Friday, when President Trump called Democrats’ attempt to politicize coronavirus a “hoax,” how did the media portray that? That he was calling the virus itself a hoax. The Washington Post's Dana Milbank kicked it off with this: “Remember this moment: Trump, in South Carolina, just called the coronavirus a ‘hoax,’” Milbank wrote. CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS MAKING PLANS IN CASE CORONAVIRUS THREATENS CAPITOL HILL Politico lazily picked it up with this headline: ""Biden blasts Trump for calling coronavirus a ‘hoax.’” True, the “hoax hoax” spread like a virus to desperate Democratic candidates --  Joe Biden and also Mike Bloomberg trumpeting this lie, even though anyone who read Trump’s actual quote could see that it was B.S. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER But the media expects us not to do that. They hope our laziness will let hoaxing hacks like Milbank get away with their misinformation. And if you point out their lies, then CNN's hall monitors will accuse you of “politicizing” it, the ""I know you are but what am I"" school of debate that is then met with laughter. But even as there are hacks, there is hope, as better reporters now promptly call out these fake news viruses. After Bloomberg blasted Trump for ""calling it a hoax,"" reporter Scott Pelley stopped him. Pelley wasn't the only one. Others on Twitter quickly called out the lie, which forces the media to find another path to hammer those they hate. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP That's the problem with the media's bias. It's not so much contagious as it is incurable. The best defense? Washing your hands --- of them. Adapted from Greg Gutfeld’s monologue on “The Five” on Mar. 2, 2020.

62,FOX,"Fox News medical correspondent Dr. Marc Siegel joins 'The Five' to discuss outbreak concerns. This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" February 28, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: We have The Ragin Cajun in with us right now. He's been a very big critic, that is, General Russel Honore on how we have not exactly done well.  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino along with Emily Compagno, Geraldo Rivera, Jesse Watters, and annoying Greg Gutfeld. It's five o'clock in New York City.  (CROSSTALK)  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: You're not funny.  PERINO: And this is The Five.  President Trump commenting on the coronavirus just moments ago as there are now 62 confirmed cases in the United States. Here is the president.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We haven't lost anybody yet and hopefully we can keep that intact. There've been no deaths in the United States at all.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: The president also going after the media. Much more on that later.  But first, he's looking to loom large over another major Democratic primary. He set for a big rally in South Carolina in about two hours from now as Democrats get prepare to face off in the Palmetto State primary tomorrow.  The Democratic Party splintering as candidates continue to slam Bernie Sanders and warned that his message of socialism will doom the party's prospects in 2020.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  MICHAEL BLOOMBERG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I believe that if Bernie Sanders gets the nomination, he will lose to Donald Trump. He will make sure that the Senate stays in Republican hands. He will flip the House back to the Republicans, and even down ballot he's going to hurt the Democrats.  JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The fact that someone lists himself as an official independent adding to the Democratic except as president to run for the office of president, and then list himself as a socialist, that doesn't fly.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: But Bernie remains defiant on it all.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We are building a movement that cannot be stopped.  (APPLAUSE)  SANDERS: And when millions of people stand up and fight back, nothing on earth can stop us.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: Meanwhile, Joe Biden is looking for a game changer in South Carolina. Strong polling in the state is putting Biden in a good position but his campaign is still plagued by more gaffes, Biden fisting that he was never arrested in South Africa while trying to meet Nelson Mandela.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  BIDEN: And when I said arrested, I meant I was not able -- I was not able to move. The cops in Africa would not let me go with them, made me stay where I was. I guess, I wasn't arrested, I was stopped, I was not able to move where I wanted to go.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: We're going to get to all of it. I do want to play this sound for you though, from James Clyburn, the congressman from South Carolina who endorsed Joe Biden. This is what he had to say about Bernie Sanders.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  REP. JAMES CLYBURN (D-SC): I was in Texas about three weeks ago with Eddie Berniece Johnson doing the bank rift (ph) for her. I talked to the faith community down there and they were very, very concerned about whether or not you'll do something -- or have somebody on the ticket that will cause down ballot carnage.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: It's interesting that they are talking about down ballot carnage now, Greg, after Bernie Sanders was in full position to win in Iowa, and then in New Hampshire, and then in Nevada. South Carolina he might not be do that well but pulling the panic alarm now it seems a little bit late.  GUTFELD: This is the big lesson that we talk about again and again. That the Democrats had four years to prepare for this moment --  PERINO: Yes.  GUTFELD: -- and to beat this orange demon, apparently the worst human that's ever lived. And what did they do? They were like, instead of studying for the exam, they decided to play ""Fortnite"" in their underwear, they chased these phantoms of impeachment, and collusion, destruction.  And instead of like, devoting their intellectual energy to actually finding a candidate or figuring out a way behind-the-scenes or whatever to deal with Bernie -- I think the Dems -- you know how they always talk about voter suppression? They should worry about voter depression. Because when you look at how that feels --  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: I know.  GUTFELD: -- it is so flawed. The field is so flawed that you're not looking for a voting booth, you are looking for a bridge. And you're not going to go -- so I don't -- I think that like, there are going to be a lot of people that just aren't going to vote.  PERINO: Yes.  GUTFELD: Because it's going to be like, you know what, just give me, going to have Trump for another four years, we can deal with it in 2024. Life goes pretty fast.  PERINO: And now they're going to have all of these ads, Jesse, that shows somebody like Congressman Clyburn saying that the down ballot consequences of Bernie Sanders would include carnage.  WATTERS: Yes. Bernie didn't have a good week. I think his Cuba comments and then his math not adding up on 60 Minutes and then at the debate really made people think again what they are doing and that's why Democrats are rattled.  But Joe needs a big win in South Carolina because he's kind of running on fumes and his coalition really is soft. He was supposed to be the guy that was going to win white working-class voters and he's gotten walloped by everybody in the field on those issues on the first three primaries.  And he's supposed to turn out Hispanics and he lost by 30 points to Bernie in Nevada with Hispanics. He only beat Bernie by 10 percent with blacks in Nevada. So, he's not even spending any money on Super Tuesday. He's only spent only 600,000 on Super Tuesday.  PERINO: Yes.  WATTERS: Bernie has spent $15 million. Bernie has twice the amount of stamp he has --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: And Mayor Bloomberg --  WATTERS: It's going to be bad.  PERINO: -- has spent $600 million there.  WATTERS: That's right.  PERINO: Here -- Geraldo, I want you to listen to Joe Biden talking about how South Carolina could actually be kind of a starting point for him. let's listen to that.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  BIDEN: I've been deeply involved in this community, in the state. And I feel very good about it. I feel good about it from the beginning. It's been a launching pad for Barack and I believe it'll be the launching pad for me.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: South Carolina does punch above its weight in terms of this early states because it gets to be crunch time when you get there.  GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT-AT-LARGE: And I think that people are underestimating the impact South Carolina will have on the Biden candidacy. I believe that he will win decisively and that will change the conversation. The question is will anybody be focused on politics when we really only care about public health right now?  Public health and politics are the same story right now.  GUTFELD: Right.  RIVERA: And what people want to know is how would you deal -- they don't want to see Biden sniping at Trump right now, they don't want to see Bloomberg sniping at Trump. They don't want to see politicians -- I am deeply, deeply distressed by what Pelosi and Schumer did in attacking Trump and undermining the confidence we have in our public health system.  This is -- this is really, really bad. But I think that Biden can pull off a miracle here. This is rocky. He's a decent person. He's not my guy. You know, I would not vote for him -- or may be, I don't know if I vote for him.  But I think that he will as a result of South Carolina, black people specifically in South Carolina will carry the former vice president across the finish line with the momentum and that a report Super Tuesday even though as Jesse rightly points out he spent about $0.06.  PERINO: You know what --  (CROSSTALK)  EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS HOST: May I respond to that?  PERINO: OK.  COMPAGNO: So, just, if I can, African-Americans in South Carolina comprise 60 percent of that Democratic voting bloc and the most conservative of that bloc. And in the past week we've seen Biden lead in on average between four and 20 points and averaging 12.  So, you could argue that it's his to lose. But at the same time, did you guys see those two polls from CNN about from Texas and California about Bernie?  WATTERS: Yes, he's beating.  COMPAGNO: So, yes, like by a million.  WATTERS: Yes.  COMPAGNO: Twenty-one points in California and 9 in Texas.  PERINO: Yes.  COMPAGNO: So, you could argue Biden is saying that's going be my a launching pad, but will momentum really --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: Launching pad that --  COMPAGNO: -- will it -- will momentum be enough afterwards when we go to Super Tuesday with Bernie looking like the complete king of the --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: Can I get one last thing from Greg?  RIVERA: I see -- may I?  COMPAGNO: Yes.  RIVERA: I believe that South Carolina will affect those numbers. You are right about Texas and California, but because it is so close two days later --  COMPAGNO: Yes.  RIVERA: -- South Carolina, the news will all be South Carolina, South Carolina, then in Super Tuesday.  PERINO: Yes.  COMPAGNO: I think they are --  PERINO: I do want to ask Greg one last question about two people that we haven't mentioned.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: I'm busy tonight.  PERINO: Yes. You got a show.  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: Elizabeth Warren.  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: And Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Pete Buttigieg who actually did come in second in those two contests, but we haven't -- we kind of don't talk about him. Like, what's going on there with those two?  GUTFELD: Well, he's got to go back to school. Because you know, school starts, you know, -- he's going to be a sophomore in high school. You didn't know that, didn't you? I don't know. I think -- I mean, there's a lot of ego going on, on why people stay in these races. It was the same thing in 2016. It was hard to get people out of the race. You got to push them out.  PERINO: Well, a lot of race -- a lot of campaigns do not end because the candidate wants them to. It's because they run out of money.  WATTERS: Needs to go out a lot, though.  PERINO: I think on Wednesday you'll see this race narrow.  GUTFELD: Here's a dumb question because I don't know this. If millions of people are voting for Bernie Sanders, wouldn't they also vote for everyone with a D next to their name? That's why I don't understand about that --  RIVERA: I don't think so.  GUTFELD: No?  WATTERS: Some people go in and they split the ticket.  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: I think Trump got a lot of vote, Sanders voters --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: Or you could go in if you are a Democrat, like 18 -- in our Fox poll it said 18 percent of Democrats said they would never vote for Bernie or for Bloomberg. So, you could go in and you could vote for your senator and your congressman and just leave that one blank.  WATTERS: Those people are just crazy.  PERINO: All right. Next up, President Trump is responding to attacks from the Democrats and the media on how he's handling the coronavirus.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: Twenty-twenty Democrats and the media wasting no time playing coronavirus politics. They're trashing President Trump over his administration's response to the deadly virus.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, MSNBC HOST: The coronavirus crisis is going to get much worse for Donald Trump.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Should Americans trust President Trump to deal with this crisis?  BLOOMBERG: No. He has not prepared for a crisis like this.  JOE SCARBOROUGH, HOST, MSNBC: Our government is woefully ill-unprepared. It seems at least at this early stage.  BIDEN: No one takes the president's word for this thing. At a minimum, he exaggerates everything. And the idea that he's going to stand there and say everything is fine, don't worry, who's going to believe that?  O'DONNELL: He will probably stay physically healthy throughout the crisis but his mental health which is weak on his best day can only get much worse.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: And here's President Trump calling out the spears at the White House earlier today.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: I think that CNN is a very disreputable network. I think they're doing everything they can to instill fear in people and I think it's ridiculous.  Some of the Democrats are doing it the way it should be, but some of them are trying to gain political favor by saying a lot of untruths.  So, some people are giving us credit -- quiet. Some people are giving us credit for that, and some people aren't, but the only ones -- they don't mean it. It's political, it's politics.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: So, Greg, the president declared a national health emergency, he restricts the travel on China, he brings local and federal health officials together, he organizes a task force. He asks for billions of dollars, he does the quarantines, accelerates the vaccines. What do the Democrats want him to do that he's not doing?  GUTFELD: And they're actually not even getting to that place of offering an idea. Like saying here's what I -- they can't even -- because the fact that he did act so fast that he gave the hospital's time to prepare --  WATTERS: Right.  GUTFELD: -- and that's the most important thing. As you saw this emergency unfold, you saw CNN and you saw the New York Times get their biased mode going. They -- you could see the obvious agenda before your eyes. Then when you pointed out, right, what did they do? They cause -- they accuse you --  WATTERS: Yes.  GUTFELD: -- of politicizing when you go, Brian Stelter is like secretly saying, you know, this could be it. And then Kaitlan Collins saying let's call it the Trump virus. When you accuse them and show their naked attempts at trying Trump to this they go, you're politicizing this. The -- I mean, I can't use the language that I want to use to describe them.  WATTERS: Geraldo will.  GUTFELD: Geraldo, because you can get away with it.  WATTERS: Geraldo, why do you think --  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: A gutter feeding punks.  WATTERS: That's exactly right. So, as Greg mentioned, you know, they said that the task force was too white.  RIVERA: What?  WATTERS: They said the travel restrictions were Xenophobic. You know, they said that cut the CD funding -- they never cut any CDC funding. And if you say you guys are politicizing it, they say, no, you're politicizing it. How does that make sense?  RIVERA: Anyone who exacerbates the fear, the real epidemic of fear, which is the real epidemic, not the virus yet in this country is, like I said, a gutter feeding, you know --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Scumbag.  RIVERA: -- scumbag.  GUTFELD: There you go.  RIVERA: They really are. Scumbag is a good word. Let me -- I want to read you something.  WATTERS: Please.  RIVERA: So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. Nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror, which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat in advance, 1933, FDR first inaugural address.  We have now a politician feeding fear, politicians for their own temporary advantage to cut the president in any way they can, to distinguish themselves from their rivals in this Democratic catfight. They say and do things that have helped tank the stock market. I've lost a fortune this week. Itis very, very disgraceful.  GUTFELD: But you had a fortune to lose.  RIVERA: Yes. Sure. But I mean, this is very, very unsettling. And anyone who is exacerbating the unease that the American people feel, shame on them. Reject them. Reject them. They are nothing.  GUTFELD: Wow.  WATTERS: I have to pixelate that.  GUTFELD: No, we're live.  COMPAGNO: It's going to be a --  WATTERS: So, you think this would be a time where news organizations would try to tell you the facts, give you the context, and not instill fear, but that's not what we are getting.  COMPAGNO: No, it's not. And to your point, this is exactly what turns people off about politics, is these guys using a public health crisis or a public health situation to advance their own careers, to further their own team.  It's what makes people turn off those news organizations because they need actual facts. I'm not getting my news from there. I'm not getting my actual facts. We're not getting the here's you wash your hands, you take that certain steps, the people at most risk are the infirm and the elderly. The average human will likely get it and won't be affected.  I mean, there are things that are important to disseminate, not that I'm the expert but that I'm -- I am responsible for transmitting accurate messaging and information. And to your point about the president, what else do we want our president to do? I would say take executive, decisive action and have a reassuring countenance. Right?  Do I want my president running around screaming like, we're all going to die? No. I love that he was like, there's, we are going to be OK. And by the way, I use my authority to take these actions that will ensure that the experts in the public health field in this country will secure that, will execute it accordingly.  RIVERA: We need a vaccine. That's the only politics that matter right now. We need a vaccine to reassure people. I mean, Japan is going broke, they've got the big Tokyo Olympics coming up.  PERINO: Yes.  RIVERA: Eric and I had a Japanese trip planned for spring break.  WATTERS: Like out of everything that happened, that might be the most tragic.  GUTFELD: Yes. Geraldo's travel plans --  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: I mean, the travel industry is tanking.  COMPAGNO: Yes. Eric and I --  RIVERA: -- people are going to be laid off, people are -- the supply chain of businesses.  WATTERS: But you know, pellets on, if you want to work out by yourself, not a bad call right now.  RIVERA: You're turning your back to me because of fear of contagion or what?  PERINO: Or maybe -- I haven't spoken yet.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: No. I'm trying to pivot to Dana to give her chance to speak.  PERINO: I love the pellets on and I highly recommend it.  There is no evidence for the criticism yet.  WATTERS: Right.  PERINO: Right? So, it's obviously nakedly political. The president said that some Democrats have been reasonable and nice and helpful and one of them was Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois.  WATTERS: Right.  PERINO: Two -- the vice president called lots of people, two of them made comments. One of them through Twitter was Governor Inslee of Washington State. Do you remember he ran for president for a while --  WATTERS: Yes.  PERINO: -- on a climate change thing. He came out on Twitter and said, the vice president called me and I told him, you know, it would be nice if the president cared about science. And it was so wrong.  Dick Durbin said I'm so glad the vice president called me. We're all on this together, let's work on it. That's a difference between somebody who is just being political and somebody who is a real true public servant.  GUTFELD: Just to add, did you see Paul Krugman cheering that the stock market is dropping.  PERINO: Yes.  GUTFELD: Because he wants so badly to be proven right. It doesn't matter if everybody's fortunes are suffering, it's because he's right.  I have a new -- I have a rule this might be stupid. Do you have -- because I don't look at stocks. Do you have to have the stock ticker up all day, because what that does is it just drives people crazy. You can't -- you know, we know it's bad. Put it away.  WATTERS: Yes.  RIVERA: I think it's an age thing also. The older you get the more obsessed do you --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: And Geraldo needs --  GUTFELD: I'm still young.  WATTERS: Geraldo needs to see how much of his fortune is going. All right. Up next --  RIVERA: Who knows, it just be my kids.  WATTERS: -- what's the most important thing you need to know about the coronavirus? Dr. Marc Siegel is here to tell us next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: There have been no deaths in the United States at all. A lot of that is attributable to the fact that we close the border very early, otherwise it could be a different story.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  RIVERA: No deaths in the United States as of yet. No deaths. The president reacting of course to the coronavirus, spreading major fears even panic around the planet. Stock markets getting smashed again today as the total number of cases worldwide tops 84,000, almost 3,000 dead.  Making matters worse, there are conflicting statements over whether the situation is getting better or worse. The CDC director on the one hand is saying the outbreak may not be inevitable here in this country. The World Health Organization though, warning the epidemic could soon reach every country and every corner of our country.  Here to help us sort it all out, Dr. Marc Siegel, our pal. So, welcome. Who is right? The WHO or the CDC? Is it a may not happen here or is it inevitable here?  MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: First of all, the World Health Organization is a bunch of alarmists and they always overstate the problem, they always make it seem like the world is going to end.  RIVERA: Who are they? Who is the World Health -- is that --  SIEGEL: They are part of the United Nations.  RIVERA: Are they part of the U.N.?  SIEGEL: Yes. And as a matter of fact, one of their main people who's in charge of communicable diseases was a Chinese health official for over 20 years. So, he has a certain vested interest and there's a lot of power coming out of China influencing the WHO in my opinion, and they haven't really risen up in this situation as they -- they are useful but I think they've been alarmists.  RIVERA: So, what's the answer to the question?  SIEGEL: So, the CDC, Geraldo, the CDC hasn't been alarmists until suddenly this week. They announced that it's not a matter of if, but when, and they suddenly got alarmists. Here's the answer --  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: Wait, do you think that's why Fauci got taken off the Sunday talk shows?  SIEGEL: Well, I don't --  RIVERA: Anthony Fauci who runs the CDC?  SIEGEL: He's not with the CDC, he's with the NIH.  GUTFELD: FYI.  PERINO: ASAP.  SIEGEL: Geraldo, it was Nancy Messonnier of the CDC who made that comment that it's going to get bad. And here's my answer to your question. And this is what the viewers need to know. We don't know how bad it's going to get, but here's what we do know.  The purpose of public health is to contain and to control it. All this frenzy from our side, from the health side, from the doctor's side, from the official side, health official side is to prevent it from getting bad before the genie gets out of the bottle.  If we get to a situation where we have embers of a fire here, the fire goes out at the end of the year. Emily, you get to the summer and the fire is out, there's no more virus. But if there's embers, it comes back in the fall. And then it can get worse --  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: I think --  COMPAGNO: Doctor -- sorry.  RIVERA: This day my wife is crazy trying to get, trying to get sold out on Amazon. I put this on. I put this on, is this to protect me or to protect you from me?  GUTFELD: It's your mustache, Geraldo.  RIVERA: Will you be serious we're getting --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTGELD: No. Facial hair is an issue.  RIVERA: We have a major crisis --  SIEGEL: You know what he's hiding in that mustache?  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: It's worse than coronavirus.  GUTFELD: No, but it's true.  RIVERA: Can you answer for us?  GUTFELD: It's actually true.  RIVERA: Is it -- is it to protect you from me or me from you?  SIEGEL: Your wife is lovely and I want to inform her right now. Here's the answer. The answer is the mask is only useful if you actually have symptoms. If you have a flu or a cold or a coronavirus and you're coughing or sneezing, the mask prevents those droplets from spreading to other people.  RIVRA: So, it's a public service, a public --  SIEGEL: Yes.  PERINO: But only if you are sick.  SIEGEL: Only if you are sick, if you're not sick --  RIVERA: Yes?  SIEGEL: You're spreading a fear message. I've got a mask. I've got to protect myself against. Why? It's not right next to you. It isn't coming down the street.  RIVERA: Would you wear one?  SIEGEL: And as a matter of fact, if you don't have -- if you don't have the illness and you've got the mask, do you know what happens? You rub the mask, you put something in your eyes, it collects viruses. That's most useful --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Doctor --  PERINO: Can I --  GUTFELD: Mask, yea or nay?  SIEGEL: No, if you are not sick. yes, if you're sick.  GUTFELD: I was just going to ask. One of the things I'm concerned about is when you should go to the E.R. and should you just like -- if you were sick, and I'm not talking about the coronavirus, but if you -- if you break your leg or something -- like what is -- what is -- it's not a good idea to go in the E.R. in the period like this, correct?  SIEGEL: You go to the E.R. if you need to go to the E.R. but you are leading, Greg, to a really important question that I just learned in Nebraska at the quarantine unit. This coronavirus is characterized by a high fever. So if you have a cough and a shortness of breath and a high fever, this is when you want to go to the E.R. But here's what we need. We need the test kits so that I can in the E.R. find out whether you actually have this coronavirus.  PERINO: And who's responsible for getting the test kits and why do we not have enough in the United States?  SIEGEL: Good question. The CDC is responsible for these test kits. They're there. Unfortunately, when they first tried to distribute them, one of the reagents in the kits was off, they had to pull them back. Now they're claiming they're going to be ramping that up over the next couple of weeks. That's the single most important thing because that will also treat the fear, Dana. Somebody comes in, you know, I got a cough, I got a fever. You don't have coronavirus go home.  WATTERS: And we just got some numbers. It says that the new cases in China are kind of going down. A couple of weeks ago there was like 1,500, 2,000 new cases per day, and now there's just a couple hundred. Is that a good sign in China? Do they have the right things under control?  SIEGEL: Well, if you believe that. I don't know how much I believe coming out of China from the beginning to the end. But assuming I believe that, this idea of quarantining a whole region is something out of the Middle Ages. We almost never do it that way. And now they're letting people go back to work there. They could -- they could spread the virus.  WATTERS: It could go back again.  SIEGEL: Yes. So, I'm very dubious.  RIVER: I think learning of the duplicity of the Chinese is one lesson the epidemic has taught us.  COMPAGNO: We've heard all day that a dog now has it. What are the implications for viewers of a species jump and can you relate it to something comparable that we know? Should we be afraid by that or do dogs also get common colds and this is something that happens often?  SIEGEL: You answer your own question. I'm much more concerned about whether it's actually percolating in areas of California or New York and we don't know about it.  RIVERA: In humans.  SIEGEL: In humans. When it comes to animals, this coronavirus started in animals. It started in mammals. It's a mammal virus. So it's not surprising that somebody, you know, that is -- the dog is licking them or they're touching them. If human has coronavirus and passes into a dog, that's a weak case.  RIVERA: That's Greg's dog.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: I'm looking at Jesse's face. He's like, oh.  SIEGEL: Jasper is safe.  PERINO: Jasper is safe, everybody. Fox News alert.  RIVERA: It is interesting -- it is interesting that the deaths have hovered around 2,800. They were escalating, spiking up and up and up, then they kind of --  PERINO: And it's mostly men, right?  SIEGEL: Well, more men, mostly elderly, mostly with chronic health conditions. And this is what they were treating in Nebraska, by the way, and they got better. Old men with --  RIVERA: Mustaches?  SIEGEL: No, no mustaches. If you had pneumonia, they've gotten better. They're actually out of the -- out of the --  GUTFELD: This is the most important information.  SIEGEL: They're getting better. They're getting better.  RIVERA: Tell us about this stuff. What do you want to -- what do you want to do?  SIEGEL: Well, no, I wanted to make the point that, of course, disinfecting this table especially is a really good idea. Because I like the idea of this being an alert. There should be an alert for people. It's not coronavirus that's out there, but by the way, don't sneeze and cough on people. If you're sick, wear a mask.  RIVERA: Don't go to work if you're sick.  SIEGEL: And don't got to work if you're sick. Not because the coronavirus is there --  RIVERA: Don't be selfish.  SIEGEL: Right.  RIVERA: And generally speaking, when you hear -- generally speaking, when you hear politicians talking about this disease, do you think that they are speaking with, you know, kind of credibility or do you discount just when it comes out of their mouth because they're politicians and just looking for their personal benefit?  SIEGEL: It depends on who you're talking about. You talked about Tony Fauci at the NIH, I think he's super. He's one of the top infectious disease experts in the country. Redfield at CDC, also a virologist. We have some people on this panel -- on this expert group that was appointed by the President that actually really belonged to be there.  RIVERA: I really like Mike Bloomberg, but I think what he said about the CDC funding getting cut, and you know, he made some charges that were absolutely untrue. Dr. Marc Siegel --  SIEGEL: One quick thing. I spoke to Cuccinelli the other day from Homeland Security, he said they have plenty of money left over from Ebola. So now the President is asking for 2.5 billion more. That's good.  RIVERA: All right. Ebola, guess who Obama picked as the Ebola czar. A guy named Ron Klain. He used to be the chief of staff of Vice President Gore. We pick -- I mean, Trump picks the Vice President, the sitting Vice President Mike Pence. So you get the vice president from Trump, he gets criticized and Obama picks the Chief of Staff of the Vice President.  Dr. Siegel, thank you very much. Some breaking news to tell you about President Trump tweeting just moments ago. He is nominating Congressman John Ratcliffe to be Director of National Intelligence. More on that when we get it up next on THE FIVE, the ""FASTEST SEVEN.""  GUTFELD: What?  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  COMPAGNO: Welcome back. Time for the ""FASTEST SEVEN."" First up, Hillary Clinton will likely never have president on her resume, but now she can add podcast host. She is planning to launch a new audio show in late spring just in time for the 2020 election. The format and style of the show will reportedly be influenced by Howard Stern. OK, so Greg, supposedly her lineup will be newsmakers.  GUTFELD: Right.  COMPAGNO: If she invited you on, would you say yes?  GUTFELD: Of course. You know -- but having a podcast right now it's like saying you have indoor plumbing. Everybody has -- but I have to say, I love this because now we have a treasure trove of her mad tackles to use for sound bites and sound effects on my show, because she like -- it's just going to be we're going to harvest the sound bites every day. Yes.  PERINO: It'll be interesting to see if she can actually ask questions rather than answer the question as well, right? Like will she -- like one of the great things about Howard Stern is that he asked a question then he -- then he steps back and he lets the interviewer or the interviewee talk. So I don't know. We'll have to see about that.  GUTFELD: Geraldo doesn't know that.  WATTERS: I don't even think her husband is going to listen to this thing. It's going to be a bomb. No one even showed up at her rallies when she was running for president. They had to cancel the tour with her husband and slash ticket prices because she wasn't selling. My mother wouldn't even listen to her.  COMPAGNO: Oh, my God. Geraldo, would you -- would you listen to it?  RIVERA: No, not necessarily, but I never liked listening to the person either. I don't know. Howard Stern is great, and he's really evolved as a radio host. It's not about Howard Stern, I know. But he has become one of the best interviewers on the air.  PERINO: Yes.  RIVERA: And if Hillary wants the model herself after him, she could -- then she couldn't pick a better role model.  COMPAGNO: Good luck, Hillary. OK, next up. People are doing all sorts of crazy things for social media fame, including dangerous stunts like this. Take a look.  PERINO: I hate this.  COMPAGNO: That social media influencer nearly drowned after getting trapped under ice filming a tick tock video. So a question for everyone. Is this just the new version of the former daredevils and adventure people where they die doing things for the thrill or the attention? These selfie deaths, these influencers, is this just the new iteration, or is this a whole new breed of Darwinism?  GUTFELD: Wait, so we're playing it so they actually get rewarded by it. We used to watch Jackass. Jackass was one of the greatest shows ever.  COMPAGNO: Yes.  GUTFELD: So now we have a lot of Jackass.  RIVERA: Why am I not surprised that you like Jackass?  PERINO: I like it too.  GUTFELD: It's one of the great -- one of the great shows of all time.  PERINO: But I think what's really upsetting about this is that he did it to his dog. Like the dog was like panicking and upset that his owner was distressed and the guy didn't even care.  RIVERA: The guy almost died, the distressed?  GUTFELD: That's what you're thinking.  PERINO: I don't care. I am -- I am thinking about the dog 100 percent.  RIVERA: I love it. I love it.  WATTERS: I mean, he's an idiot, but I'm fascinated by it. I think it takes a lot of skill and lung capacity to be able to do what he did. And the friend that filmed it. I liked how the friend didn't say anything and kept it quiet. It made it more dramatic. I mean, these psychos are made for each other.  COMPAGNO: All right, finally, grandma and grandpa are going to pot. There's been a huge spike in the number of senior citizens smoking marijuana and consuming edibles. Geraldo?  RIVERA: And the problem is No, I think that marijuana is a great substance. I think that the creakiness of old age is easily alleviated or mitigated by pot, edibles, or smoking, or vape. I think when you get to be over 65 years old, you should be able to do anything you want to. You know, you live that long and the state should stay out of it.  GUTFELD: But this is so stupid. In 1970, you were 16 if you're 65 now. So these are just the same people, right?  RIVERA: So what's wrong with that?  GUTFELD: I know. That's what I'm saying. That's why it's not a story. It's not that people who are old are smoking pot. It's the same people --  RIVERA: Are still smoking pot.  GUTFELD: Yes.  RIVERA: But only now like, Emily's state, it's legal.  GUTFELD: When you were 21 --  WATTERS: Yes, but Greg, now the pot is so much better.  RIVERA: Yes, that is true.  GUTFELD: Good point.  PERINO: Well, also, the other thing is didn't we just go through a whole thing where we eliminated vaping --  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: Even though we shouldn't have because people that were putting THC oil in the vapes were caused -- those are the ones who were having major trouble.  GUTFELD: Remember that? That epidemic that didn't happen.  RIVERA: But that's not the ones -- it's not like jeweler. They're legit company.  WATTERS: Are you high right now, Geraldo?  RIVERA: I've never been high on television, except when I told people I was about to smoke dope and then smoke dope on T.V. But I've never been high or drunk on television.  WATTERS: We need to pull that clip.  RIVERA: 50 years, never. But it is funny. That clip is funny.  WATTERS: That's a great clip.  COMPAGNO: All right guys, ""FAN MAIL FRIDAY"" is up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: Wow, that was great. ""FAN MAIL FRIDAY."" Let's get to it. What is the most spontaneous thing you've ever done, asks Christina K. Let's go to captain spontaneous herself, Dana.  PERINO: I think it was after meeting Peter on the airplane, I made a last- minute decision six weeks later to meet him in New Orleans.  GUTFELD: Oh, you little -- anyway, Jesse.  WATTERS: One time after work, I just drove straight to the airport and went to Europe without packing.  GUTFELD: Really? That is spontaneous.  WATTERS: I'm kidding. I never did it. It would have been good though.  GUTFELD: I don't -- spontaneity is overrated. I don't do it. You see my notes for the show? You think I'm spontaneous? Geraldo, you've probably have done some pretty freaky stuff.  RIVERA: I was engaged to someone and I got in a car and drove to California and married somebody else.  GUTFELD: Wow. So how did Cherrie take it? Emily?  COMPAGNO: I think all my --  RIVERA: She's my neighbor.  COMPAGNO: -- all my spontaneity is travel based. It would be when I'm already in a different country then we spontaneously decided to travel to another place or do whatnot, so it's not that exciting but --  GUTFELD: I guess when I moved to London, that was spontaneous. But I was unemployed so that's kind of what drives my spontaneity.  WATTERS: Yes.  GUTFELD: All right, this is a good question. What keeps you awake at night, asks LORENXO. Oh, Emily, your eyes just went wide.  COMPAGNO: My own mortality, obviously. That's when I lie in bed freaking out over diseases and when I'm --  GUTFELD: That you're going to die and that everything's going to go -- like that. Oh, Geraldo is starting to get sweaty.  RIVERA: I've got -- I've got a bad foot that hurts and that makes me -- it keeps me awake. And then you start thinking about things like --  GUTFELD: This is getting grim.  RIVERA: And you think about the children and the grandchildren and you worry about --  GUTFELD: That's why I don't have any. Jesse?  WATTERS: Laura Ingraham. You know, it's at 10:00. I'm trying to go to bed. I put it on, and I am like wide awake. It's so entertaining.  RIVERA: I thought you didn't watch Fox.  GUTFELD: I love how Jesse can turn that. Dana, what keeps you up at night?  PERINO: Ambulances.  WATTERS: Oh, that is annoying.  PERINO: And they've got a new sound over there at the hospital near us.  RIVERA: Yes, at Roseville.  PERINO: It's like -- it's like a British or European one and it drives me insane.  GUTFELD: How dare those injured people disrupt your sleep?  PERINO: They don't need to have it that loud.  GUTFELD: You what I realized? Everything that keeps me up at night, I never think about it the next day. Isn't that weird?  PERINO: It's true.  GUTFELD: I like lying back and I go oh my god, oh my god, and then I get up but I totally forgot about it. Which means whatever I'm thinking about in the middle of the night is totally worthless.  WATTERS: You just talked as fast as Emily right there.  COMPAGNO: Almost.  RIVERA: And you know, sometimes they just run those sirens to beat the traffic.  PERINO: Yes.  GUTFELD: Oh my god.  RIVERA: They have nobody in the ambulance.  GUTFELD: What makes you -- here's the next question. What makes You feel the age you are now? Jesse, you're almost 50.  WATTERS: I am getting aches and pains.  GUTFELD: Yes?  WATTERS: Yes, in my shoulders, in my elbow, in my -- in my shoulders and elbow mostly, yes. A lot of aches and pains. I should take an edible.  RIVERA: I just asked for the restaurant within limping distance.  GUTFELD: Emily? That is a request is a rude question to ask women though? You can't ask women feeling your rage.  COMPAGNO: Yes -- no, it's OK. Feeling like little things make me hurt like just breathing wrong. I'm like, oh, my back went out. But also, my total hatred of younger people and millennials and whatever generation is below them where I'm like, you've got like such inexperience and immaturity and I can't believe that, you know, then I like I really am at 80.  PERINO: I think what makes me feel old is in the pod upstairs, like --  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: Well, I said I was -- I got to see Dionne Warwick, at the Ryman in Nashville, and none of those young people have heard of Dionne Warwick.  GUTFELD: Yes, yes, and that's the thing. Because remember, she did the psychic network. Isn't that who she is?  PERINO: No.  GUTFELD: I know. I'm kidding. No, but she did. But she's -- yes, she did. Remember later in life? No, it's true that when you talk about music and people -- or movies, when you say oh, you've got to see this movie Blue Velvet, and there's a kid who was born in like 1997 just looks at you like --  PERINO: My assistant --  GUTFELD: Is that with Clark Gable?  PERINO: Hamdah did not know who -- what Abba was.  GUTFELD: Oh my god.  WATTERS: Abba?  GUTFELD: Yes.  WATTERS: I don't who's Dick Van Dyke was.  COMPAGNO: Jesse --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: I have no idea.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: All right, ""ONE MORE THING"" is up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PERINO: Time now for ""ONE MORE THING."" I want to celebrate someone's life. Harold Burson passed away recently. He was 98 years old. He was an incredible American. You should know about him. He was born in Memphis, Tennessee in 1921. He graduated high school at just 15 years old. He went into the Army and he was a reporter that cover the Nuremberg Trials for the American Forces Network.  And then when he got back, he launched a P.R. company. And in 1999, he was described as the century's most influential P.R. figure. Many of you will remember the Johnson and Johnson, Tylenol -- what was it -- what was in there?  GUTFELD: Was it spike?  PERINO: It was spike but --  RIVERA: Cyanide.  PERINO: Cyanide, yes. And he was the person that helped Johnson and Johnson through that reputational crisis communications situation. And then I had a chance to work with him right after I left the White House and he was a really one of -- one of a kind individual, a wonderful person, lived to be 98 years old and his life was celebrated today up at Lincoln Center.  RIVERA: How nice for him that you did that.  PERINO: Yes, he's -- he was a wonderful man. Geraldo?  RIVERA: It was the middle school science fair and my beautiful 14-year-old Sol Liliana Rivera. That bear is not just the bear, it's actually it's Harley, the Heat Conscious Bear and it has sensors in it. So when a child is outside and it gets too hot, the bear has a sensor, the LED lights start flashing and the kid knows the little child knows to go inside, that it's - - that they're overheating and it's dangerous. So my beautiful daughter Sol invented this wonderful --  COMPAGNO: That's so neat. That's amazing.  GUTFELD: She should have named him Bret, not Harley.  RIVERA: She named him Harley, the Heat Conscious Bear.  PERINO: Good for her. Greg, you're next.  GUTFELD: All right, tomorrow night, we're still having a brand new show Saturday 10:00 p.m. We got Ed Henry. We got Kristen Soltis Anderson, Kat Timpf, and Tyrus. That's 10:00 p.m. tomorrow. You better watch it. Let's do this quickly, shall we? Greg, What does the sloth say? Good question, Greg. I've never heard a baby sloth speak. Listen to the baby sloth. What does it say? Isn't that interesting? Look at that.  PERINO: Looks like a cat.  WATTERS: Did you dub that?  GUTFELD: No. That is not -- that is not dubbed. Isn't that one of the most amazing things?  PERINO: I think he's saying faster, faster.  COMPAGNO: So adorable.  GUTFELD: That's what they always say. You can't go fast, Sloth. All right - -  RIVERA: Give him some edibles.  PERINO: Oh my gosh. Jesse, you're next.  WATTERS: I don't know if I can top that. This is some crazy Australian. He's a BMX idiot. And look what he does with his little recliner. That's a sport. And he lands it. He lands it.  COMPAGNO: Oh my god.  WATTERS: There he is. That's Jed Mildon. They call him a BMX athlete.  PERINO: I love Australians.  WATTERS: Yes. Just looking for --  GUTFELD: Yes, and they happen to own this company.  PERINO: That's true. That is true.  GUTFELD: I love them too.  WATTERS: Yes, they're the best.  PERINO: Australians are amazing people.  WATTERS: If I wasn't an American, I'd be in Australian.  PERINO: Yes, I mean, I think I'm an honorary Australian.  WATTERS: Yes, I feel that way.  PERINO: OK. All right, Emily, your next.  COMPAGNO: OK, you guys, tomorrow night, I'm so excited. I'm hosting Fox Nation South Carolina Primary coverage live at 8:00 p.m. I hope you'll join me and my all-star political panel as we break down the results as they come in. Go to FoxNation.com to join the fun. It's also free on Facebook, so accessible to all.  So if you're not a member of Fox Nation, you can still view it though. You should be and I definitely hope that you join Fox Nation. And before I go, take a look at this amazing pup showing out on the basketball court. This was at a Warriors-Lakers game. The Chihuahuas stole the show when he walked on his hind legs and dunked. Go, Warriors.  RIVERA: Go Warriors? Bad year for the Warriors.  GUTFELD: I don't know. I don't like dogs that do tricks.  COMPAGNO: Look at him.  PERINO: He's pretty good.  COMPAGNO: Look how gently he put it in.  GUTFELD: Yes, but how many --  PERINO: Why do you not like dogs do tricks? Why?  GUTFELD: Because that meant that like hours and hours that dog was forced to do that in order to do that?  PERINO: Do you know that -- but you know what, he got treats for doing it.  GUTFELD: I think it's torture.  COMPAGNO: So treats for the dog.  WATTERS: What do you care about the dog? He entertains.  GUTFELD: No, because I do -- I empathize, Jesse.  WATTERS: You do not empathize.  RIVERA: You empathize (INAUDIBLE) in your butt.  WATTERS: Yes, you ask a doctor if it was OK to go to the E.R. if you broke your leg during a pandemic?  GUTFELD: Yes, I'd say home.  COMPAGNO: Well, you were actually --  WATTERS: If you're worried about getting injuries during a pandemic --  GUTFELD: You should -- you should not expose yourself in an E.R.  PERINO: No, he's worried -- yes, he's worried about going to the E.R. to get the coronavirus.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: I totally understood where he was coming from. That's it for us, everybody.

63,FOX,"Media melts down over Trump's coronavirus presser. So let’s review the media reaction to President Trump’s coronavirus presser. CNN’s ball of hysteria, Brian Stelter, tweeted: ""Since the dawn of the Trump era, countless experts have warned that the president's lack of credibility would imperil the country in the event of an emergency. As the coronavirus outbreak worsens, those fears may be coming true."" That one tweet defines the media's dark desires for something bad to happen so that all of their previous hate for Trump is validated. NEW YORK TIMES RIPPED FOR COLUMN SAYING CORONAVIRUS SHOULD BE CALLED 'TRUMPVIRUS' ""The fears may be coming true,"" Brian wish-tweets, relying on the word all CNN's false fantasies bank on: ""may."" Every story that collapses hinges on ""may."" Trump may resign. Trump may not leave office. Michael Avenatti may run for president! CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER It’s a word that provides cover for the media’s delusional dreams. Today, that dream is a disease. This time people will surely die! But it will be Trump’s fault, and then finally I’ll be right and CNN President Jeff Zucker will give me a lollipop! It’s a diabolical deal, welcoming a grim hell just to say, ""I told you so."" Meanwhile, Gail Collins wrote in The New York Times that we should call the disease “Trumpvirus.” I say, let's rename ""dementia"" and call it ""The New York Times."" Because only a truly mindless paper would still run Gail's laughable drivel. It's an example of how they'd rather politicize than actually help. Members of the press claim to champion credibility, but their own credibility is a joke. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Times and CNN can’t be trusted on any topic, because their deranged filter spits out the same answer on everything. “Orange man bad!” I would call it a “plague,” otherwise known as “Gail Collins Disease.” Adapted from Greg Gutfeld’s monologue on “The Five” on Feb. 27, 2020.

64,FOX,"Trump campaign sues over 2019 op-ed; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" February 27, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: There are laws against that with gas stations and others that do the same during hurricanes or natural disaster events. But, man, oh, man, with everything that's going on, forget about losing your shirt in the market. You should lose a lot more when you pull that stunt in the middle of a crisis.  Here comes The Five.  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Juan Williams along with Emily Compagno, Jesse Watters, Dana Perino, and Gregory Gutfeld. It is 5:00 in New York City, and this is The Five. A big political battle in Washington over the Coronavirus, President Trump, trying to reassure Americans, meanwhile, top Democrats are criticizing his administration's response.  We'll get to that later. But first, some 2020 politic, new reporting indicates the Democratic Party is worried over Bernie Sanders' surge. According to the New York Times, a good portion of Democratic super delegates do not want to hand Senator Sanders the nomination if he falls short of a majority of delegates before the convention.  And after saying she rejects socialism, Speaker Nancy Pelosi now says she will back Sanders if he becomes her party's presidential nominee.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): Unity, unity, unity. Whoever I nominate is -- we will support with respect for his or her positions, and hopefully with their respect for our positions as well. So we have made a decision to win. And as I say to the members, if you make a decision to win, you have to make every subsequent decision to win. No friction, no nothing. Just stay on the path to victory.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: And Bernie Sanders has been causing controversy with comments about Cuba. But as you know, he is finding some support in the media.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They accused Dr. King of being a communist. Every major leader in the 60s, they tried to call a socialist a communist.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You have folks who are so afraid of Bernie Sanders, so afraid of Elizabeth Warren, so afraid of the progressives, and they are willing to say that if the Democratic Party nominates a progressive, and what they are saying to me in that moment is that they are more comfortable with the white nationalists in the White House.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: Jesse, you know, this is so interesting. It looks like there is resistance on the Democratic Party side. But on the Republican Party side, it looks like they are salivating to run against Sanders and the claim of socialist.  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, one of those reasons, Juan, is just in an hour on Wednesday, Bernie called our strongest mid-east ally a racist. He said that Castro was a great guy, even though he had Russian missiles pointed at our country, and says he wants to give taxpayer money to black Americans so they can grow and sell weed. That was just in one hour, Juan.  That's why people are nervous on the Democratic side. His coalition -- in terms of the Electoral College is not as strong as he believes. If you think are seniors going to turn out for Bernie Sanders? Are suburban women going to turn out? Is he going to get black turnout in Charlotte, in Philadelphia, in Detroit? We'll see about that.  He wants to ban fracking. Is that going to help him in Pennsylvania? Are his Castro comments going to help him in Miami-Dade? Are union voters in Michigan, who have great healthcare plans going to vote for a guy who says you can't keep that plan? I don't know. I don't think he is positioned perfectly, well, not perfect. Donald Trump, when he was running, won 41 out of the 50 early contests.  I don't think Bernie is going to hit 41. He is going to lose in South Carolina. And he's down by 20 points to Biden in Florida. Those are key contests. The rest of the Democratic voters, they have major differences with the core issues that Bernie supports. They are not behind the Green New Deal. They are not behind Medicare for all.  They are not behind free college. And they are not behind raising taxes on middle-class Americans to pay for it.  WILLIAMS: But wait a second. Are you a Democrat now? It sounds like you are a super delegate.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: I'm super.  (CROSSTALK)  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: He is not at all delicate.  WILLIAMS: So Dana, let's come to this point, though. So Pelosi says unity, unity, unity. If this is the nominee, I will back him, even though there is open, open anxiety among Democrats about the impact Sanders might have down ballot.  PERINO: But what do Democrats really want? What does any political party really want? And the Democrats really want to get back into power. So if Bernie Sanders is their only ride out of town, you're going to buy the ticket and you will get on board and you'll help. But I don't think -- the story is not over yet. And one of the things that the media loves to write is anything that shows a pivot or a comeback.  And if Joe Biden all of a sudden does well in South Carolina and winning looks good on him and then on Tuesday, it's a mixed bag where you have Bernie win some, Sanders wins some, maybe Pete Buttigieg wins a couple. I don't see anyone else winning other states. Maybe Klobuchar wins her home state in Minnesota. Then the media is going to write this story that will help get this contest into another place, which what we've been talking about this possibility of a contested convention.  Watch very carefully what all of these candidates are saying. There is a question with the Democrats at their convention. Do you think you need to have a majority to win or a plurality to win? Because right now, it looks like none of these candidates are going to get to the convention with a majority plus one. So then the question is, well, Bernie Sanders says I should get it because I'm in the lead.  But everybody else is, like, that's not the rule. You go to a second ballot, and in that case, I don't think Bernie Sanders --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: By the way, I hope you saw that Elizabeth Warren really took him down yesterday on this idea. Because the last time around, in 2016, he said that nobody should be given the nomination if they don't have a majority of the delegates at the start of the --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: -- one other thing. I talked to a Democrat today who works on House and Senate races for Democrats. And I said on a scale of 1 to 10, how concerned are you about the effects of a Bernie Sanders candidacy as the nominee on those races that you're working on? And he said we are at an 11.  WILLIAMS: Yeah. OK, so, Greg, you and I have had these discussions about parallels between Trump and Sanders.  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Absolutely.  WILLIAMS: But now, so, you know, CPAC is starting their convention. Their theme is America versus socialism. I think that they think that Sanders is going to be easy pickings for Donald Trump. What do you think?  GUTFELD: I wouldn't be so sure. OK, the Democratic Party right now is the guy who wakes the morning after his bachelor party in Vegas, realizing he just married the bearded lady from the circus. You know, they are handcuffed in the hotel room to Bernie Sanders, and they realize he's got a lot of kinks, right? So -- and the convention is like that quick and dirty annulment you do before anybody finds out.  But I think people -- this is the period of reckoning for everyone who laughed at the Republicans in 2016. What the Democrats are feeling right now is what the Republicans felt almost to a T about Trump. First, you saw that it was a just a joke or a novelty. Then you realize it's more than a novelty as there is some kind of connection going on.  Then, there's a sense of panic, that it's more than a connection. And as people drop out, the plurality just kind of grows and that the argument about him not having all the other people doesn't make sense, because all the other candidates aren't running together. So that thing goes away. And then, you have this resignation. But there was a difference.  Trump then won. That's the difference. And the thing is what's missing is the belief that Trump will win. But then, that was missing before. And the one good thing about Sanders is its getting people to think about socialism, right? That why is socialism popular among the young, because it offers free stuff? And then people start realizing that it's not really free.  It's a pretty good education, and you dig further into what his compliments about Cuba. You find it's actually re-education, literacy program in which they force you to digest communist propaganda and turning your parents. People start to learn these things. So I think it's helpful. And what if he wins? What if he wins?  WILLIAMS: Yeah, he could win.  WATTERS: Everyday will be like today on the stock market.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: You lost money.  (CROSSTALK)  EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS HOST: -- super delegates actually --  (CROSSTALK)  COMPAGNO: -- the plurality versus the majority. I think that what matters is whether in fact they make a difference in this nomination. So if they are truly responsible, those 93, for sinking his nomination, then A, we are going to see that the factions between the Democrat -- it's going to be unlike anything we've ever seen.  And at a minimum, it's going to depress voter turnout. That will 100 percent cement Trump's win. Not really like they needed any more reason, because there is no way that a large amount of those voters are going to turn out after that. They're going to blame it for everything. And it's the kind of thing that gives rise to third parties.  And even though it doesn't seem very plausible, it's 100 percent possible with the amount of anger and the amount of rage that would come out of the Bernie bros and that socialist aspect of the party. And then if they just kind of symbolically go against him and it's not enough to sink him, then after that, his entire campaign will have to divert their resources to patching up the party in addition to winning the general. And that's going to be a big amount of haemorrhaging and they are still going to be --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: But just to pick up on what Greg said, when Trump won, everybody says, oh, some of these, you know, moderate Republicans aren't going to support. They did. Everybody lined up. Everybody got behind Trump.  GUTFELD: Because he was a great president.  WILLIAMS: Thank you. Thank you. One other point, on Saturday and Sunday, guess where Bernie Sanders was going to be? Not Texas, but Massachusetts. I think he wants to knock Warren out.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: And they have a very good campaign.  COMPAGNO: And to your final point, that's why Pelosi is softening her rhetoric, because she is already taking those steps to be, like, well, I'm either going to have to defend this or sort of tiptoe around it if he's the nominee. So eventually, they will all likely get in line.  WILLIAMS: Good point. Thanks, Em. Coming up, our reaction to President Trump's Coronavirus news conference, plus, Gregory's monologue, yes, he's next on how the media is reacting to that story. Stay with us on The Five.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: So let's review the media's reaction to the Trump Coronavirus presser.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The sheer volume of things that are not true that have been said by the president and by some of his aides does not inspire credibility.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Trump administration's war on science has left us vulnerable.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I found most of what he said a little incoherent.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's surprised that 25,000 to 69,000 people each year die to the flu. That just tells you how little he actually knows about public health. He just revealed how ignorant he is about the situation.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: And then there's CNN's ball of hysteria. Brian Stelter tweeting this, since the dawn of the Trump era, countless experts have warned that the president's lack of credibility would imperil the country in the event of an emergency. As the Coronavirus outbreak worsens, those fears maybe coming true. That one tweet defines the media's dark desires for something bad to happen so that all of their previous Trump hatred is validated.  The fears maybe coming true, Brian wish tweets, relying on the word all CNN's false fantasies bank on may. Every story that collapses hinges on may. Trump may resign. Trump may not leave office. Avenatti may run for president, Brian. It's a word that provides cover for the press' delusional dreams. And today, that dream is a disease.  This time, people will surely die, but it will be Trump's fault. And then finally, I will be right and Jeff Zucker will give me a lollipop. It's a diabolical deal, welcoming a grim hell just to say I told you so. Meanwhile, Gail Collins in the New York Times says let's call the disease the Trump virus, to which I say let's rename dementia the New York Times.  Because only a truly mindless paper would still run Gail's laughable drivel, an example of how they rather politicize than help. So as these jackasses claim to champion credibility, their own credibility is a joke. CNN, The Times, can't be trusted on any topic, because their deranged filter spits out the same answer on everything.  Orange man bad, I would call it a plague, otherwise known as Gail Collins' disease. Nobody knows anything, Dana.  PERINO: Nope.  GUTFELD: So let's politicize it.  PERINO: Yeah. One thing I did admire, Ro Khanna, the congressman from California, who is the poster (ph) of the Bernie Sanders campaign. He has refused to do that, even though Bernie Sanders obviously really would love to take on Donald Trump in the election. The correct answer is humanity is in a race against these biological changes.  Mother Nature is, like, oh, you know what? I'm going to tweak this little virus. And those people who work in public health, thank goodness for them. They spend 24/7 racing against this virus. And if you look back in history, we've known that this was going to happen again. That's why you have public health. That's why you have doctors who are dedicated primarily to dealing with flu's and the Coronaviruses like this.  I thought last night that the reporters in the briefing room were actually really respectful, smart, responsible, asked good questions. It's when you get into the commentary side of things that things get off the rail.  GUTFELD: Yeah. You know, Emily, one of the people in the montage was Ezekiel, was bashing Trump, because he did -- he was surprised how many people died from the flu every year. Everybody is surprised by how many people die of the flu, because everybody is so used to it. Does that mean that Trump is some kind of idiot that lacks credibility?  COMPAGNO: Well, not to me. And I think, you know, first of all, the president is damned if he does and damned if he doesn't. So no matter what he says, everyone in the commentary is going to have that ridiculous reaction. And I think in things that actually matter, which is this public health and actually, you know, a threat of an actual fatality, then exasperation leads to zero tolerance.  So when the Russia, Russia, Russia, and everything in the last three years that we've been fed by CNN and MSNBC and everything else in those commentators, you know, here we go again. Yes, everything is his fault. But when it's something like this where actually the public needs true, reliant information, no one is going to watch that.  And by the way, when I went to Walgreens earlier to stock up on antiseptic hand gel and everything, it was all gone from the shelves. Everything, including temperature takers, what are those called?  GUTFELD: Thermometers?  COMPAGNO: Thermometers. And now -- by the way, don't forget. SARS which was -- is a Coronavirus more deadly than covid-19 was reduced to 30 to 15 percent entrance simply by hand washing. So there are little things like that as usual, we have people who are putting their own hatred of the president over disseminating simple actual facts that will help all of us. So I just washed my hands like homicide style now, like, up to the elbows.  GUTFELD: Yeah, like, Alan Alda in MASH when they would just sit there for 10 minutes and do a scene. What bothers me, Juan, is that somebody like Gail Collins has no interest. OK, I should put it in a positive way. When people come here on The Five, and we actually have -- offer solutions and we are talking about it.  But it seems like on the other side, the Trump haters, they don't have solutions. They just want to politicize, Gail Collins, Stelter. We actually sit here and talk about stuff, like, travel restrictions and hygiene and things like that. I think we're the good people in this and they are evil, Juan.  WILLIAMS: Well, I think we are the good people.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: I do worry when you don't say, hey, wait a second. There is real news there when you see the president contradict the woman at the Center for Disease Control. She says it's not a matter of if but when. The president comes back and says very low probability. One person say even though we know there are, like, many more, dozens more sick.  And so then I think, there's a real argument here you can say is being politicized. But I would say the president, in terms of his own argument, has made a very political because he comes at it with calm down. I'm going to reassure you. No reason for any -- I like that. I like the president acting in that way because I think that's presidential.  But on the other hand, I want to hear the facts. And the other part of it is I'd say is this president does have a credibility issue. This is the guy everybody makes fun of that map with the hurricane, but he's the guy who said the inauguration attendance is so great.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Biggest economy in the world and it's highly effective. I would say that both things, whatever the CDC said are directionally true. They can both be true.  WATTERS: But I think the media has the worst credibility problem than the president. The American people trust the president more than they trust the media. The president was saying when the CDC person said it's inevitable that it's going to get larger. The president said nothing is inevitable. It could get larger. It could get smaller. We just don't know.  The guy is a germaphobe who is tough on China and is a border hawk. He is the perfect president to take on this virus. And -- early travel restriction bought us time as now everybody acknowledges. Yet, he was called a racist for doing it. Now, the containment strategy so far is working. Not one single American has died in the United States.  And according to Johns Hopkins University, America is the best prepared country in the entire world for this. Doctors and administrators have been mobilized. And I'm very, very happy with the fact that in a new year, we are going to have a vaccine. And in a couple months, you're going to have a therapeutic drug. Now, I think we are on the frontlines.  We are the ones who have to wash our hands. We are the ones who have to cough like this, not go to China and make preparations. The federal government can only do so much. And it's the hospitals and the administrators and the nurses and the localities, not Washington, D.C. They are the ones that are going to have to handle this. And so far, they are doing a really, really good job.  WILLIAMS: I agree with you. The deep state is doing a great job.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: I didn't say that, Juan. I didn't say that. I just want to know what the Democrat plan --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: Because I don't know what it is? Is it open borders? Is it turn the healthcare system upside down?  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: If I hear a good idea from them, then we can --  GUTFELD: All right. That was constructive. CNN, they blame people. We are trying to come up with answers because we want to help you, America. All right, the Trump campaign fighting back against the Russia collusion smear with a lawsuit against the New York Times, more to come on The Five.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WATTERS: President Trump's campaign fighting back hard against the Russia collusion smear by suing the New York Times for libel, and claiming the liberal paper is trying to influence the outcome of the 2020 election. The lawsuit is over an op-ed that claimed there was an overarching deal between then candidate Trump and Russia to help him win the 2016 election. Here's the president reacting.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: When they got the opinion totally wrong as the New York Times did. And frankly, they've got a lot wrong over the last number of years. So let that work its way through the courts. It's beyond opinion. That's not an opinion. That's something much more than an opinion. They did a bad thing and there will be more coming.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: So Emily, this is after Mueller found no collusion. This is after the New York Times reported there was no collusion. So the New York Times runs a column that says there is basically collusion. There's a conspiracy. There's a deal. Is that libellous if they know it is wrong and do it anyway?  COMPAGNO: Right. Well, we will see in that lawsuit and its outcome. And certainly, that's what the president thinks. I think if I were him in that moment, here's how I would've said it, though. It's basically the basis for that lawsuit. I would have said, look, they are claiming it's merely an opinion piece.  But that being said, if you have a malicious intent and you disregard truth and diligence and you publish it anyway, and you know it to be false --  WATTERS: And you know it is going to hurt their reputation.  COMPAGNO: And it did, in fact, cause damage, because you have to prove actual damages. It did, in fact, cause damage to my campaign. And that is why we are suing. That is why we are suing. So that's what I would have said in that moment. But I think the issue here will be whether, in fact, there were impactable damages.  At this point however, it's simply an echo chamber. So go ahead. Keep publishing whatever you want. Obviously, it's from 2019. But I think more importantly, it's the statement this makes, which is the president saying I'm sick of this. And guess what, I have endless bankroll for this, so you guys can use your bank to try to defend it.  WATTERS: Why do you think The Times will run a fake column like that, Juan?  WILLIAMS: I don't know. It's like you and I have opinions on many issues. I don't say that your opinion is fake. I just say it's an opinion, Jesse. And I think this is an opinion. This is a frivolous lawsuit. I mean, it's intended to intimidate the press and intimidate people. And maybe it's red meat for the base. But I think it's really low grade red meat.  WATTERS: Can an opinion be wrong if the facts are wrong?  WILLIAMS: Look, if their facts are wrong --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Again, the New York Times -- this is not a news article. This is an opinion piece. You know what I'm reminded of? At the moment, there is great pressure on the Wall Street Journal because they ran an opinion piece that the Chinese government didn't like, and they threw the Chinese -- The Wall Street Journal reporters out of the country. This is an intimidation tactic. Wall Street Journal shouldn't back down. And I don't think the New York Times --  WATTERS: I don't think the President is going to toss the Times reporter out of the country.  WILLIAMS: Well, what is he --  WATTERS: He's just making him burn money on lawyer fees.  PERINO: Well, it helps him because can -- he wants to push back. He wants to punch back. So they're like, OK, well, we could try this. And you might not win in court, but you know what, we can try it and then he gets a lot of publicity about it. Now, we're talking about it again.  But here's the other thing. I think it also helps the New York Times. Their subscriptions have gone up and up and up. Everybody in media has been doing better during a Trump presidency. So now they get to close ranks and let all their subscribers --  WATTERS: Do you think they'll think twice about running false stuff?  PERINO: No, I do not.  WATTERS: No.  PERINO: Well, I also -- I think that they'll find a way to protect their opinion writers.  WATTERS: OK. Greg?  GUTFELD: The problem is though, their opinion writers also report. I mean, I find their opinions on the front page.  WATTERS: Yes.  GUTFELD: You know what I mean? It's --  PERINO: Yes. I mean, they can say that this one was on the comment, but I agree.  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: When a news reporter writes analysis on the front page, how he supposed to see the difference.  GUTFELD: Yes. And, you know, I don't want to be sued when I'm wrong. But then again -- but generally, I always admit that I'm wrong. Like I --  WATTERS: You do?  GUTFELD: Oh, I admit that I'm wrong on everything. It actually really feels good. And maybe if these people admit they're wrong, he dropped the suit. However, what sparked this whole thing is probably the biggest story in the media world, which was the Covington case. I mean, the Covington case encapsulated all of the very bad elements of media instincts and bias.  You know, this the Covington story began with that guy looks bad, that other guy looks good. This story gets me emotionally excited. And my story might catch fire on social media. So that was what -- that's what how that story rolled, and it resulted in a lawsuit that they had to settle. And I think that has changed the way people look at the media that they can fight back.  WILLIAMS: But I might say, isn't it ironic that Republicans who are normally opposed to this kind of frivolous lawsuit, you know, digging up lawsuits on people. Now, oh, yes, go right at it, Mr. Trump.  WATTERS: I think people don't think it's frivolous, Juan. Coming up, is Sleepy Joe Biden's last chance to stop a socialist takeover of the Democratic Party? But is it too late? That's next on THE FIVE.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PERINO: So this Saturday in South Carolina, it could be Joe Biden's last stand. The former V.P. leading in the polls heading into voting in that state. But will it be enough to stop Bernie Sanders in the end? Here's Biden earlier.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you were not the nominee, what does that then say about the Democratic Party?  JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It says to me that we have moved away from our roots, our basic rationale for being existence as a party. I think that what's at stake here is this notion that somehow -- like, for example, a revolution, people are looking for results and looking to get things done. They're looking to build on what Brock and I did in our administration.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: Have Biden and other Democrats already lost the battle for the soul of the party? Well, a new poll finds three in four democrats saying that they would vote for a socialist. So Bernie Sanders won, is he winning hearts and minds out there and the Democratic Party?  WILLIAMS: Look at those results in the elections, Dana. Clearly, people think that Bernie has something to offer. And you know, there was an interesting op-ed today, I guess it might result in a suit, in the New York Times, in which the argument was made that so many Democrats, especially younger voters, really say hey, you Democratic moderates, you have failed us.  You just let the Republicans come hard and come tough, and they went all the fights, even though they don't have most of the votes in the country. They run over, they elect Trump president and you guys are always like trying to be rational and reasonable and get things done and have a conversation.  WATTERS: Democrats are being rational?  WILLIAMS: I think -- I think so. But I mean, the other part of this is that I think the socialist tag for Bernie is, hey, you're going to help me with my medical bills, you're going to help me with my kids get into school, and people like that. They don't see it as a socialist --  PERINO: They want a wholesale change.  WILLIAMS: They do.  PERINO: Like Bernie's people, Jesse, they want the whole kit and caboodle thrown out and start something new because they think that the system hasn't worked for them.  WATTERS: Well, for many years, it hasn't. But it's beginning to work again for regular Americans. And if you're voting to just get free stuff, it's a shortcut you have to work for it. You see young Americans every day trying to apply for jobs. And you know, they're there for two weeks and they say, oh, well, can I have a raise? Oh, can I have a title change? It's not how it works. And I think that's where a lot of Democrats feel right now.  PERINO: They think this is --  WATTERS: They think you can become Jesse Watters overnight.  GUTFELD: No.  WATTERS: It takes a long time, people.  GUTFELD: Years.  PERINO: I heard Democrats today on a podcast, Greg, talking about how -- they think that Democrats will ultimately coalesce behind Bernie if he's the nominee, because the truth is, nobody has to worry that he'll actually be able to accomplish anything that he wants to get accomplished because the Congress will stop him. I'm like, that's not a very good message.  GUTFELD: Well, you know what, there is a truth to the limited power of the executive branch. Don't I sound good when I say that? But it is. It's like you're in a box. And what can Sanders do if you have a Republican House and a Republican Senate? He can introduce idiotic ideas that, you know, that people could just laugh at and he could just sit there for like, a couple of four years and then they get rid of them.  But it's like, the thing is, the reason why so many people are interested in socialism is they see it as a buffet. It's like they don't have to take that, you know, the means of production, they just want a tax. They don't understand that the taxing actually affects the means of production and kind of screws up all the thing.  What I want to see is I want to see somebody asked Bernie Sanders how you reconcile government-run health care and child care and forgiveness of loans with open borders? Because that is incompatible. A really good socialist who believes in government-run everything wants a closed system. You have to -- yes, you have to have a closed system because if you have -- you can't have both. That's why the libertarian likes open borders, because once you get here, you got to fend for yourself.  PERINO: You got to work.  GUTFELD: You got to work. The socialist is exactly the opposite. How do they -- how is he going to reconcile that? Somebody has got to ask him that question. My feeling is -- and Juan, I bet you agree. If he gets elected, he won't change much of anything that Trump is doing. He'll be for the trade wars. He'll be for the wall. He'll be for -- you know what I'm saying?  WILLIAMS: Wait, wait, wait. I don't think he's for open borders, by the way. But let's say he's for more open, he's not for building the wall is your point?  GUTFELD: He loves the wall.  PERINO: He thinks that in his heart.  WILLIAMS: But I say --  PERINO: I don't know what's in his heart. He had a heart attack.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: Then I'll ask you. What happens if Biden does win in South Carolina and does OK and Super Tuesday, and then -- and then what?  COMPAGNO: Here -- OK, if Biden wins in South Carolina, then what's going to happen is we go into Super Tuesday with the media narrative that it's Bernie versus Biden. But the reality is that Bernie has one every state going into it, and likely he will also get the delegate-rich states coming out of Super Tuesday. Because guess what, there's a lot of early voting happening on happening, right?  You've seen it in Texas, in Virginia, in North Carolina, so he has a lot of momentum. And what Biden's camp better hope for is that if Biden wins South Carolina, that the never Bernie's and the centrist Dems really rally around him, and they eat into the margins that up until now Bernie has in those states.  PERINO: What I want to know is when are people like Kamala Harris, and Cory Booker, and others that have dropped out Michael Bennet, like where are they? Why don't they get behind one of these candidates?  GUTFELD: Kamala is going to be Biden's V.P.  PERINO: Well, then she should endorse him tomorrow.  GUTFELD: And then who's going to be Sanders' V.P., Liz or Kamala?  PERINO: I don't think so. Nope, I don't think it's any of those people. I don't know, but I don't think it's anybody that we --  GUTFELD: Pat Paulsen?  PERINO: Who?  COMPAGNO: Maybe he'll take Yang from Bloomberg.  PERINO: I don't know. I don't know what Greg just said but he's going to tell me in the break. Coming up, Saturday Night Live comedian Pete Davidson now backtracking on his apology for mocking Congressman Dan Crenshaw's war injury, plus some outrageous new comments from Jussie Smollett.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  COMPAGNO: OK. Two controversial celebrities making some new ridiculous comments. First, there's SNL is Pete Davidson. He's taking back its 2018 apology for mocking Congressman Dan Crenshaw who lost an eye serving in Afghanistan. Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  PETE DAVIDSON, COMEDIAN: So I meet one of these guys with an eyepatch. And then like I kind of got forced to apologize because like, people were like threatening to like to shoot me in the face. The only thing I did do, which I am guilty of and I apologize for is I did make that guy famous and a household name for no reason.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: Wow. What I jerk.  COMPAGNO: This just reminds me that this 26-year-old is a child. So, we have 17-year-olds who are deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan and they are men. And this is a boy who dyes his hair green and gets to sit courtside at the mix or wherever with some hot celebrity that's eight times him in the stratosphere of irrelevance, and he gets to say that on stage.  I think he is an absolute waste of flesh. And for someone who has said that he advocates for mental health awareness, I think he's doing a pretty piss poor job of being a good in any way, model in any of that for others. That's how I feel. I feel real strongly about it.  GUTFELD: I like how you restrained yourself. I can see you stopping before you were going to -- you know, the thing is, he tried to make it a bad a joke about himself and said that I made Crenshaw star the way Ariana Grande made me star.  The only difference is Davidson couldn't hold Dan's eyepatch, you know. But he -- I think he knows that and I always -- I always feel bad for the parents of the women he's dating because he's such a wreck. And he pours all of that emotional pain onto that poor girl and the parents are freaking out half the time. Not that I would know anything about it.  COMPAGNO: Dana, what do you think about this?  PERINO: Well, I really admire Dan Crenshaw. I don't really admire Pete Davidson, though I feel for him because of the things he's gone through. And I hope that he finds somewhere in his heart to be a more forgiving person in an honest way, not because NBC told him that he had to.  Because actually, if you think back to that moment, because Dan Crenshaw was so gracious about it, and he laughed about and he forgave, he's the one that forgave Pete even if he thought the apology was fake, whatever. He was willing to say, look, we can all get along and that was a really great moment, and the country came together for a minute. And then to walk all over that seems like a real shame.  COMPAGNO: Jesse, why is even going back to that? Why doesn't he just stay quiet?  WATTERS: Well, he made it part of his act. And it didn't look like the job landed very well. I didn't hear a lot of laughs. Dana Perino made Crenshaw famous.  PERINO: No, Crenshaw himself is famous.  WATTERS: Yes, you did. Yes, you did. You had him on your show and he was a big deal after that. And listen --  GUTFELD: You also made fun of his eye. It was terrible. Yes, it was awful.  PERINO: I did not.  GUTFELD: Davidson stole your bit.  COMPAGNO: (INAUDIBLE) before you write that.  WATTERS: You know, he said one thing about Crenshaw on Saturday Night Live. Crenshaw can go on ""HANNITY,"" and it's the same number.  PERINO: Yes.  WATTERS: I mean -- and he's going on ""HANNITY"" more than once so people know him more than they know Pete Davidson.  PERINO: Absolutely.  WILLIAMS: You know, I think we're making --  WATTERS: But -- one more thing. I do like the idea of taking an apology back though. I respect that. I respect that.  COMPAGNO: You noted.  WILLIAMS: You know, that's exactly what I don't respect.  WATTERS: You don't respect that?  WILLIAMS: No, because I think --  WATTERS: But not if it was a fake apology to begin with, because he didn't really believe that apology.  WILLIAMS: No. So, I was listening to what he said, even though was part of his act, I think that's an important point to be made. And he said it was not because NBC executives told him to take it back that it was wrong, it's he said people were threatening him, right?  WATTERS: He did it for survival.  WILLIAMS: So, is this -- is this cowardice? I mean, I just think, you know, especially when you compare it to the -- to what the congressman had to go through in real life, the kind of sacrifice he made for us as Americans, you think, wait, I'm saying -- so you're saying, now you're going to two years later come back and tell people that was a phony apology. I just think that's --  PERINO: Well, now what should happen is everybody should go and watch Dan Crenshaw's video that he did against socialism that started -- that came out yesterday. I think it was on Twitter. You go to his page. Now Pete Davidson just made him even more famous and hurt Bernie Sanders.  COMPAGNO: Yes. All right, now to our second topic. There's Jussie Smollett. He is maintaining his innocence despite being charged again in the alleged hate crime hoax that falsely implicated Trump supporters. Take a look. Oh, got it. OK, so --  PERINO: So what happened is --  COMPAGNO: Yes, basically he said he's going to fight or die to this. He maintains his innocence. I say he can fight or die all he wants on his own dime. Stop wasting everybody's tax dollars. Bye, girl.  WILLIAMS: Wait a second. Wait a second. He got -- they took him back to court. He didn't offer to go back to court. I don't know what the fancy could have, but let's see.  COMPAGNO: He just -- OK, fine.  WATTERS: I think -- I think the only thing he can do is he has to do an interview and he has to tell the host, this is how I lied, this is how the whole thing went down, and I am sorry. And only then will he become someone that people can say, you know what, let's give him a pass, he's OK now.  PERINO: On ""WATTERS WORLD?""  WATTERS: But until he does that, he's going to be hated.  GUTFELD: On ""WATTERS WORLD?""  COMPAGNO: Yes. Would you take -- would you --  GUTFELD: I'm ready to receive him.  COMPAGNO: Yes, you are.  PERINO: I think it's terrible that he lied, and then he put the police at - - well, in this position of making it look like they lie, like they were part of this. But also, think about those two Nigerian brothers that are -- that he roped into this.  GUTFELD: Literally.  PERINO: Yes, literally. And these guys cannot get jobs again, take care of themselves, and he is still lying about it. It's pretty rude.  COMPAGNO: Totally. Take us home.  GUTFELD: To make it interesting, innocent until proven guilty. I'm going to believe he's innocent until proven guilty.  PERINO: So that you get the interview.  GUTFELD: Yes. Jussie, I'm with you 100 percent, OK, you and O.J.  COMPAGNO: All right, everyone, ""ONE MORE THING"" is up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WILLIAMS: Welcome back. It's time for ""ONE MORE THING."" Emily?  COMPAGNO: Hey guys. OK, I was so excited to share this with you. So it was my absolute honor to be part of Helicopters for Heroes this weekend in Ennis, Texas, which is veterans and patriots honoring combat wounded vets with a helicopter hog hunt, tons of festivities, live music, and fellowship, and witnessing the impact that these organizations have on veterans.  It's such a blessing. I was humbled to have given the opening remarks to these guys. And this year, the event included veterans who are beneficiaries of the Independence Fund, the foundation for Exceptional Warriors and Sons of the Flag. I got to share the stage with General Bolduc and I was floored, I have to say, when I received coins from U.S. Army Medal of Honor recipient Robert Patterson, and Lieutenant Colonel Bruce Stacy. I could not be more grateful for this experience.  And I just want to tell you guys, if you have time, please go to my Instagram. Please go to Helicopters for Heroes Instagram so you can learn more. I put the names of every single veteran that was honored and participated and I think it's important that we all bear witness to them.  WATTERS: So you shot hogs from a helicopter?  COMPAGNO: I missed but I did shoot at a helicopter.  WATTERS: What kind of gun were you shooting?  COMPAGNO: I don't even know. Those guys, they were -- they shot 530 --  WATTERS: You don't know.  COMPAGNO: No. What?  WATTERS: Was it like a rifle? No, it was like --  WATTERS: Was it like a handgun?  WILLIAMS: Was it legal.  COMPAGNO: No -- yes, it was definitely legal. If I -- if it was in my hands, it was definitely legal. Yes, I don't know what kind of gun. I'm sure I'm sounding terrible right now.  WILLIAMS: No, no, but it sounds like you had a great time.  COMPAGNO: Yes. It was -- it was really amazing.  WILLIAMS: All right, Gregory.  GUTFELD: I haven't done this in a while. Let's do this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: I hate these people.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: You know, I don't post on Instagram very often and sometimes I get in trouble for posting food. But you know what I hate? I hate when I post a picture of my wife and everybody says how much I married up. Do you think that's cute?  PERINO: Way up.  GUTFELD: It's like 1,500 replies.  WATTERS: No, they mean like literally. She's taller than you.  GUTFELD: That is true. She has to pick me up sometimes to kiss me. It's kind -- it's kind of adorable. And she does change me. I mean, literally, she has changed me.  WATTERS: Yes, yes.  GUTFELD: But you know what? I have some qualities too. It's not all about physical appearance, you shallow jerks.  WILLIAMS: Wow.  WATTERS: She married up, Greg.  GUTFELD: Yes, she did marry up.  WATTERS: She married up.  GUTFELD: Thank you, Jesse.  WILLIAMS: All right, so we're having a problem with our video system here at Fox News at the moment, just momentarily but --  GUTFELD: Act out your ""ONE MORE THING.""  WILLIAMS: So we could -- we could play charades.  COMPAGNO: Yes.  WILLIAMS: But I have another idea. I want you, Jesse, to tell me the most interesting thing that you encounter today.  GUTFELD: Do the what -- yesterday, what happened yesterday in the subway.  WATTERS: No, I'm not going to talk about that. You know what, Juan, I'm going to act out my ""ONE MORE THING.""  WILLIAMS: Go for it, baby.  WATTERS: All right, so there was a truck driver and they got stalled out a railroad track. So stuck, all right, on a railroad track.  WILLIAMS: This is charades.  WATTERS: The train comes and barrels into the truck and it's like boom. No one's hurt though. Everybody survived, so you got to look out.  GUTFELD: Is that you ""ONE MORE THING?""  WATTERS: Yes.  GUTFELD: Wow, that was great.  WATTERS: And also, I'm on ""TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT."" The quiz at 8:00 Eastern.  GUTFELD: You're up against Lou?  WATTERS: No, Pete Hegseth.  GUTFELD: Oh, it's interesting.  WILLIAMS: All right, Dana, it's your turn.  PERINO: OK, so mine was just about this. We don't really need a video for this. I thought this is really cool. To Kill a Mockingbird, everyone knows the great book.  GUTFELD: You would kill a bird?  PERINO: No.  GUTFELD: That's a terrible ""ONE MORE THING.""  PERINO: That would be Emily.  PERINO: OK, so well, that book is a play here on Broadway. And there was a really cool history made last night at Madison Square Garden. They had 18,000 public school children come to Madison Square Garden and see Harper Lee's iconic book performed by Ed Harris, who's Atticus Finch right now. That's the main character. And it was amazing that they got a chance to do this. This is the first time that a Broadway play has been done in Madison Square Garden and I wish I'd been there.  WILLIAMS: I thought it was just fabulous. And so my ""ONE MORE THING"" had to do with a school teacher who for Black History Month, you know, it's at the end of it, came dresses a different character out of black history every day.  PERINO: Oh that's neat.  WILLIAMS: Even President Trump is today having a meeting about black history.  Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

65,FOX,"Democratic debate descends into chaos. The Democratic presidential debate in South Carolina Tuesday night made “Dumb and Dumber” look like “Citizen Kane.” Some call it a disaster. Others call it a train wreck. I've seen more order in a prison riot. The constant over- and under-talking created an apt metaphor for Democrats: a daycare center with no supervision and no diapers.

They were like different species exchanging battle cries. Sadly, even the most capable adult, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, could barely tell a joke. It was sad, but not as sad as watching him apologize to a leftist for curbing crime.

66,FOX,"Democrats gang up on Sanders at debate; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" February 26, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: All right, in the meantime, stocks on the day so they need to be reassured your investors. But more important is to average folks. Here comes ""THE FIVE.""  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Hi, I'm Greg Gutfeld with Katie Pavlich, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and she looks up to Mother Teresa and doorknobs, Dana Perino, THE FIVE. Last night's debate makes dumb and dumber look like Citizen Kane. Some call it a disaster. Others a train wreck. Even the national institute of dumpster fires has weighed in.  Quote, ""please don't mention dumpster fires in the same breath as that debate. The debate was far worse. Glad we got that quote. So how bad was it, this bad?  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  (CROSSTALK)  PETE BUTTIGIEG (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If you get nominated, we'll be re-litigating this all year.  (CROSSTALK)  BERNIE SANDERS (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: First of all --  (CROSSTALK)  BUTTIGIEG: I think we were talking about -- it takes two hours to do the math.  (CROSSTALK)  JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Why am I stopping? No one else stops.  (CROSSTALK)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If you could honor the rules of the debate, thank you. Senator Sanders?  SANDERS: You are the moderators. Is it my turn?  (CROSSTALK)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: -- respectfully, if you would all, please try to keep to the --  (CROSSTALK)  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: I've seen more order in a prison riot. The constant over and under talking created an apt metaphor for the Dems, a day care center with no supervision and no diapers. Now, interim party debates require infighting, but are they in the same party, really? They were, like, different species exchanging battle cries. Sadly, the most capable adult could barely tell a joke.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  MICHAEL BLOOMBERG (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I really am surprised that all of these -- my fellow contestants up here, I guess would be the right word for it, given nobody pays attention to the clock. I'm surprised they show up because I would've thought after I did such a good job in beating them last week that they'd be a little bit afraid to do that.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: It was sad, not as sad as watching him apologize to a leftist for curbing crime, because once you do that they smell blood. And then there is no forgiveness, only punishment unless you're an actual criminal. But those aren't the big problems. It's way worse. That wasn't a debate. It was a launch party on the Titanic.  Last night, you saw the opposition toxin at work, where every idea is positioned as A versus B, men versus women, black versus white, gay versus straight. So when you talk about uniting a country, it's met with a smirk. Unity means oppression which is really oppression driven by bigotry incapable of uniting behind American ideals and free markets and free minds.  They shout about how bad everything is even when things are great. But things aren't great for everyone. They'll tell you. True, but your divisive message only makes things worse for people who want to do better and who are trying to do better. That's the oppositional mindset. Every answer ends with off with their heads.  The only way you can do better is if someone does worse. They even managed to politicize a global virus. That's not a message. It is a virus. And they are stuck with it. All right, Katie, what were your favorite moments?  KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, I think what you saw last night was -- South Carolina, a week out from Super Tuesday. This was the thrashing, the over talking, people are interrupting each other, not sticking to the rules, was a preview of dying, thrashing campaigns. This was the last stop for people like Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar, Mayor Pete.  They are done if they don't get any kind of boost out of this debate. And as we've seen, debates haven't really paid off in terms of support for other people. But I thought Elizabeth Warren had the weirdest attack of the night when she went after Mayor Bloomberg for allegedly telling an -- a female employee to kill her baby when she was pregnant, which kind of took away the left argument on the abortion issue.  So, like, on one hand, she's saying abortion is not killing. But then she accuses Michael Bloomberg of telling an employee to kill her baby, which I thought that Democrats were about choice. It's a very weird thing for her to say. And certainly, it didn't get her anywhere going into South Carolina on Saturday.  GUTFELD: Yeah. And they've never been able to back up that claim, anyway. Juan, was it CBS's fault or the Dems' fault for that chaos?  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, I think CBS should've been able to see something was quite was predictable, which is this was the last debate before Super Tuesday. It's not only South Carolina. It's Super Tuesday. And so there are a bunch of people, as Katie was just laying out, who see this as their last shot to make their case before the big vote, not only South Carolina but Super Tuesday.  So to me, understanding that these people are desperate and that they are hungry and that they are going to claw, and spit and fume. They should've had better, you know, guard rails to make sure that there wasn't -- I mean, here at this table, I think we make an effort not to over talk because the audience gets angry. The audience doesn't like it.  GUTFELD: Exactly.  WILLIAMS: And I think it comes across as, you know, lacking not only in decorum but in effectiveness if you're trying to deliver a message. So I think that that's a mistake. I mean, what could they have done? I mean, you think about -- maybe you don't need moderators in some cases. Lincoln- Douglas didn't have a moderator.  But I would say that, you know, they should have been very clear about lanes and times, maybe bells and whistles -- Fox has done the whistles and had to do it actually in 2016 with the Republicans.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Electric --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: You know that's why we got to get you to be a moderator.  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: I know.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: Well, I've got to tell you this was like watching people fight over what kind of coffin they're going to be buried in. I went back and looked at past debate highlights from other cycles to see what I was missing. And Rubio, Cruz, Christie, Romney, all of these people would decimate any one of these people that we saw last night.  Just imagine what Trump would do. It's like a heavyweight versus a featherweight. Bernie Sanders doesn't even win the debate. He just gets to the left of every body and pounds the podium. He has no depth of knowledge about his own proposals. Everything is so thin. You punch him one time and he just says billionaire. I mean, that's not going to last.  He's going get eaten alive, eventually. Mike Bloomberg has no personality. He just memorizes talking points and delivers them like a robot. I've never seen anybody so rich and successful bomb like that before. Be a boss. Then there is a Biden, who I guess was more vigorous, but he didn't have any macho moments. He gets run over by a moderator.  It's the most pathetic thing I've ever seen. Warren is the most annoying person I think I've ever seen on television. She's intolerable. And I have a very high tolerance level.  (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: Right now, all she says is, we need, we need, we need, we need. It's like a verbal tic that doesn't stop. She's not running for second place, which is pathetic, Bernie's attack dog. She played the gender card on him, went out in flames. And now, she's just carrying his water. Pete is the best debater, but he's a boy. I mean, he looks like a child out there.  He frames an issue very concisely, but he doesn't ever punch above his weight class. Every time he tries to hit one of the big dogs, he gets talked over. Amy lost her sense of humor. Where did that go? And Steyer's a passionate guy but he's like a Lizard. He's so hard to look at. You can't him seriously.  WILLIAMS: I think you are a Republican.  (CROSSTALK)  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: -- all the candidates.  WILLIAMS: I just think a lot of the stuff that, you know, we have been saying, we want them to fight. They should be fighting out there. So they're fighting -- but then the thing that really struck me going back to something Katie was saying. Like, the thing about the baby, you know I think -- by the way, Bloomberg didn't say it was false.  He just said I didn't say that. But you know what? But to me, no, no, because -- remember, what would've been false is to say that her being fired from the school because she said she was pregnant. This is Elizabeth Warren. He never said that was false.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: But to me, the fact that it gets thrown out there is so damaging to Bloomberg. And similarly, the whole racist thing about the guns and Sanders --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: He's getting annihilated out there.  WILLIAMS: Well, I don't know if he's getting annihilated, because I think he's doing pretty well in this contest.  WATTERS: Well, not by debating. I think his whole success is based on money and ads.  WILLIAMS: Who, Bernie?  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Speaking of ads, Dana, what was the worst thing -- I mean not worst, the weirdest and most surreal thing? I've never seen a campaign ad during a debate. Did you see that?  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: OK. So anyway, forget about -- we should talk about Bloomberg had an ad at the debate. But why don't they all do it?  PERINO: They don't have the money. That's an expensive ad.  GUTFELD: So does this all help -- I mean, like, doesn't this just make Trump look better when you see all of this? To Juan's point, it's true. They've got to fight but it just makes them look smaller.  PERINO: Any -- well, all incumbent presidents look better during the primary of the other party, because you're like, well, gosh, I mean you may not like him but at least there's this, that, and the other thing. I mean, so I think incumbent presidents have such a great advantage. A friend of mine teaches at a major university.  And he said that Elizabeth Warren reminds him of the students he likes the least. And then last I -- because I did book signing with Martha. I asked Peter to take some notes for me. And this is what he had for Tom Steyer. It's kind of like Jesse's -- not as funny, says Tom Steyer, the man has all the presence of a wet tissue, blaming the Senate for the fact that gun control cannot be done.  Nobody considers the fact that Obama had both the House and the Senate. And I think when Katie said that they are going after each other but they're not talking about -- it's so superficial. There is no actual debate about OK, what would you actually do? What are the issues that you would deal with? But Biden got very good news today with the endorsement from Jim Clyburn and the Palmetto State poll, which was the most accurate one for South Carolina in 2016 said Biden is up 35.  And the next one is Steyer at 17 and Bernie at 13. So this race could still be way out of whack because Biden could win South Carolina, doesn't have a lot of money to compete in Super Tuesday.  WILLIAMS: He just did buy some ads for Super Tuesday. But I've got to tell you. California is there and Bernie is up.  GUTFELD: All right, President Trump set for a news conference on the Coronavirus outbreak at 6:30. Fox News will cover live when it happens. Up next, Bernie's praise for communist Cuba didn't go over too well at the debate.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WATTERS: Socialist Bernie Sanders under fire during last night's debate over his love affair with Fidel.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SANDERS: What I said is what Barack Obama said in terms of Cuba, that Cuba made progress on education. Yes, I think -- really, really?  (CROSSTALK)  SANDERS: -- dictators -- whether it is the Chinese or the Cubans does something good, you acknowledge that. But you don't have to trade love letters with them.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: That was just the start of Bernie's problems, the Democratic frontrunner getting hit from all sides.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  BUTTIGIEG: Imagine spending the better part of 2020 with Bernie Sanders versus Donald Trump.  (CROSSTALK)  AMY KLOBUCHAR (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: -- someone in charge of this ticket who wants to put forward $60 trillion in spending, three times the American economy? I don't think we do.  BIDEN: You're talking about what we are talking about with Bernie. Bernie, in fact, hasn't passed much of everything.  ELIZABETH WARREN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I dug in. I did the work. And then Bernie's team trashed me for it.  KLOBUCHAR: Bernie.  BLOOMBERG: Bernie.  BIDEN: Bernie.  BUTTIGIEG: Bernie Sanders.  SANDERS: I'm hearing my name mentioned a little bit tonight.  (CROSSTALK)  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: All right. So he got the frontrunner treatment last night, Dana. I don't think the attacks are sharp enough and they bleeding him out. I think he survives.  PERINO: Also, why are they just doing it now? Bernie Sanders has had these positions for so long and they waited until he's already amassed delegates and he's got a foothold in the race. And he's basically saying, yeah, I know all of you are attack me 33 times compared to Bloomberg's 17 in this debate, because I have the leg up.  But all those attacks that are coming from within his own party are not going to look very good in general election ads that President Trump's team will run against Bernie Sanders. And the fact that Bernie isn't going to change his mind, I mean, maybe that works with Bernie. I will say this. I do think that his team has a much better campaign than the Hillary Clinton team.  They are organized. They are quick. They are kind of funny. They are everywhere. Did you see what they are doing in Minnesota going right into Klobuchar's backyard right before Super Tuesday with a band I didn't recognize? The night shifts or something, anyway --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: I'm going to find the band for you. Basically, he's -- they are super aggressive and they are smart. And I think that these things won't look good in a general election ad, but I don't think it hurts him in the primary.  WATTERS: Greg, explain to me why Bernie feels the need to say good things about bad people?  GUTFELD: Well, you know, it's like he was kind of half-right on Cuba. Cuba didn't make improvements in education. They made improvements in re- education. He got a little confused. And then when they was asked him how he was going to pay for his stuff, he said how much time do you have? So he couldn't even do it then.  But the scary part about the -- for the Dems, despite all of that, he still their best speaker. When he's up there, he knows how to shut people up by - - he gets in front. He gets up there. He's starts talking. And then he's not going to let this -- and he keeps going and he keeps going. And meanwhile, you have Buttigieg doing the under talk. Well, here I am over here. You have molecules --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: I'm over here and I'm talking and I'm relaxed and I'm confident. And I see that and I go Bernie is really good. He might be the most formidable against Trump on the debate stage.  WATTERS: Yeah, maybe. What do you think, Juan? I think Trump would chew him up alive. I mean, Bernie Sanders, one on one, Bernie has never really had to defend these crazy positions one on one.  WILLIAMS: Well, I think that's what he's doing now.  WATTERS: There is a field of seven or eight.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: I think he would -- you know what -- remember a line of you want to know who's the real socialist, the guy who is giving money to the rich, you know, I mean, it would be really strong. So I don't think that that's the problem. I think the problem is, and this is something that we have discussed or maybe they're watching THE FIVE, which is that left-wing people in general are two open to folks like Castro or the liberation movements in Latin America.  Or Northern Ireland, they are going to somehow say, you know what, this is the resistance. We understand you're up against the man, the big corporate interests, American military power. And the problem is that so often these movements turn out to be not good people. And I can tell you from my family history, people who oppress and who are discriminatory.  And then, you know, like, you know, the Sandinistas, how did we get involved with them? The other day, we were talking about the woman in, what Asian country who's now, you know, going at -- was it Myanmar going after - -  PAVLICH: Myanmar?  WILLIAMS: Myanmar, yeah, going after the dissidents and the minorities in her country. You know they gave her the Nobel Prize.  PAVLICH: Aung San Suu Kyi.  WILLIAMS: There you go. So I think that there's a problem in that regard. But my point is I don't think, Jesse, that it moves the needle for Jess -- for Bernie's supporters. I think if you're a guy and you are in Pennsylvania, and you say, you know what, I can't pay my healthcare premium in this country.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: You don't care what he says about Castro.  WILLIAMS: Yeah, the hell with Castro. If he's going to solve that problem for me, you are my guy, Bernie.  PAVLICH: Yeah. The Cuba utopia of healthcare and whatever else they say is free and good literacy has been a staple of the last since the Cuban revolution. I mean this is something that they've praise. It's been indoctrinated in college classrooms for decades. That's nothing new. But where it's really going to hurt Bernie in a general election is the first thing, his taxes.  He's going to raise taxes on every single a person in America, which he admits. He's going to take away your health insurance. The Green New Deal he supports is going to cost an average family $75,000 just for the first year, which is double the average of what the American family actually makes in the year. And then the other thing is if Bernie Sanders were to somehow win the White House, which I don't think that you should count him out at this point because we don't know.  The Squad is going to be running everything. AOC will be put in charge of something. All of her staffers get positions in the White House. Rashida Tlaib will get a position somewhere and all of her people will come with her and will be running the federal government.  (CROSSTALK)  PAVLICH: I don't know. But Ilhan Omar, same thing, she'll come in and be appointed to something --  (CROSSTALK)  PAVLICH: Maybe with her brother, yes.  (CROSSTALK)  PAVLICH: -- you know this is an entire restructuring of America.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Our ratings would skyrocket.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: You've convinced me this would be terrible for the country, but THE FIVE would be --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: All right. Next up, Liz Warren tries to smear Mike Bloomberg yet again. And did mini-Mike say that he bought Democrats?  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PAVLICH: Michael Bloomberg speared by Elizabeth Warren again, this time the liberal senator hitting Bloomberg's alleged kill it comment to a pregnant employee.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  WARREN: At least, I didn't have a boss who said to me kill it, the way that Mayor Bloomberg alleged to have said to one of his pregnant employees. People want a chance to hear -- people want a chance to hear from the women --  BLOOMBERG: I never said that.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PAVLICH: Turns out that personal story Warren told about being fired isn't exactly true. Plus, did Bloomberg really say last night that he bought Democrats during the 2018 midterms? Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  BLOOMBERG: They talked about 40 Democrats, 21 of those with people that I spent $100 million to help elect. All of the new Democrats that came in and put Nancy Pelosi in charge and gave the Congress the ability to control this president. I bought -- I got them.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PAVLICH: So Jesse, should he just own it? Like, he did infuse a ton of money, like he overturned the Virginia legislature at local level.  PERINO: Like, yeah, my money is beneficial to the Democrat.  WATTERS: You can't say the word bought. You can think it but you can't say it out loud. I mean he's there to stop Bernie and he can't even stop Liz. He's like a human hologram. Where is he? You can punch right through him and nothing would happen. He needs a shot of tequila before these debates. He's getting pushed around by Liz Warren who is a total fraud.  And just he keeps letting her hit him in the face over and over and over again. Drop the Pocahontas line, Mike. You are sitting there? Well, I did what she asked to do and I released these NDA's. What, so she's bossing you around? Mike was a killer on Wall Street. He would treat on Wall Street. He'd buy her and sell her and then go to the 21 Club and then laugh about it.  This is business, Mike. Treat this like a business and destroy her. You are getting used and abused and it's humiliating.  PAVLICH: I think Elizabeth Warren looked really unhinged with the way that she went after that comment, because it made no sense based on what she believes.  GUTFELD: I mean, the irony that she's pro-choice and is actually worried about a baby dying is a bit strange. But she's working for -- I believe that she's working for the VP slot for Sanders, which is why she did -- the very cultivated attack on him, in which 80 percent of it was really positive. We agree on everything.  But then you would trash -- wasn't really an insult. It was just a way to look like she wasn't really kissing his butt. You know, it's sad because Bloomberg is like the most effective person up there. He's the most successful person that offered actually reasonable responses about Israel, about climate and economy, and he is mocked by this, like, ignorant radical.  He's like a reputable speaker that shows up on campus and is heckled by social justice warriors who don't have jobs. All she is heckling him.  PAVLICH: Dana?  PERINO: I don't think that Elizabeth Warren will get the VP slot from Bernie Sanders, because did not endorse him in 2016 and there's a lot of bad blood about that in addition. Back when she ran for the Senate against Senator Scott Brown, Michael Bloomberg endorsed Mike -- endorsed Scott Brown over Elizabeth Warren.  So there is a lot of bad blood there that goes back a long way. And I think that because she comes across the way she does, I don't think that Bernie Sanders' campaign would be -- not smart -- I would say dumb enough to -- I'm trying to be nicer than that. But the other thing is, you know, she keeps bringing up the story that she got fired for being pregnant.  And if you look at townhall.com and Guy Benson who again, puts this out again today. He said, it's not true. That's not what happened. If you look at the documentation from the thing. And her stories have evolved over time. And I don't know why somebody like a Michael Bloomberg, or a Mayor Pete, or somebody else wouldn't say, by the way, that's actually not true and put her on the spot.  WATTERS: Yes, shut it down.  WILLIAMS: Well, I don't think -- I think there's this lot of context about what's true and what's not.  PAVLICH: No, it's actually not contested.  WILLIAMS: I do think so.  PAVLICH: It's pretty clear you should not --  WILLIAMS: But I think the bigger point here with Bloomberg is that Bloomberg has helped the Democrats greatly with his money, and it's not a matter of buying, even if he had used the word bought, he would be wrong. Because it's not that he was picking candidates and telling them change your position in order to support my business or the like. He was putting money to existing candidates, and that's legit. That's a good thing to do for the Democratic Party.  The one thing I'd say in response to some of the things I've heard here today is you think he's more accomplished than Joe Biden? You think he's more accomplished than Bernie Sanders?  WATTERS: I do.  PAVLICH: I do too.  WATTERS: Here's why, Juan. Not only did he create millions --  PAVLICH: Bernie Sanders? What?  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Wait a minute. Bernie Sanders has been a mayor, a congressman, a senator.  WATTERS: He's the mayor of New York City and he's created hundreds of thousands of jobs in his company.  WILLIAMS: Yes. In other words, you're saying, anybody who is a successful businessman is better than any politician?  GUTFELD: He ran New York.  WATTERS: Bernie has done nothing.  WILLIAMS: Oh, stop. Get out of here.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: Bernie has not done one thing in the USA.  WILLIAMS: Let me make your -- I'll make your argument for you because I'm not necessarily a Bernie guy. Bernie has not had the success in terms of a legislative record in the Senate that can compare even with Elizabeth Warren.  WATTERS: So he has no legislative record or business record.  WILLIAMS: Correct. But wait a second.  WATTERS: What record does he have?  WILLIAMS: He's won elections in his --  WATTERS: Winning elections isn't an accomplishment.  WILLIAMS: Oh, wait a minute. A minute ago, Bloomberg was accomplished because he was the mayor of New York.  WATTERS: So he's a life-long politician.  PERINO: Well, he won elections in New York.  WATTERS: He hasn't delivered anything for the people.  WILLIAMS: I think people who represent their constituents and served to the pleasure of their constituents are good politicians.  GUTFELD: All Bernie has passed is gaffe.  PAVLICH: All right, we got to go.  WATTERS: Bernie doesn't represent as many as constituencies, people in New York City. That's about what nine million here?  PAVLICH: Bernie Sanders --  WATTERS: How many people are in Vermont?  WILLIAMS: I think you complaining about De Blasio every day. Don't you complain about the -- how many votes --  GUTFELD: He deserves it, Juan.  WATTERS: I want Bloomberg back here, not De Blasio.  PAVLICH: All right, Bernie Sanders has ever made $1 on his own in his life. He's always been funded by the taxpayer. But coming up, Joe Biden guaranteeing he'll win in South Carolina after making one of his biggest gaffes yet.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WILLIAMS: We're awaiting President Trump's news conference on his administration's response to the coronavirus. The Center for Disease Control telling Americans to be prepared for the virus to spread here inside the United States. That news conference with the president coming up at 6:30 right here on Fox.  But first, some good news for Joe Biden in South Carolina. He just picked up a major endorsement from Democratic House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn. Biden very confident now heading into that primary this weekend.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I intend to win South Carolina and I will win the African American vote here in South Carolina.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If you don't win South Carolina, will you continue with --  BIDEN: I will win South Carolina.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: Biden being praised for having a good debate last night, but his performance didn't come without some gaffes.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  BIDEN: 150 million people have been killed since 2007 when Bernie voted to exempt the gun manufacturers from liability, more than all the wars, including Vietnam from that point on.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: So Dana, let me come to you on this. Obviously, I guess he didn't mean 150 million, he meant 150,000, something like that. And given what happened at the church in South Carolina, I thought it was a powerful point, but it's right. He was wrong, so people who are picking on about the gaffe, have it -- have something to work with.  But I was going to ask you about Biden exceeding expectations last night in the debate. Do you think it will help him in South Carolina?  PERINO: Well, I think -- I think that he was already in a fairly strong position in South Carolina. And that -- so remember he left New Hampshire before the voting had ended to get to South Carolina because that was his firewall. And so, he's been there for what, 10 days now. He's been going all around the state. He's got a lot of support there. So I think it lifted his spirits, gave him a little confidence.  I don't understand why he yells so much during the debates, because I'll tell you one thing I do think. I think that in 2024, the debates ought to consider not having an audience, because what happens is they're just going for an applause line, it gets disrupted, people get rattled, and then actually, as a voter, you can't actually get to some real meat of the issue.  And the moderator could have gently said, I'm sure you don't mean 150 million. Right, no, of course, 150,000. And all of us have those little verbal gaffes.  GUTFELD: Not me.  PERINO: I think that he'll do better because one, he got the Jim Clyburn endorsement. I think that came after the debate and maybe Clyburn was sort of waiting to see if that would happen. But also, there's this operation chaos that's happening with Republicans in South Carolina encouraging Republicans to cross in the primary to try to vote for Bernie or somebody like that. They're not trying to help Biden down there in South Carolina. So if he exceeds expectations, that'll be one thing, but if he doesn't, that might have something to do with it.  WILLIAMS: So what do you think, Jessie? Is it possible that Bernie Sanders could pull an upset here?  WATTERS: If operation chaos is successful. You'll never know.  WILLIAMS: You Republicans are tricky.  WATTERS: Yes. We're so -- we're so mischievous. He's winning in every single poll. So if all the polls are wrong, and Bernie pulls off an upset, wow, that's a big deal. But I just don't like the messaging coming out of the Biden campaign. They've been talking about a firewall for a month and a half. When there's a firewall that means there's a fire that they haven't put out yet. And the firewall is made up of black voters.  So if Biden does win South Carolina comfortably, it's not Biden that gets the credit, it's the black voters. But if he doesn't perform well in South Carolina, then the black voters get the blame, because they were disloyal to the first black president's V.P., and it's just an awkward situation to be in.  WILLIAMS: Well, I think that -- wouldn't you say that they picked Biden if they voted for him?  WATTERS: Yes, but I think that might have to do with leftover allegiance, not necessarily they're gung ho about Joe.  WILLIAMS: All right, so Greg, when you look at this I'm wondering what it means for Super Tuesday because, you know, if Biden wins big, does that mean that he's going to do better Super Tuesday? If Bernie wins, does it mean -- in South Carolina, does it mean the whole race is over?  GUTFELD: If he wins big, Joe wins big, that might help him Super Tuesday. But I still really feel uncomfortable about watch -- when I'm watching him. When he's feisty, I like it because it's funny when he gets exasperated and he tells stories and stuff. But then when he loses his place and he closes his eyes and you can see that he's frustrated, and then no -- it's no longer funny to me and it makes me -- it makes me sad that it's gaffes about -- it's gaffes about mental confusion, about dates and memories and what happened.  And we all see that with people that we know. And generally, you know, Dana has spinach in her teeth, somebody tells her. But there's nobody over on Joe's side saying stop. And it's like -- it's kind of like --  PERINO: And his campaign has not set him up for success. If you look at the advanced team for like a Bloomberg, it looks beautiful. Like the lighting is great. And almost every shot that Biden has had, it does not look professional. And he has been not served well by that.  PAVLICH: It's true.  WILLIAMS: Well, the one -- so the big news today, Katie, is the Jim Clyburn endorsement, and I wonder what you think. Does an endorsement matter in this day and age, even if it's Jim Clyburn, a black leader, 30 years in the Congress for a 60 percent black electorate in South Carolina.  PAVLICH: Jim Clyburn who also is a fan of Louis Farrakhan who refuses to condemn Louis Farrakhan, that Jim Cliburn? OK, well, I think it matters to Joe Biden in a place like South Carolina. But I agree with Dana that his team has not served him well moving forward. They've been very focused on a single demographic of voters in a single state, and California is already voting on early -- on Super Tuesday. In Texas, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are neck and neck when it comes to winning that state. Colorado is another one that people should be watching.  So it's great if he wins on Saturday, but it seems like they've been very narrowly focused with blinders on about trying to pull out South Carolina and hoping that somehow this changes the momentum against an opponent that has an entire movement behind him that is bringing in more people by the day. I don't see it happening.  WILLIAMS: All right, coming up next, stay with us, folks, because President Trump is getting ready for a news conference on the coronavirus, and there's a big political battle heating up over his handling of the outbreak. That's next on THE FIVE.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PERINO: President Trump is holding a news conference at the White House at 6:30 p.m. Eastern on the coronavirus outbreak. Health officials warning Americans to prepare for the deadly disease that has killed over 2,700 people worldwide as a number of Americans infected jumps to 60. And there's a political battle brewing, of course. Democrats are calling out the president over his handling of the virus.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): It is clear this administration is in total disarray when it comes to the crisis of the coronavirus. CDC said it's going to spread, the question is when. There is no plan. The administration has no plan.  REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): What he's doing is late, too late, anemic. Hopefully, we can make up for the loss of time. But it will have to have the professionals in place, the resources that are adequate, and not be given -- using scare tactics about people coming back to our country.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: The thing for me about that, Jesse, is that if it turns out that the administration needs additional funds, then they can ask for additional funds. Why this fight?  WATTERS: They're going to fight Trump no matter what he does. If he shuts the entire country down, they'll call him a racist and an idiot. And if he says we're assessing the risk, and we're going to take it day by day, they're going to say he's not paying enough attention and he's incompetent.  This is the safest country in the world to be during a time like this. I'm totally confident in the U.S. healthcare system. The United States doctors were probably going to find the virus vaccine to cure this. So, I was on the subway today. An Asian woman sat down. She had the mask on right next to me. I don't care. I didn't stand up. I'm not afraid of corona at all.  The other thing is you keep hearing lies from the left and the media about these cuts that Trump made to the CDC and the National Institute --  GUTFELD: Here we go.  WATTERS: We have the facts, folks. Those are lies. Every single year that Trump has been president, the funding for both of those agencies have gone up. The brain room, who we work with Juan, also says the Trump administration has spent more money on CDC and the NIH than the Obama administration ever did.  PERINO: But their budget proposals were to cut.  WILLIAMS: Thank you. I think you got busted.  WATTERS: No, that's not a bust. It's just a proposal.  WILLIAMS: OK, all right, this is like a Democratic debate and you were Bernie Sanders, buddy.  PERINO: But it doesn't matter.  WATTERS: I just faced you.  PERINO: Let me ask -- let me ask -- I want to ask Greg about something because remember when the Ebola concern happened during the Obama administration, there were the partisan questions about the Obama administration handling, that they handled it fine. I think that we should figure out a way to not make this partisan.  GUTFELD: I mean, this -- yes, everybody is looking for the Katrina moment, right? Whether your -- because the Katrina thing was the one that broke it, right? And so --  PERINO: But even then, I could argue it, but yes, I won't.  GUTFELD: You know, what I'm saying. You know exactly what I mean. Like, it was their way to lump something onto bush. And so then, the Ebola thing. If you want Trump to fail, then you're a scum. Because Trump fails, people die. So you want to -- you got to put that stuff aside. I'm right in the middle here between what Trump is saying and what the Democrats are saying.  If you tell us it's overblown, fine. As long as you're committed to over- preparing. And I'll be happy four months from now to admit that we panicked, or we acted appropriately. But I don't want to say it now when we're flying blind, when we don't know that like -- and by the way, I'm not on CNN or MSNBC, I'm on Fox News. I said, we had to close the country down on January 28.  PERINO: Early on, yes.  GUTFELD: They did it six days later. That delay cost us because there are people that got in and we have -- you know, we have -- we instituted a band to reduce the risk of radical Islamist to get into this country, an ideological virus. We should be doing this for a real virus.  PERINO: Katie, any thoughts?  PAVLICH: My thoughts are that people should take precautions as individuals for their households. Do things like storing water and food because if it comes to your community, you're not going to be able to leave. So I would just think about those things as we move forward with the press conference later and hear from the President and the CDC.  PERINO: And last word, Juan.  WILLIAMS: Well, I think Trump's people did a bad job. He's thinking eliminated positions that would have helped to prevent that. But you know what, it doesn't mean everyone's going to die. I have tremendous faith in the CDC and the NIH. I think they those people know what they're doing, and they have a track record that's astounding. I agree with Jesse on that point.  But I think the political implications are now becoming apparent to the Trump White House, and the stock market clearly is something that the President cares so deeply about.  GUTFELD: We all do.  WILLIAMS: And I think -- I think that's why the President is now deciding he's going to have a press conference.  GUTFELD: But the stock market reflects the confidence in the supply chains that are being affected. So obviously, people are concerned not just about the spread of it, but its impact on how you get food, how you get fuel --  WILLIAMS: I don't know. What I'm saying is something different, that I think the President is now having a press conference because he's alarmed at seeing the stock market take --  PERINO: Well, I think he also need to get back from India to that. We need to --  GUTFELD: But anyway, Marc Siegel -- Dr. Siegel is on ""TUCKER"" tonight and he has some breaking news from Nebraska.  PERINO: I'll be on after him.  GUTFELD: Oh, that's right. I'll be home eating ribs.  PERINO: All right, ""ONE MORE THING"" is up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: Oh Welcome back. Holy crap.  PERINO: We're on air.  GUTFELD: Yes, Juan, ""ONE MORE THING.""  WILLIAMS: OK. You know those kids, those kids, they dance around and make all kinds of foolish gestures on platforms like Tick Tock in order to get a big social followers.  PERINO: Oh, no, this is terrible, Juan.  WILLIAMS: Well, take a look at Steven Austin at Fort Worth, Texas.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is cooking with Steve. I got frozen biscuits.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: 81-year-old is beating the kids with simple videos of him making sandwiches, pancakes, even toasts. For example, the video you just saw is Steve cooking frozen biscuits. It's his biggest hit with 8.5 million views. His number one request, those young folks are asking him to be their grandpa. Way to go, old man, Steve. That's not insulting. That's the name of his account on Tick Tock.  WATTERS: Yes, a man is going to teach me how to make toast. You put the bread in the toaster.  WILLIAMS: You know, you young people are -- you young people are condescending --  PAVLICH: The millennials need some help, Jesse.  PERINO: I thought you're going to do the school crushing viral video. I'm going to show you later.  WILLIAMS: Don't show me skull-crushing, please.  GUTFELD: Jesse?  WATTERS: All right, Greg, what happens when a flight is so turbulent? What happens?  GUTFELD: I'll take a crapload of valium.  WATTERS: OK, well, if you're the flight attendant, this is how you hand out snacks. All right, so she was just rolling the peanuts and the crackers, and the cookies down the aisle. I think that's a very, very good idea. Also, if you're thirsty, there are two servings of waters tonight. That's right. ""WEDNESDAYS WITH WATTERS"" and I'll be on ""THE QUIZ SHOW"" with Shillue on Fox Nation. Check that out.  PERINO: All right, mine is fast. Dogs always enjoy car rides, but this little guy was having a real ball with his. Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, he's holding it with his hands. He's holding it with his hands. Hi buddy. Where's your bowl? Where's your bowl? Oh, no.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: Everybody was like oh. Thankfully, he did not chase it out the window. I'm sure his owner gave him a new one but isn't that cute?  GUTFELD: I'm going to beat that one with this one.  WATTERS: No, you're not.  GUTFELD: I guess I'm not. Oh my God, Greg's Beach News. You know what? Check out this dog.  WATTERS: I love this director.  GUTFELD: That is perfect. Whoever is doing the show tonight, see me in my office at 6:00. We have a long discussion about your future.  PERINO: What's this dog doing?  GUTFELD: He's just getting covered in foam.  PERINO: Oh, foam.  GUTFELD: Remember those -- remember those foam raves -- those foam raves? Jesse and I used to go to those in the 90s.  WATTERS: That's right. You don't know who you're touching down there.  GUTFELD: Katie, get this out of --  PAVLICH: OK. So I got that story for Greg, because Amazon now has a store, a grocery store in Seattle, it's 10,000 square feet, and you don't need anything to check out. Nobody is -- you don't have a cashier, there are people to help you. You walk in, you scan your app, and then everything is sensitive and digitized. So everything you take off goes into your car, and you walk out the door, and it goes straight to through your Amazon account. So you don't have to worry about standing in line. Just go grab what you need and walk out?  WILLIAMS: What happens -- what happens when a bad guy goes and they steal?  PAVLICH: Well, you have someone --  (CROSSTALK)  PAVLICH: You have to scan -- you have to scan in at the front.  WILLIAMS: OK.  GUTFELD: Set your DVRs. Never miss an episode of THE FIVE.

67,FOX,"Sanders praises Fidel Castro; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" February 25, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Well, all these concerns and unknowns a big reason for stocks to settle again today. What will they do tomorrow? We'll be on that on both Fox Business and this fine network. Right now, here comes ""THE FIVE.""  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everybody. I am Jesse Watters along with Katie, Juan, Dana, and Greg Gutfeld. What is he doing? It is 5:00 in New York City, and this is THE FIVE. A lot of big 2020 news to tell you about, including Bernie Sanders refusing to back away from his love affair with communist Cuba. And will mini-Mike Bloomberg take another beating on the debate stage tonight?  That's all coming up later. But first, President Trump mixing up with the liberal media before leaving for India, Donald Trump hitting back against the failing narrative that Russia is trying to help him get re-elected.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: They never told me anything about that. And it was sort of a strange thing that it went to Bernie. It was highly exaggerated. And frankly, I think it's disgraceful. And I think it was leaked from the intelligence committee. I think probably Schiff leaked it -- people within that -- Schiff leaked it, in my opinion. And he shouldn't be leaking things like that, that's a terrible thing to do.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: President Trump saving his best jabs, though, for CNN's Jim Acosta.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: I want to know how -- from any country, and I haven't been given help from any country. And if you see what CNN, your wonderful network said, I guess they apologized in a way for -- didn't they apologized for the fact that they said certain things that weren't true? What was their apology yesterday? What did they say?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President, I think our record on delivering the truth is a lot better than yours --  (CROSSTALK)  TRUMP: Let me tell you about your record. Your record is so bad. You ought to be ashamed of yourself.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm not ashamed of anything.  (CROSSTALK)  TRUMP: -- the worst record in the history of broadcasting.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: And just when we thought sore loser Hillary Clinton had gotten over 2016, she is back warning about Russia.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES: Obviously, we know the Russians are continuing to try to choose our next president like they chose our last president. And we just have to be more vigilant, and people have to pay attention to trying to get the best possible information and, you know, don't believe everything you see on the internet. That is one of the greatest challenges facing democracy right now.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: Dana, she used to say, well, this was my excuse and this was my excuse. But you know what? I've lost and I take responsibility. That is out the window now. Now, she is just saying Russia chose Trump.  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Yeah. They -- it -- you can never actually heal from an election and recover if you don't -- if you're not honest with -- for the reasons. Now, she truly seems to believe that Russia gave President Trump the election. There have been several investigations, at the highest levels of the government that have not proven that to be so.  And yes, it has -- does Russia want to put some ads out there? Do they like to meddle? Probably, yes, that's -- but I think that -- for President Trump one of the ways to answer those questions is to say I don't need their help.  WATTERS: Right.  PERINO: I have a record. I ran on this record. I don't need their help. And we -- like, please, if you are trying to help me, I don't need your help. Something like that would just be more, like I said yesterday, derisive of Russia rather than building them up to be something that they are not.  WATTERS: Greg, Jim Acosta, I mean, the nerve to say that CNN has a great track record on telling the truth. Wow, I don't know.  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, CNN's ratings are in steep decline. And we see that because we see the ratings everyday. And it is because, I believe, they've lost the trust of the American people by becoming the weekly world news for Trump derangement. It's like everybody -- it's like, if they can link the batboy to Trump, they are going to put it on the cover.  And it's like they can't see themselves. So I'm going to go on a little bit of a rant against the media. We'll try something new, Juan, if you don't mind.  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Why try anything new?  GUTFELD: Well, this is an epiphany, OK? So we have watched the fourth estate shattered since 2016, embarrassment after embarrassment, right? After -- I or you, we have been living decades kind of in this sealed narrative of cultivated stories that help make money for these corporatist companies. But I started thinking that it's not actually about the events, which are Russia, Avenatti, Smollett, Covington, Kavanaugh.  It's the fact that it all happened in a concentrated time, all in succession. It used to be isolated, like, things, like, Borque (ph) or Richard Jewell. But in the last four years, we have seen so many of them. And I'm beginning to wonder if it's because there are more of them or because we have become so red-pilled that now we finally see them for what they are.  And now, we question everything that we didn't question before, like, we question are we getting the right stuff about Coronavirus? Do we -- are we getting the real story? And I think that is super healthy that we now -- we do not trust this. And, like, the one of Trump's big achievements is that he just -- he put a scar across the face of media that will never go away.  And that everybody can see that scar for the rest of their lives. And I think it's super important.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: -- because there is some evidence that Russia has been spreading misinformation about the Coronavirus online on purpose to cause people fear and chaos. And that is someplace where President Trump could turn around and say knock it off. Enough of that, and I think he's in a position where he can do that.  WATTERS: Katie, you're seeing all of these kinds of fake new scandals, as Greg mentioned, happening in a condensed period of time because the media is so desperate. They have to manufacture this to get Trump out of office as fast as possible. And because it's a 24-hour news cycle now, they have to keep generating rating after rating point.  I saw CNN do a thing yesterday that Trump was going to freak out because there is no beef and then -- and they had three reporters assigned to the by-line.  KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS HOST: That was the headline, like, is the president going to be able to survive India on vegetarian meals that are served to him at the state dinner. I think there are bigger issues to talk about. But you know what Russia loves? Russia loves that Americans are being pitted against each other, which is exactly what they are always trying to do and that they are talking about Russia.  They are not interested necessarily in a certain candidate, whether it's Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton. They just want us fighting with each other. And when people like Adam Schiff go through an entire impeachment process and hours on the floor talking about Russia, whether it's the Mueller investigation dragging out.  Whether its people on television making this claim and the latest claim they had to walk back with the intelligence now showing they are helping Bernie Sanders win the primary now. Russia doesn't care. They only care that we are fighting with each other and that Americans are at each other's throats. And that's exactly what they've been successful at doing for the past three years.  And the question is are people going to continue to allow them to do that. We are so concerned about Russian meddling. Why don't we stop getting them so much credit for doing something that they're not actually in control of?  WATTERS: Yeah.  GUTFELD: They're getting free media.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: But just -- if you use common sense, wouldn't you just think that maybe Putin would want Bernie since Bernie wants to slash defense spending? He wants to get rid of space for us.  WILLIAMS: Wait a second. Wait a second. Wait a second. I mean, this has been so twisted here at this table. I don't even know where to start. But let me just say --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Yeah. Hillary Clinton did not go off about the Russians helping Donald Trump. What she said was the Russians continued to interfere, continued to spread misinformation.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: And let me just say. They not only hacked Hillary Clinton if you recall, but then used it against her campaign. They weaponized the information in such a way that drove mainstream media to cover it as if it was news.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: -- and they were played along like a bunch of fools.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: -- the American people and then you say --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: What is Hillary Clinton --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: No, they certainly did not. And not only did they do that, they went after so many other things, including, by the way, my phone number. So I want to tell you something that's very real. So if Hillary Clinton says - - if Hillary Clinton says -- and before you distort it, Hillary Clinton says you know what, you have to be careful about what you read on the internet and it is disinformation. I think we should --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: I know you don't like Hillary Clinton, but that's the truth.  WATTERS: Russia, if you're listening, find Juan --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Let me add something here. Let me finish. You've got to understand that Trump -- I will take Trump at his word that he wasn't told about Russia interfering to help him. Because remember, I think it was one of his chief of staffs told Kirstjen Nielsen when she was over at Homeland Security don't mention anything about Russia and Trump.  It upsets him. So maybe people don't want to tell him. But if that's the case -- let's also take it at faith because it is also true that Russia interfered in 16. And everybody who has investigated, from the top levels of government to people who are online, say the bots and the Russians continue to interfere.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: In order to push the story for four years, you have to ignore the biggest foreign interference story of all, which is the damn dossier. You guys sit and talk about little bots. Guys, use the dossier.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: You cannot be taken seriously.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: -- every night, it's the media.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Trump uses the internet just like the Russians.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: Stop talking, Juan. Stop talking.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: You are killing yourself, Juan. You are killing yourself.  WILLIAMS: Donald Trump is killing America.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: Juan, you just got back from Disney World.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: You know what? You can walk around with a Trump hat on.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: -- all right, coming up, the Democratic frontrunner can't stop praising communism and Fidel Castro. See Bernie's comments next on THE FIVE.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WILLIAMS: Twenty-twenty frontrunner Bernie Sanders set to become a big target during tonight's Democratic debate that's in South Carolina. The candidates setting off a firestorm over his comments about Fidel Castro's Cuba, Sanders was not backing away from it last night.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  BERNIE SANDERS (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: When Fidel Castro first came to power, he initiated a major literacy program. I think teaching people to read and write is a good thing. I have been extremely consistent and critical of all authoritarian regimes all over the world.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Castro, he destroyed freedoms in that country. He played -- picked winners and losers and killed them and put them in prison forever. You don't give him a pat on the back for anything.  SANDERS: You don't give -- it's not a -- truth is truth.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: Well, you just heard that applause, Katie. Do you think it's the case that people who don't like Bernie Sanders say, oh, look at that? He is praising a dictator, but people who do like him, they don't change their opinion about it because they say, well, maybe he wants to go back to Obama's policies or maybe he is about delivering on better healthcare for the American people.  PAVLICH: OK. But this is not just about him praising one dictator. This is about him praising an entire communist system, which he is now embracing and talking about bringing to the United States through many of his policies. He says the truth is the truth. Well, he's not telling the truth about what the literacy classes were in Cuba.  There are re-education camps -- gazed to concentration camps where they're worked to death. But this is actually a long history of the left. The glorification of Cuba has been a staple in the leftist platform for decades. And let's not forget that Barack Obama opened the door to normalization with this kind of Cuban tyranny when he was president by going to a baseball game with Raul Castro and doing the wave with members of the FARC were at the game with him.  So this is something the left they've been promoting for years. They've always said look at the Cuban healthcare system. What they don't show you is people dying with -- it's just like the Venezuelan healthcare system where people don't actually have healthcare. They have a system that doesn't work. So Bernie Sanders is not going to walk this back.  But he is also not telling the truth about what the Cuban regime actually is. And there were not good parts of it, and they're not good parts of it today either, despite more people being able to visit Cuba while the other people who actually live there starving so that tourists can have their nice resorts.  WILLIAMS: All right. Well, so, Jesse, I think that what we're likely to hear tonight is a little bit of a different take. I don't think that they're going too hard at that although it's possible. It's more like hey, Bernie, aren't you going to raise taxes to pay for some of these programs? The counter, I think being, a lot of people don't care, especially people who just want a solution to their medical -- high medical costs or prescription drug prices.  WATTERS: The way to take out burning is to treat him like the fool he is. Say, Bernie, you can't even do math. Here's a calculator. Say Bernie, you've been in D.C. your whole life, you never got anything done. Why would we think you get something done as president? I'd cast him as anti-Obama. I'd cast him as anti-Hillary. I'd say, Bernie, you're running on a platform that says if you like your healthcare plan, you can't keep it.  That's dumb politics and dumb policy. I would say he is a weirdo. Greg can get into the specifics --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: -- some of the erotic writings that he's delivered -- getting kicked out of communes while everybody else on that stage was teaching, working, serving in the military, you know, raising money, creating jobs. The guy's wife was a scam artist. She got caught with her little college deal. And the guy just had a heart attack hiding his medical records.  I would go straight at Bernie because he can't take a punch. You saw when Bloomberg mentioned his three homes. He started flustering, like, he was a fraud caught red-handed. But you can't go after his supporters. You have to do it in a way that say Bernie is deceiving you and he can't get anything done because he can't -- and he won't want because it is not possible.  I will deliver help on healthcare loans or anything else you need because Bernie has no track record of doing anything.  PERINO: And what he will get done will make him miserable.  WILLIAMS: I think -- Trump said he's going to get something done on healthcare and a wall. I don't --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: -- it's coming.  WILLIAMS: All right, all right. So Dana, let's to move on from Bernie to Bloomberg, because Bloomberg had a terrible debate last time, I don't think he's going to be as targeted as he was in Nevada. But how would you go if you are Bloomberg to get back in the race?  PERINO: Well, here's the thing. Every one of us has had a better line for Bloomberg than his own team has come up with or that he has delivered. Maybe they came up with some good lines. But honestly, like, if you want debate prep, might as well watch THE FIVE because that will help you better than anyone else. The thing that happened today is Elizabeth Warren cut an ad that was attacking Bloomberg.  So she's continuing to punch down. She's afraid to punch at Bernie. And I don't see how anyone is going to take Bernie out if they're not willing to go after him. And if Bloomberg isn't effective in doing so where all these millions he's spending isn't going to be effective, then no one is going to stop Bernie's roll. And on the thing about Cuba, President Obama -- correct me if I'm wrong.  I'm looking at Katie here. So remember, Obama didn't do the majority of his Cuba stuff until after he won a second term, because he wanted to win Florida. Already, you have Democrats in south Florida, Shalala being one of them, saying no, Bernie, like, that is not how our constituents think. So he is already causing problems for Democrats who are downstream from him.  And they are saying absolutely not. The last thing I would say is Bernie is so much more comfortable with government than with individuals and personal responsibility and freedom. That I would -- that's -- if I were like a Mayor Pete, I might go after him in that direction.  WILLIAMS: In fact, Mayor Pete is saying, Greg, that he -- that if you choose Sanders as the Democratic Party nominee, he is going to hurt down ballot, House races, Senate races, that it would just be devastating. What do you say?  GUTFELD: I say that all of these arguments are incredibly similar to the same arguments made about Trump. And there was one thing that Bernie has in common with Trump, is that he won't back off the things he says. So he doubled down on Cuba, why, because he actually believes it. He believes it. And it's kind of refreshing to hear a Democrat be honest, you know?  And if you want to read more about Bernie, I would suggest the Mother Jones article from 2015. Google it and you will see some of his writings. My favorite thing, again, is when the media is shocked, just shocked. You are seeing them shocked now that the guy who calls himself a socialist does in fact endorse socialism. They're like oh, my god, on The View.  Let's get everybody from Shark Tank on and sabotage the guy you named your dog after. Why was Bernie getting a free pass this entire time? It is only one reason. The media has a very shallow talent stack, right? They have no expertise in economics, so they can't write -- they can't ask the questions that can take somebody like Bernie out.  So Bernie can talk about -- I mean, he's been around forever talking about never having to pay for stuff, free stuff. And now we are just getting to these questions.  WATTERS: And his answers are so pedestrian. I think he told Anderson Cooper I can't account for every nickel and dime. How about every billion or trillion, Bernie?  WILLIAMS: The question is whether or not people who have those concerns really they care about the cost because they see the rich guy --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: -- Bernie is consistent just like a stopped clock. He has only been in one position his entire life and he is waiting for the rest of us to get there. But we might there, but the next minute over, he is wrong again. And that's what people are going to find out.  WILLIAMS: Well, that's the question. I guess you have to talk to his supporters. Straight ahead, Michael Bloomberg took a beating at that first debate, as I mentioned. So does the billionaire have a plan to fight back tonight? Stay with us on THE FIVE.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PERINO: -- Michael Bloomberg, we're in for another rough night on the debate stage. The billionaire is preparing to fight back and will reportedly nuke Bernie Sanders. But newly leaked audio from 2016 about Barack Obama is making him a target again.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  MICHAEL BLOOMBERG (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The second Obama election, I wrote a great backhanded endorsement of Obama, saying I thought he hadn't done the right thing, hadn't been good at things that I think are important. And Romney would be a better person at doing that, but Romney did not stick with the values that he had when he was governor of Massachusetts.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: So Juan, is that going to hurt Bloomberg in tonight's debate when everyone is trying to get to the -- on the good side of Barack Obama?  WILLIAMS: I think so. But, you know, it's an interesting. It's an interesting dance, because I think at the same time this is part of what makes Bloomberg so attractive in the general election, Dana. I think that kind of attitude would play well when you're trying to pick off some moderate Republican voters who were upset by Trump's behavior and the like.  Bloomberg is not in any far left guy. I could vote for Bloomberg. But in the primary process, it's a huge liability. He would have to get through the primary to get to the general election. So what this comes across as is, though, he's a little bit of an arrogant guy, that he's very much about him as opposed to the party or the legacy of protecting the Obama and Democratic Party.  PERINO: Greg, the Vegas debate was really the first one that moved the needle at all unlike in 2016 where candidates were dropping like flies after debates, even though there were 20 people on stage to begin with. It narrowed down pretty quickly. Somebody like a Bloomberg, is he going to apologize again tonight for what he said about Obama?  GUTFELD: The question is will Bloomberg have a stronger debate than he did last time? How could he not? When he got out of bed this morning, it already qualified as a stronger debate. So if he shows up -- the strategy I think he has to be for this debate, be the only person up there who is pro- America, pro-capitalist, pro-freedom.  You know, he is on stage with a group of people who have very little positive to say about running a business, which he does or the greatest economic system ever. You know, Jesse, he should look at Bernie and he should say if you were in Cuba, those stance (ph) in your chest would be made of wood and you would be dead.  WATTERS: It's a great line.  GUTFELD: It is a great line.  WATTERS: Bloomberg must not be watching, because we gave me great advice last time.  PERINO: Also, I came up with that line.  GUTFELD: That was -- no, was that your line or Jesse's  PERINO: It's mine.  GUTFELD: I thought it was Jesse's. I stole it though. I stole it.  WATTERS: You can have it.  PAVLICH: It was Dana's.  PERINO: But I want to ask you this. Does Michael Bloomberg his debate style make Biden look better and give him more of a shot at South Carolina?  WATTERS: That's a good question. You know, Biden kind of coasted last debate and people overlooked them. Biden, I think needs a positive moment tonight to keep him relevant. It depends on if he makes that moment for himself. We haven't seen any evidence that he has the talent to do that. I just don't know about Bloomberg. I don't have confidence that Bloomberg can slay Bernie Sanders.  We haven't seen any evidence that he can go out there and meet Bernie's energy up here. I think his biggest strength is that he's a billionaire. But Bernie's biggest strength is that he's crusading so hard against billionaires and his tactics can backfire. If you come in and you try to buy the nomination, and you try to tell everybody to get out of the field so I can take Bernie out one on one, that's not democratic. Bernie can easily hit him for that.  And Bloomberg is going to have to be playing offense and defense. It's just too tough of a -- of a poll for him.  WILLIAMS: You got two billionaires on the stage because Steyer is there tonight. He qualified.  PERINO: He's an afterthought, though.  GUTFELD: Then you have -- then you have like millionaires on stage. Don't forget the millionaires. Bernie is a millionaire.  PERINO: Yes, all of them. All of them except for Mayor Pete, right? Speaking of money, I wanted to ask you this, Katie. So Bloomberg is spending a ton to get his own poll numbers up, but he has said that he is committed to using all of his money to help beat President Trump no matter who the nominee is.  PAVLICH: Right.  PERINO: And yet, he's also now saying he's going to spend millions trying to nuke Bernie. How does that work?  PAVLICH: So they're trying to reconcile this party unity to make sure they can beat Trump with going against all the people in the primary race right now, and it's not really working. So the time for unity is after someone wins. You can make that argument once someone locks down the nomination. But to say -- and to undercut your own campaign by saying I'm spending all this money vote for me, but if I get beat by someone else, I will certainly help them in the end. But you know, it's Joe Biden's last stand, especially since he's running for senator in South Carolina.  PERINO: I know. He kind of had a little slip-up today.  GUTFELD: Vote for another Biden.  PERINO: Also, I need to give back the line credit to Jesse even though I had the original concept, and then Jesse had the better line, but just probably the way --  GUTFELD: But don't forget. I was the one who stole it.  PERINO: All right, Joe Biden is looking for a big one in South Carolina to turn things around. And as Katie just alluded to, a new gaffe threatens to derail his momentum. We'll show it to you next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PAVLICH: Martha McCallum joins us here at the table to talk 2020 and tell us about her fantastic new book, Unknown Valor: A Story of Family Courage and Sacrifice from Pearl Harbor to Iwo Jima. Thank you, Martha, for being here. But first, back to politics. Joe Biden is trying to revive his campaign by winning South Carolina. Gaffes like this probably aren't helping.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You're the one who sent Barack Obama the presidency, and I have a simple proposition here. I'm here to ask you for your help. Where I come from, you don't get far unless you ask. My name is Joe Biden, I'm the Democratic candidate for the United States Senate. Look me over. If you're like what you see, help out, if not vote but give me a look though, OK.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: So, you can see where -- you know, like when Amy Klobuchar was asked who's the president of Mexico and she couldn't think of it. I think these guys are tired. They're out there, they're -- it's a lot of energy and you can -- you can have a flub. One thing I would say about what's happening with Joe Biden is just look at that picture. Like, where are the advanced people? Where is the beautiful shot? Where is -- where do you have the thing that says, oh, he looks like he could be president.  WATTERS: He looks like he was in a kitchen.  PERINO: He looks like a student council election.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Those are physiological gaffes. Those aren't like I don't know -- I don't know the president of Mexico because I should have looked it up. Those are physiological, biological issues that we've seen from the beginning, and he -- it is a crime that people aren't getting him off the - -  PERINO: And helping him.  GUTFELD: And helping him.  MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANCHOR: I mean, it's like Brit Hume said -- he said, you know, I know what that is. He said, because I'm also getting older, and I understand what that is. And that's what that is. It almost reminded me of when he said, you know, the kids are upstairs listening to their record players, because when I look at him saying that I picture like an eight-track tape being pushed in, that sounds like 2000 or whatever, from the Senate race, because it keeps going and repeating the exact all the lines that went along with it at that time.  WILLIAMS: I just think it's incredible. You guys go after him for having these gaffes. And I think who's the gaffe master?  GUTFELD: Juan, you're absolutely wrong. I've been here from the beginning talking about concern about him. It's called concern.  WILLIAMS: No, no, no. Let me just tell you. I've known --  GUTFELD: Well, you're wrong, Juan. You're dead wrong.  WILLIAMS: I know -- I know Joe Biden. Joe Biden has been making flubs for years and they keep electing them.  GUTFELD: You understand that that is not a physiological issue.  WILLIAMS: But with Donald Trump, Donald Trump does things that you think that guy's ego is unleashed. He has no sense --  GUTFELD: That is not a sign of mental decline, Juan. But maybe you wouldn't notice that.  PAVLICH: Jesse, quick word on Biden, and then I want to get to Martha's book.  WATTERS: OK, a quick word on Biden.  PAVLICH: Real quick.  WATTERS: I'll let her plug the book.  PAVLICH: Tell us about your book, please, Unknown Valor.  MACCALLUM: All right. So it's called Unknown Valor: A Story of Family, Courage, and Sacrifice from Pearl Harbor to Iwo Jima. And it's based on letters that were written to my grandfather and my mom by Harry Gray who was their first cousin and nephew. And he was 18 years old when he went to Iwo Jima.  He wrote these beautiful letters as so many young people did then. There was a real art to letter writing and I've cherished these letters my whole life. And I started working with them and digging into the people who also wrote letters about him after he was killed, and finding those people and one thing led to another and all these storylines came together in a history of Pearl Harbor to Iwo Jima on the homefront and also moving as it moves through the Pacific.  WILLIAMS: Do you know what struck me? When you were talking about this was that people who knew him, you discovered them, and say, did you know this guy?  MACCALLUM: Yes. I found two and I never thought that this would happen when I started writing this book. I thought most of these people were gone. They're all in their 90s. One of them is 101. I spoke with him on his 101st birthday the other day, and the other one is 94 and living in Florida. And I found these people and I called them and I said, George -- because I had letters from George Coburn that he had written, and I realized late in the game of writing.  I tried to find him but couldn't find him that he was actually still alive. And I called him and I said, I'm Harry Craig's nice, and he just went silent. And then he said, I think about Harry all the time.  PERINO: Would you -- and those things are so amazing, and the documentary that Fox did is great, but I wonder maybe you could tell the story about how your -- it was your grandfather, right, that did the map room down in the basement with all the news clippings, and he would -- he would see where he was going.  MACCALLUM: I mean, that's where I became interested in World War Two. When I was a little kid, I used to go up to their attic and he had all the headlines from important days in the war saved. And he would pull the maps out from behind and put them up over his workbench and kind of move the pins across. The map as the Nazi invasion was moving across Europe. So he was always very interested in history, and it sparked my interest in it. And, you know, he was a well-read person and really wonderful.  WATTERS: What did you learn about your family that you didn't know before?  MACCALLUM: You know, I mean, I spent a lot of time with my aunt Nancy, who's alive. She's 89 years old, and she was Harry's sister. And I went up and sat with her and interviewed her. That was the very first thing I did when I started writing the book. And just all these stories poured out about really how difficult their life was.  They lost their father when he was -- when he was 12 and Nancy was eight. And their mother who I was very close to, my aunt Anne, raised them. And you know, these are people who never complained about anything. They just charge forward. She didn't have any handouts. He wasn't eligible for Social Security because he'd only worked in this company for a couple of years, and she went back to work.  And you know, they found a way to make it work. And Harry, when he was in the battle, he never complained. He'd say, there's you know, mortars flying over my head, but the chow was pretty good and I'm trying to eat a lot of it, you know, because they didn't want people to worry at home.  WATTERS: What would they be doing in this sceneries? I can't get cell service.  MACCALLUM: Yes, right. Yes, yes.  PERINO: Well, Martha, thank you so much for sharing the story. We look forward to reading the book Unknown Valor. The ""FASTEST SEVEN"" is up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: Welcome back. Time for the ""FASTEST SEVEN."" Yes, it's my turn. First up, if you're going to do a serious news report on Facebook Live, it's best to turn off the filters first.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's just a good reminder that's being really the first significant snow that we've had to be safe if you do have to go somewhere on the roads and make sure you're giving yourself plenty of time to get there, and plenty of space with the car that is in front of you.  Wait, Misty, did I have a weird face? There's special effects on the phone. Well, we weren't trying to --  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: You know, Jesse, these are the kind of mistakes you want to make as a reporter. If you had to choose --  WATTERS: Yes, that would be a great gaffe for me. I think Joe Biden should try this. These are the kind of humanizing gaffes that Joe Biden could really use on the trail.  GUTFELD: Yes.  WATTERS: And Greg, where's the monologue?  GUTFELD: I had -- I had a busy morning.  WATTERS: People are texting me. They said, where's the monologue? I don't want to watch the ""FASTEST"" I want to watch the monologue.  PERINO: I like ""FASTEST SEVEN."" I mean, I like the monologue too, but I always like ""FASTEST SEVEN."" I think that they did that on purpose.  GUTFELD: Same here. I think this is fake news.  PERINO: Everybody is talking about him.  GUTFELD: Yes, exactly. See, Juan, what do you think? Do you think he did this on purpose?  WILLIAMS: No, I think he screwed up, but it was funny. Yes, yes. Katie?  PAVLICH: I think he did it on purpose because you can see yourself in the phone with that on your face.  WILLIAMS: Yes, but you already -- once you start, it's over.  PAVLICH: I think they -- all the news reports from local news on weather should be done with a face.  PERINO: It's very cute. It's fine. It's great.  WATTERS: Yes, that's a good idea.  GUTFELD: We should -- you know what, the entire FIVE should be done with that way.  PERINO: I'm doing it next time to you when we do Facebook Live.  GUTFELD: Excellent.  WATTERS: Let's do it.  GUTFELD: All right, next up, eight years after her tragic death. It's been eight years. Whitney Houston is set to tour again, as a hologram. The tour starts today in Europe and U.S. dates are expected to be added, Katie. This is -- don't we hear this story -- was it going to be Michael Jackson, then it was going to be Prince. Is this real or is it -- is the story a hologram?  PAVLICH: More like the modern version of the ghost.  GUTFELD: Yes.  PAVLICH: I'm not into it. I think it's kind of weird. Just moving on.  WILLIAMS: I saw -- I saw the --  PAVLICH: But for fans, it's great. Did you see hologram show? Was it weird?  WILLIAMS: I saw Michael Jackson in Vegas and it was great. It was terrific.  PAVLICH: Did it look real?  WILLIAMS: Yes. It's unbelievable.  PAVLICH: Did you feel the presence?  GUTFELD: I'm going to have to ask. Who gets the money?  PAVLICH: They should do Elvis now.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: But you know, having just been to Disney, you see these characters that are brought to life. And of course, they're not human, they're machines. It's fabulous. I mean, I think hey, how come somebody didn't get the job to you know, perform that act? But at the same time, it's pretty amazing.  GUTFELD: Do you think they'll have a hologram for THE FIVE when we're gone?  WATTERS: We're gone right now. Juan, you're such a sucker. You paid money for a hologram?  WILLIAMS: Yes.  WATTERS: I mean, Jesus.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: In fact, you know what was great about it? The dancers are there and before you realize it, you think, that looks like Michael Jackson. It is -- it is the hologram with --  PAVLICH: So it's real people with the hologram.  WATTERS: The only way I'm paying for this if they project the hologram into my home. I'm not going to somewhere else.  GUTFELD: There you go. Exactly. And then God forbid what you think about doing. Dana?  PERINO: I think this is a good idea for you and Tom Shillue when you go on your thing -- on your -- on your little weekend things when you do like the big --  GUTFELD: My little weekend?  WATTERS: Your little weekend things? Oh, you mean his national tour?  PERINO: Yes, the national tour. But then because you don't like to travel so you'd never have to leave your apartment.  GUTFELD: There you go. Well, you can have meetings. I could be a hologram here. I could be home in my bathrobe right now.  PAVLICH: But you're live. That's different.  GUTFELD: A study -- I actually liked this one topic -- finds that the average person wastes almost 22 hours every week. The biggest time suck is spending four hours on escaping mental health breaks like watching YouTube videos or checking social media. You' know what I don't like about the story, Dana, is that they quantify -- they quantified waste using quantities of marathons like 21 hours of time. You could have -- you could have ran five marathons. It's like well, if you ran five marathons, that's a waste of 21 hours.  WATTERS: And also, you blow up your knees. So like, what's the benefit of that?  GUTFELD: Yes. Who are these people?  PERINO: And also, here's the thing. Everyone gets a personal choice and isn't America great?  GUTFELD: Yes, exactly. And Juan, why do they think watching YouTube videos is a waste of time? You could be learning things.  WILLIAMS: You could be. And also it's you know, somebody else's relaxing so they can do a better job when they focus again.  GUTFELD: Yes.  WILLIAMS: You know, so it's up -- but I will say the fear of the employer, and it's like, you know, people are off their bedding or they're watching frivolous, you might think, hey, what are you doing? But you know what, I think again, people find different ways to relax in the course of the day. This was an extremely high number. It made me wonder.  PAVLICH: Apple has this new thing now and they tell you what your screen time is, and it's like social media, blah, blah, blah. I don't really need to know. Thank you.  GUTFELD: Yes, but they tell if you went down this week or you went up.  PAVLICH: Yes. And it's like, but why? What am I doing?  GUTFELD: Yes, what am I doing differently?  PAVLICH: Either way.  GUTFELD: It's freaking me out, Jesse.  WATTERS: You know what the biggest time suck is?  GUTFELD: What?  WATTERS: Covering studies on THE FIVE. Every facet is a study.  GUTFELD: You know what's funny? When I do the ""FASTEST,"" you turned into me and complain about the FASTEST.  WATTERS: I do. That just happens. That just happens.  GUTFELD: Yes, you did. You're actually just trashed -- passes the way I do to you.  WATTERS: I did. I did.  PERINO: I love the ""FASTEST.""  GUTFELD: All right, you already said that. What do you want me to do, cry?  PERINO: I'm a hologram.  GUTFELD: ""ONE MORE THING"" is up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WATTERS: Time now for ""ONE MORE THING."" Dana?  PERINO: All right, so this afternoon, right before the daily briefing, I had the privilege to meet with a group of young people that were very impressive. This is called the animation project. It's a nonprofit animation program. It's led by industry pros who also provide mentoring to young adults in New York City. It's called Tap.  And the students came to Fox today and they shadowed members of our team and sat for presentations about the industry and got to the doodle hands-on stuff. And it helps bring animation and storytelling vehicles to New York City communities and kids who may not have the opportunity otherwise.  And I was super impressed with them. They will learn technical knowledge through this program but they also talked to them about building their confidence and telling them that they have exceedingly bright futures, you just got to make some good choices.  WATTERS: Nice group of kids.  WILLIAMS: Any holograms?  PERINO: No holograms.  PAVLICH: They can make them though.  WATTERS: Juan?  WILLIAMS: All right, so Today is February 25th. It's a major cultural and sports anniversary. On this day, in 1964, 22-year-old -- isn't that great-- Cassius Clay later known as Muhammad Ali shocked the world. He beat eight to one odds to defeat Sonny Liston to become the World Heavyweight Champion. Take a look at this.  As you can see, Ali battered listen with quick powerful jabs. Liston didn't come out for the seventh round. Ali started boxing at 12. By the time he was 18, he'd won 100 amateur bouts. In 1960, he won the gold medal at the Olympics in boxing. After he defeated Liston, Ali pointed at the media and famously said I am the greatest. Don't have a mark my face and I beat Sonny Liston.  By the way, as I mentioned last week, you can watch a special HBO documentary film, Ali and Cavett. It's about Ali and the talk show host. I'm a featured commentator in that HBO documentary.  WATTERS: That's what you do in the green room after every show, Juan. I am the greatest.  WILLIAMS: No. I try to heal the wounds, Jesse. That's what I -- that's my job.  WATTERS: All right, we have a thoughtful Valentine's Day gift news. All right, buckle in everybody. Best way to tell your wife that you love her, not with chocolates, not with flowers, not with soft cuddly teddy bears, it is with a custom coffee mug with my face on it. That is right.  Shout out to Jamie Gragg from Crisfield, Maryland who gave his wife Amy this handsome mug. Get it, Greg? This handsome mug on Valentine's Day. They're fans of THE FIVE. They never miss a show. So everybody just enjoy.  PERINO: Pun intended. You should do -- a mug of Jasper I think. That's a good gift.  WATTERS: Oh, no. Only a mug of me --  GUTFELD: Yes.  WATTERS: Will bring a couple together.  PERINO: With a smirk.  WATTERS: That's right. Greg?  GUTFELD: Put a rose in it. All right, let's do this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Robots are great. Robots are great. Robots are great.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: I want to remind everybody that once robots reach superintelligence, they will have a memory and remember everything you do to them. So keep that in mind especially Boston Dynamics who decided to make a rickshaw -- can you say rickshaw or is it a petty cab? Using their robot dog spotmini.  Now, look at this. So they got -- the spotmini is pulling this human. So maybe 50 years from now, maybe 100 years, when spot mini reaches superintelligence, smarter 20 times, 30 times, he's going to remember this guy, he's going to bite -- he's going to rip him from limb to limb.  PERINO: No, he's going to make the human pull him around.  GUTFELD: Yes. Well no, first he'll grind him to a fine pulp. That's what he'll do. And that's why robots are great.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Robots are great. Robots are great. Robots are great.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: It would be a pedicab if the robot was peddling.  GUTFELD: Yes, that's it. I got Rick -- I don't know what that word means, so I don't know.  WATTERS: You're so sensitive.  WILLIAMS: That's our man, Mr. Sensitivity.  PERINO: OK, so last week I was traveling with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo through Africa in the Middle East covering his trip. And he visited the Prince Sultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia where many of our troops were -- have been recently stationed and deployed to combat Iran. There he is having lunch with many of them there. And they have new F-15 fighter jets as well that we saw on tour. You can't see him but he's underneath there.  And then I also landed an interview with the Secretary which you can check out@townhall.com. We talked about China, the Iranian threat, Huawei and a number of issues going on with Africa that Americans probably should pay attention to. And from my last photo, the question is, is that a real lion or a fake lion? You get to decide.  GUTFELD: Are you lying about the lion?  PERINO: So, it's a great trip. Really interesting.  WATTERS: I think it's -- I think it's fake. I'm going to go with fake.  WILLIAMS: I think, congratulations.  WATTERS: All right.  PERINO: I think it's real.  WATTERS: Set your DVRs. Never miss an episode of THE FIVE. ""SPECIAL REPORT"", up next.  Hey Bret.  Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

68,FOX,"Sanders defends Fidel Castro's communist Cuba. Over the weekend, we had the 40th anniversary of the greatest sports upset, when the American Olympic team beat the Russians in hockey. The Red Army’s team had won the previous four gold medals. The last time the U.S. team won gold was 1960. As a kid, you can remember sitting in front of a TV, transfixed, witnessing history. For me, it was my first complete hockey game. BERNIE SANDERS' DEFENSE OF CASTRO'S CUBA EVOKES SOCIALISM'S BRUTAL HISTORY You have to wonder where Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was back then and who was he rooting for. Here’s one quote from Bernie during the 1980s: ""It’s funny, sometimes American journalists talk about how bad a country is, that people are lining up for food. That is a good thing! In other countries, people don’t line up for food. The rich get the food and the poor starve to death."" Sure, that was a long time ago. But you might consider how Soviet citizens felt when they heard a free person, in a free country, papering over their misery, doing publicity for their dictator. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Has Bernie changed much? Has he learned not to minimize the tragedies of totalitarianism? “We’re very opposed to the authoritarian nature of Cuba,” Sanders said in an interview over the weekend. “But, you know, it’s unfair to simply say everything is bad. You know? When Fidel Castro came into office, you know what he did? He had a massive literacy program. Is that a bad thing? Even though Fidel Castro did it?” Ah yes, the literacy program, the old joke the left always waves when you bring up the ravages of communism. “But everyone can read!” And, Ted Bundy was a great dancer, and Charles Manson played decent guitar. I'll give Bernie this: Admitting Castro did bad things is progress. Or, a concession to the obvious. As Bernie storms toward the Democratic nomination, remember history — the good and the bad — and remember which side Bernie chose. Murderous tyrants. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Is that a bad thing? Even though a leading Democrat did it? The answer? Damn straight it’s bad. Bernie is in his eighth decade. He's had a long adult life to reconsider, and he still can’t get it straight. Adapted from Greg Gutfeld’s monologue on “The Five” on Feb. 24, 2020. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM GREG GUTFELD"
69,FOX,"Trump turns up the heat on 2020 rivals as he fires up supporters in Las Vegas; reaction on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" February 21, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: I got it. And I know you'll be all over it tomorrow as well, with the Nevada caucuses tomorrow 10 a.m. to noon Eastern Time. Looking at what happens there and whether it carries over anywhere. Here comes ""The Five.""  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello everybody. I'm Jesse Watters along with Tammy Bruce, Geraldo Rivera, Dagen McDowell, and Greg Gutfeld. How is he doing?  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: I don't know.  WATTERS: It's five o'clock in New York City. This is The Five.  The Trump train keeps rolling through western states this week. The president wrapping up another massive rally just a few minutes ago in Las Vegas. Trump on his game mocking the Democrats ahead of the Nevada caucuses tomorrow. Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Pocahontas was really mean, but she is going to be easy. I hope it's her. It's not going to be her. She made a little comeback the other night because she took mini Mike to the critters. But it's not going to be her.  It can't be Buttigieg, it can't be. I don't know. Alfred E. Neuman. Ladies and gentlemen, introducing President Alfred E. Neuman. Bernie is too emotional. He is creaming on crazy. And Biden is angry. Biden is angry, everything is anger. Gee. And that's what happens when you can't get the words out, no it does.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: And Trump saving his best for mini Michael Bloomberg.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: We got a new one, mini Mike, how did he do in the debate the other day? Mini Mike. Here's a box, Mike. Here Mike. Mini Mike so far has spent almost $500 million in order to get embarrassed by Pocahontas. She's mean. Right? Right? See that faces just wanted to get him, she said I got him, I want to see those agreements. You open up those agreements.  This poor guy probably signed 100 of them, and each one is a disaster. He said I don't want to open those agreements. Nobody told me this was going to happen. Instead he said, nobody told me.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: All right. Greg and I were trying to get some work done in the pod this afternoon, and we just heard the speech outside and we both gather around to start watching it, he was, he's on his game.  GUTFELD: It's pretty magnetic. Do you know what -- the most interesting thing about the thing today was that he decided to break through the fourth wall and he told everybody it was a show, and he was talking about, talking about being with Mark Burnett and this cast of characters, and this is better than ""The Apprentice"" meeting survivor.  This was the first time, I think, that he referred to his presidency as a show. And for people who are used to being critical of Trump who are no longer critical, are the people that can discern the difference between the job and the show.  The things that he is doing, which are incredibly positive and effective with the economy and jobs and prosperity and peace, the separate -- to separate the craziness of this gives you a healthy peace of mind that never-Trumpers can't do. And it makes you think, what's going to -- what's the second term Trump look like? You're going to have, it's going to be more theatrical, more set locations, more guest stars and road trips?  Because that's what happens when a TV series gets renewed, it's not a reelection, it's the renewal of a TV show and there're going to be more stuff after the debate.  You saw a sense of the Democrats realization that this wasn't locked, impulsiveness, or Russian bots that elected him. That this is a unique skill set that only he possesses and that they can't be. It's an interesting, it's an interesting transformation that you're seeing in the last couple of weeks.  WATTERS: Yes. And the fact that you and I can tell the difference --  GUTFELD: Yes.  WATTERS: -- between the truth and the entertainment side is easy, because, you know, we watched this for a living and we don't take this part that seriously. We just, it's enjoyable to see. But the media, they fact-check his jokes, like they don't get that this is partially entertainment.  DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Because they have zero sense of humor, and they can't, they can't detect what is funny. His jokes land and are funny because they are true, he has that ability to pick off all these candidates.  I use this test growing up down south of all of those Democrats that were on the stage the other night. Which one what I had from at the food lion? Which one would I stand in front of the frozen food case and get frostbite on my nose so I didn't have to talk to one of them?  GUTFELD: What a visual.  MCDOWELL: Because the truth, and it's like, let me know when they are in the parking lot already, because Bernie is going to be upset about, you know, food inflation, his bananas cost more money. Elizabeth Warren is going to lecture me about biting my fingernails. Maybe Pete Buttigieg I'd want talk to, but he doesn't have enough experience to run the food lion.  WATTERS: Geraldo, you know, Greg talks about the casting of this, and the president mentioned that. The president is not responsible for casting the Democratic field, he is just lucky that these people are running against him.  GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT-AT-LARGE: It wouldn't matter who it was, though, Jesse. He finds the weak spot wherever he is, he is a great fighter. He knows. And he's also, he's such an oversized personality that he blocks out the sun. Everybody else seems like mini somebody or other. He lets no insult go un-responded to.  He's got a flamethrower. You give him one shot, man, he's going to scorch you. And I think that, you know, and he also has the charisma there, it's unmistakable. It is the charisma though, of the bully. You know, it's the - - you know, I use the expression Godzilla. He comes in, OK, you hit me. Whoa, I'm going to kill you.  And you know, he is a scary adversary but he is also such a magnetic personality that he rates. And he is right when he says that bad for him CNN would be out of business, the New York Times would be a failing newspaper. The Washington Post would be trying to sell copies of --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: Yes. And I think we have some of that sound. Let's listen in and Tammy can respond.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: Eventually the Times and the Washington Post which will be dead as a doornail after I leave, and the CNN it will be an obsolete business of the cable business. MSDNC will be out of business, it's the Titanic equivalent went down they wouldn't cover it unless I was on the sucker. It's true.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: I mean, that is true, it's everything Trump right now.  TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: It's true. It's true. And the entire thing is caricatures about people, right? There's all elements of truth. It's a picture you get at Disneyland, where it kind of looks like you, it's just like certain things are exaggerated. Right?  But it's absolutely true. And what's great about this guy is this is the same guy that everybody got to meet in 2015. He hasn't changed, they haven't ruined him, he didn't get scared, he didn't address, that's the other thing they love about him.  It's that, this in fact, while it is perhaps performance, it's really him as well. Just like him governing his performance in a sense but that's him too. And Americans can relate to him, that's what everyone is thinking but it's also because it is consistent. That this is, you know, sometimes he might irritate you or might not agree, but there he is, he is the same guy.  And you do know that it's a joke. The only people who don't of course are the Democrats and they are, they become in an effort to be like Trump revealing their ultimate weakness which is their lack of confidence in themselves.  They want to be like someone else, that has been the ultimate fraud. Right? It's what the Democrats and the establishment has always done is present these kinds of figures to you of who they are, whether it's the Obama's or even the Bush's or the Clintons, or anyone else. This is brand-new and it is real, and that's what they can't stand and they can't replicate it. It's true.  WATTERS: Well, and he gets on air and literally the day after they have these debates, and he just repackages the Democrats brand for them --  BRUCE: Yes.  WATTERS: -- and it's just always right there immediately to respond. So he gets his imprint on it.  All right. Coming up, Trump hitting back after the media revs up Russia hysteria 2.0. And, we just found out Putin may be trying to help Bernie.  RIVERA: Why doesn't he help me?  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  MCDOWELL: Russia hysteria it's back after a New York Times report claims intelligence officials are warning Congress that Putin is trying to get Trump re-elected. Democrats and the media are back to accusing Trump of treason.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, MSNBC HOST: This is one of those shocking news days, if you retain the capacity to be shocked.  JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC HOST: The Russians are coming.  MIKA BRZEZINSKI, MSNBC HOST: Yes, they are.  SCARBOROUGH: And they are coming again for their main man Donald J. Trump.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Russians are up and again.  CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC HOST: Right.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Up to it.  MATTHEWS: Right.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The president is at suppressing the information.  (CROSSTALK)  MATTHEWS: OK. Thank you.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think frankly, the president welcomes it, he wants it.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It would be bad enough to learn that the Russians are back at it helping Trump. It's much worse that Trump appears to be trying to cover that up.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What you mean they are back? They never left.  O'DONNELL: The president is a Russian operative.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  MCDOWELL: Wow. So, the president fired back at the new Russia hysteria, or the new old Russia hysteria --  GUTFELD: Yes.  MCDOWELL: -- during his rally.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: They said today that Putin wants to be sure that Trump gets elected, here we go again. I was told the week ago they said, you know, they're trying to start a rumor, it's disinformation. That's the only thing they're good at. They're not good at anything else. They get nothing done, do-nothing Democrats.  That Putin wants to make sure I get elected. Listen to this. So, doesn't he want to see who the Democrat is going to be? Wouldn't he rather have let's say Bernie, wouldn't he rather have Bernie who honeymooned in Moscow. Wouldn't that be? Wouldn't that be? These people are crazy. That's all they think about.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  MCDOWELL: Well, and as it turns out, a breaking new report says Bernie Sanders has been briefed by U.S. officials that Russia is trying to help his presidential campaign. Greg?  GUTFELD: Yes. Geez. I love this. By the way, can you be my mica? Just after I say something just go, yes, absolutely, you're right. Just do that. Do the nod.  DOWELL: Yes.  GUTFELD: Too bad they didn't take the camera angle, but it's OK.  DOWELL: Yes.  GUTFELD: You know what Russia is for the Dems? It's a bottle of booze that they hide in case something runs out. They look at what happened with impeachment. They look at the collusion and the obstruction. The Dems have stepped on more rakes than a blind gardener.  And this thing, all they have left now, especially after the debate, it's this, it's the Russian collusion, the Russian obstruction, what is the hard info on this by the way? Like, what are they talking about? Are they talking about box? What exactly is this? And who leaks this? Do you know?  WATTERS: Schiff leaks it.  GUTFELD: Yes.  WATTERS: They briefed the House Intel committee --  GUTFELD: Are you sure?  WATTERS: -- and he leaked like Schiff. Did I just see you say that they warned Bernie? OK. So, they didn't try to wiretap Bernie, they actually want him.  MCDOWELL: No.  WATTERS: And since --  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: Good point. Good point.  WATTERS: -- (Inaudible) who was in campaign, they actually warned him. OK. I see what the difference is, permission to make a sexual analogy.  GUTFELD: No. OK, fine.  WATTERS: Permission to make an analogy.  GUTFELD: Yes.  WATTERS: Fine. All right. This is like Smollett faking another hate crime hoax --  GUTFELD: Yes.  WATTERS: -- and expect everybody to believe it.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: That's a great analogy. Jussie Smollett.  WATTERS: Except instead of subways he goes out for McDonald's. Right? It's like the same thing over and over and over again, we're sick of it. Losers I can see making an excuse after you lose, but now they are making excuses before they lost and that's pathetic.  A Gallup poll says that only 1 percent of Americans care about election integrity, and 0.5 percent of Americans are concerned about the Russians. Yet 75 percent of all news coverage are about the Russians and elections.  RIVERA: Russia, Russia, Russia. This is the tragedy of impeachment, by taking things like the dossier, the Russian dossier and making that sufficient to impeach a president of the United States for only the third time in 243 years, they have destroyed the credibility of the intelligence agencies, you don't believe them, it is partisan from the get-go. Russia, Russia, Russia.  First of all, if you are accused of Russia, Russia, Russia, how do you prove that you're not a Russian bot? How do you --how do you disprove the allegation? You know, it's so classic, it's so -- it's slander. It's like - - it's like the black hole from the old days.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: Carter Page said he was clean and they still lied about it.  RIVERA: I think that for intelligence agencies right now to make a charge like that, I want to see what the proof is. Everybody should see what the proof is. And once you engage somebody like Adam Schiff and something like the House intelligence committee, that they have reporters on speed dial immediately.  MCDOWELL: Right.  RIVERA: I got the leak, somebody says this. OK, New York Times, OK, Washington Post. OK --  WATTERS: Catherine Herridge says they ask these briefers do they have signal intelligence --  BRUCE: Yes.  WATTERS: -- they have phone intercepts.  BRUCE: Yes.  WATTERS: Do you have anything? And the briefer said no.  BRUCE: Yes.  MCDOWELL: Well, they've demanded the underlying intelligence were heard in the Republicans on the committee. But do these liberal (INAUDIBLE), these makeup wearing mouthpieces --  BRUCE: Yes.  MCDOWELL: -- realize that they are part of the apparatchik? They are -- they are spreading disinformation straight from Putin by doing this.  BRUCE: But here is the bigger problem. By doing this they are reminding the electorate and the viewers of the failure from before. They are bringing it all back which is something they should want to avoid, because we all then go back to the Russia hoax, the dossier, the failed impeachment, the field Mueller stuff. All the negatives.  Trump's approval numbers are now the highest they've been, the highest according to Gallup so with independents, that we've been the highest now and the U.S. satisfaction about the state of the U.S., it's the highest since 2005.  All of these numbers move when there is ae realization that this was a hoax, and now they are bringing it back. This is the ultimate, and by the way, I have to say about those -- that CBS report. They asked specifically for intelligence on this. And specifically, they were told there was none.  So, this is a repeat of this. It's like, well, I'll do analogy of myself up here. You are in a car, it only goes forward, you are at the cliff, they keep getting in the car and turning it on, they keep moving forward. And they don't know what to do. They don't know how to stop it but they don't care they'll just keep going.  MCDOWELL: Well, Hillary Clinton knows what to do, not shut up. Here is what she said today on Twitter. ""Putin's puppet is at it again.""  BRUCE: Yes, yes.  MCDOWELL: ""Taking Russian help for himself. He knows he can't win without it. And we can't let it happen.""  BRUCE: Does any to --  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: I wonder if they believe it. I was watching Brian Williams last night. I couldn't sleep at home after Hannity. I couldn't sleep. Right. I put on Brian Williams and he's there with good reporters. That's the reason I (Inaudible) from the Washington Post, and from the New York Times, the best guy in the New York Times, I think.  WATTERS: Schmidt?  RIVERA: No.  WATTERS: Steve?  RIVERA: No.  WATTERS: Harry.  RIVERA: No.  WATTERS: Janice.  RIVERA: No. It will come --  WATTERS: Beverly.  RIVERA: The chief White House correspondent Peter Baker.  WATTERS: Baker.  RIVERA: And so, I'm watching him.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Let me get that, Geraldo.  RIVERA: I wonder, I wonder if they -- those reporters, though, he's Brian Williams, he's big, he's big. Lawrence O'Donnell, the huge, it's awful, the world is ending. Russia, Russia, Russia.  Yet to the two reporters they say well, you know, it's interesting, maybe there is something there.  (CROSSTALK)  BRUCE: They don't believe it. They don't believe it. Nobody believes it.  RIVERA: The reporters they -- the reporters discounted it, but it seemed to me that the anchors, I wonder if they -- if you gave them a lie detector test would they believe it themselves?  BRUCE: No.  RIVERA: That Russia has infiltrated. That Russia is going to sway --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: Well, it's Russia. Their ratings are down, and they need to plug these bombshells because that's all they have. And you can't cover the Democrats, look at them, they are a mess. That's not going to rate, no one wants to watch what happened.  RIVERA: Well, they rated, it rated when Bloomberg stepped up because he has --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: Yes, but now that Bloomberg is toast. They don't have any hope left.  RIVERA: -- there's a real man.  BRUCE: Now they want to --  RIVERA: Now I think it's going to fade.  BRUCE: You've all noted this to some degrees, that they want to now explain their failure in November. They are preparing now for the excuse.  WATTERS: Right.  BRUCE: And this is why people have to pay attention because you are going to get four more years of this garbage if you don't vote accordingly. It's just crazy time.  (CROSSTALK)  MCDOWELL: I always think they are trying to set Trump up, though, too. So, they are trying to make -- get him to make a mistake.  GUTFELD: I don't know. You know what it is, is that the day comes when there is a threat it will still be a punch line. Because they've turned a threat, a potential threat, a hypothetical threat into a joke. You can't help.  Now when you hear about this, it's funny. It's not serious.  MCDOWELL: Yes.  GUTFELD: So, what they have done is they've actually undermined the security of the United States by crying wolf for four years.  MCDOWELL: Yes.  RIVERA: Well, that's a big, big charge.  GUTFELD: It is, Geraldo. And I stand behind it.  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: I don't know if I go -- I don't know if I go quite that far.  GUTFELD: I stand behind it, and so does Peter Baker from the New York Times.  RIVERA: Peter, I'm sorry.  MCDOWELL: Seen. Next up, Hollywood is furious after being called out by President Trump.  GUTFELD: Are they serious -- are they --  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: Just too bad.  BRUCE: At issuance.  RIVERA: Hollywood's liberal majority is still not happy with President Trump, what a big news flash, especially after the shot he took at ""Parasite"" the South Korean flick that won best picture at this year's Academy Awards.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: You know, they said, ladies and gentlemen, the winner of the Academy Award is a movie made in South Korea. I said what's this all about? Bring back ""Gone with the Wind."" And some of them wrote he doesn't know that that movie like in 1936.  But now anybody sitting there reading this thing, man, Trump can't be that smart, you know, he said bring back ""Gone with the Wind."" That's an old movie. Yes, it's an old classic, bring back make -- what I say is, make great movies.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  RIVERA: ""Casablanca"" is a classic, ""Godfather"" is a classic, ""Citizen Kane"" a classic. ""Gone with the Wind"" is a classic. But when it comes to ""Parasite,"" their studio is firing back at the president. They're claiming that POTUS is mad because he, quote, ""can't read the movie subtitles"" which is a pretty good line.  The president did not comment on the controversy when he mentioned that his favorite was ""Gone with the Wind."" I mean, 1939 some considered racist. I mean, in today's point of view for its depiction n of slavery in the old south, what do you think?  MCDOWELL: Has anything ever been more telling than what he wants ""Gone with the Wind"" back?  RIVERA: Look, there's a lot to that.  MCDOWELL: I know that.  RIVERA: OK.  MCDOWELL: I mean --  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: ""Gone with the Wind"" is not exactly the most woke movie in the world.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let's get ""Birth of a Nation"" back up in there because --  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- we'll have enough of that kind of kowtowing and --  ANA NAVARRO, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Why don't we bring ""Mame"" with the handkerchief on her head?  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.  NAVARRO Let's bring back the Civil War. Let's bring back slaves.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well --  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But ""Gone with the Wind"" is about subordinating black with white --  (END VIDEO CLIP)  RIVERA: You know, Greg, it's one thing to make fun of mini Mike and that cast of characters, but why ""Gone with the Wind?"" Why of all the movies ""Gone with the Wind?"" It reminds me in 2016, I was covering the South Carolina primary and David Duke's name came up. David Duke the famed, you know, racist cross burner, and the president saying, you know, knowledge about -- I don't know David Duke. Who is David Duke? It just seems that that's a dog whistle to the dark side of his base and they don't appreciate.  GUTFELD: I don't see -- I don't see any connection to what you just said to liking ""Gone with the Wind."" Because when you, when someone says they like that movie, it requires you to read their mind on what they like it.  What they are doing is they have -- they are absent of any facts. So, they say, he likes ""Gone with the Wind"" Racist -- they've been doing this for three years, they have been trying to read his mind.  By the way, he is the worst racist ever. With prison reform, with helping historically black college -- historically black colleges with jobs and wages. Anyway --  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: Blah, blah, blah.  GUTFELD: Yes, blah, blah, blah. Facts, Geraldo.  RIVERA: Blah, blah, blah. I mean, ""Gone with the Wind"".  GUTFELD: I mean, let me finish though. Let me finish. Well, you're the one that's saying that it's racist. So anyway.  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: Wait. ""Casablanca,"" ""Godfather,"" ""Citizen Kane"" --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: They're all racist, Geraldo. if you like --  RIVERA: label without a --  GUTFELD: ""Casablanca"" is obviously racist, Geraldo. But here, the bigger story here, there is a reversal of fortune going on with the left you see insert personal politics into your personal life. Right?  Trump has taken real life and inserted it into politics. So, finally, the turf of entertainment, academia, and media is finally being matched by Republican. That has never happened before. So, they don't care about ""Parasite,"" that's a nonstory. The story is there is somebody who's actually more entertaining than the entire Oscars, and his name is Trump.  RIVERA: That may true in terms of --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: It's true all around, Geraldo. It's just true.  RIVERA: What about ""Parasite,"" Dagen, did you like it?  MCDOWELL: I liked it. Now I think that President Trump is behind the wheel of the pickup for so many hours a week. You are going to drive the pickup into the ditch, so to speak. I hate ""Gone with the Wind.""  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: Once in a while.  MCDOWELL: I hate ""Gone with the Wind.""  RIVERA: Why do you hate it? I'm curious.  MCDOWELL: Because every movie about southerners nobody actually sounds like they're from the day on south.  RIVERA: Yes.  MCDOWELL: After all, tomorrow is another day.  RIVERA: What am I listening to right now?  MCDOWELL: Julia Roberts grew up in Georgia and she doesn't sound southern probably because she is ashamed of being from there. Shame on her. Like, mob colors (ph) are blush and mash roll from ""Steel Magnolias.""  He made a mistake. If he is going to rip on the Oscars, I want him to go after what was it, ""The Shape of Water"" where that woman had a relationship that --  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: That was pretty good.  MCDOWELL: -- aquatic sleestack (ph). Just go down the list, because most of the best picture picks in the last 30 years have just been ghastly.  RIVERA: Well --  (CROSSTALK)  MCDOWELL: It's old school, worse --  RIVERA: -- the have a latitude for that.  GUTFELD: Are like for --  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: Did you have a ""Mame,"" Jesse? Did you dig his ""Gone with the Wind"" references?  WATTERS: Did I have a ""Mame,"" Geraldo? It's really that what you're asking me? No, I did not have a ""Mame,"" Geraldo.  RIVERA: Good, good, good. So, what do you think?  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: So, what's the question?  RIVERA: The question is, don't you think that this is like -- it's a -- there's a lot of great movies, and if you -- even if you (INAUDIBLE) with the win, I know you say as you present your best picture pick from 1939, I know that it's not politically correct in today's values, but I still love the classic --  WATTERS: I will --I'll use -- I'll sure Greg's point against you because I don't think you heard him. He's such a bad racist that he said his favorite movie was Gone with the Wind. What if he said like Django Unchained or like Do the Right Thing? Are they going to call him racist then? I mean, no matter what he says they're going to spin it as negative.  TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Guys, and don't you think maybe that's part of his point, too. I mean, this is -- this is the conversation that look, the average American thinks Gone with the Wind. They think Vivien Leigh, and they're not thinking the politics.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: It's a romantic story.  BRUCE: But it also it's about, you know, the destruction of the south for a really good reason and that, you know, the insipidness of the dynamic of that and the South was destroyed which is why tomorrow had to be another day because this day was ruined for them.  WATTERS: Wait, wait, wait. If Trump is a racist, why would he like the South being destroyed?  BRUCE: You know, but that's --  WATTERS: Like that doesn't make sense.  BRUCE: But that's the conversation. That's the -- can you -- you've got to be able to say you've like Gone with the Wind because it's an -- it's an American movie and we're living our lives now. It's not woke, but it's from then.  RIVERA: Well, it's Hattie McDaniel -- Hattie -- the Best Supporting Actress. She won the --  BRUCE: She did.  RIVERA: African-American --  BRUCE: The Oscars ratings went up.  GUTFELD: In a racist film no less, Geraldo. You prove your point.  RIVERA: By 2020.  BRUCE: But look, he's also going after Hollywood because the Oscar ratings this year were down 31 percent in the demo 18 to 49.  RIVERA: Oh please. It is so boring, so boring.  BRUCE: 31 percent, it's a crash.  WATTERS: Because no one has seen Parasite.  BRUCE: Nobody cares. Nobody likes Hollywood.  RIVERA: And Brad Pitt definitely deserve the hit the President gave right there because Brad Pitt gave him a shot about impeachment. So like I said at the top of the show, you give it to Trump, he's going to give it back to you in spades.  MCDOWELL: I wanted -- I wanted the President to go after Brad Pitt basically divorcing two of the hottest women ever to walk in planet earth. If you're going to take shots, take the shot.  RIVERA: Don't go anywhere. The ""FASTEST SEVEN"" is up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  BRUCE: Alrighty, time for the ""FASTEST SEVEN."" First up, our tech addiction is physically changing the shape of our brains. MRI scans show smartphone addiction alters brains in a similar way to drug addicts. You know, I have to say that they don't necessarily show that -- they're not proven cause and effect, but they say that they see this.  WATTERS: Well, I tried to sniff my phone, I didn't get high. I don't know what the study is talking about. And while we're talking about studies, I'm sick of studies. They're never really that interesting. They never really showed me anything that I really didn't know.  RIVERA: Russia, Russia, Russia.  GUTFELD: We never act on it. So now we have this information that tech is changing our brains. And we're like, yes, sure, whatever. You know how many decades we had cars without seatbelts while tens of thousands of people died every year. We didn't do anything until like 1960.  BRUCE: And there was the same kind of concern, Dagen, when it was like a T.V. It's like T.V. is going to ruin you. You're going to be staring --  GUTFELD: They were right. Look at us.  BRUCE: Well, look at us. I mean, we're pretty fabulous.  WATTERS: Look at us, everybody.  BRUCE: Come on.  WATTERS: Keep watching.  MCDOWELL: I'm a T.V. addict, but at least with the phone, I might be addicted to it, but at least I'm moving around and I don't have a backside as wide as a truck.  RIVERA: But is it true that your brain is really being traceably altered by smartphones? I mean, I think that the Greg's office I think this is very, potentially -- I hate that my children are so into social media.  BRUCE: Maybe our brains are supposed to --  MCDOWELL: That's your fault as the dad, isn't it?  BRUCE: Maybe our brains are supposed to change. Come on. There's --  RIVERA: Maybe this is my fault.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Maybe this could be an evolutionary advancement. We should embrace the change.  WATTERS: Like global warming.  GUTFELD: Exactly.  WATTERS: Maybe we should be getting warmer.  RIVERA: We'll all be coneheads.  BRUCE: Learn how to swim farther and faster. All right, next up, Hollywood actor John Krasinski is not just known for his role in a T.V. show The Office, but for starring in movies like this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let's go. We got to move.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you and I don't get here soon --  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: None of you have to go.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  BRUCE: Wow. Now, Krasinski is firing back at critics who claim his roles promote, God forbid, Conservative politics, saying, ""when people look for something that they want to see, I can't stop them from a subjective belief in something. I have 11 aunts and uncles and cousins who've been in the military or still are in the military. So it was a big thing on my list to get to do a military movie or show or something.""  You know, Is it strange enough now, Greg, that the idea of being patriotic or being in the military has to be -- you have to be condemned or questioned about the fact that you might be right-winger? Isn't -- aren't liberals patriotic too? Don't they --  GUTFELD: Well, you know, it, it depends on where -- I mean, we talked about this in the previous block. In the entertainment industry, you're surrounded by people in the entertainment industry, so maybe they don't know enough people in the military. That could be it. But I'm sorry, whenever I see him, I just see Jim from the office. Like the office is on every single hour.  BRUCE: On the T.V.  GUTFELD: It's like I know more about Jim and Pam than I know about my own life. It's like when you were growing up, it was Gilligan's Island, and the Brady Bunch, Star Trek, Mannix. Now it's just the office, office, office.  RIVERA: You should be with my 14-year-old. She loves it. She watches the -- she thinks she's on her eighth run of the --  GUTFELD: It's one of the greatest shows ever but the British office.  RIVERA: And you know, in New York, there would be a vote outlaw the military. They would probably vote to outlaw the military. I mean, there are people in great swaths of this country who really feel, you know, that these G.I. films that --  BRUCE: Bigger swaths that are not on the coast love this stuff. Dagen, do you think he's -- he should have to defend himself in a certain way?  MCDOWELL: You defend yourself by taking a screenshot of your checking account balance.  BRUCE: There you go. That would do it. Like Jesse Watters, he should -- he could do it.  WATTERS: Yes.  MCDOWELL: He's going to do it right now.  WATTERS: Negative right now.  BRUCE: He's next to his smartphone checking his bank account.  WATTERS: I screenshotted that. Yes, my brain change so much.  BRUCE: All right, you guys, finally good news for those who love sleeping. People who nap regularly, they say, are more productive and happier than their non-napping counterparts.  RIVERA: I nap.  BRUCE: But that tells you everything. Jesse, you're -- look at that hair. I don't know how long --  WATTERS: This is bed head.  BRUCE: You could -- you could nap while it's being fixed.  WATTERS: Yes. You know, Greg has really wanted to talk about this segment the whole day so I'm going to cede my time to Greg.  BRUCE: I could tell.  GUTFELD: Yes, you know, I was -- I thought you know, instead of the woman playing the violin while getting brain surgery, which is the story of the day --  MCDOWELL: She was sort of napping.  GUTFELD: Let's talk -- she was. She was kind of napping. OK. You know what, Tom Shillue, I tour with him, has a really interesting habit. He drinks a double espresso and then goes to sleep immediately. Because in 20 minutes when he wakes up, the caffeine hits. So like he sleeps and then it just wakes up like an internal alarm clock. And he's like -- it's just -- he's not just a pretty face.  WATTERS: What a weirdo that guy is.  BRUCE: Dagen, are you a napper? What do you think?  MCDOWELL: I'm a spontaneous napper.  GUTFELD: Let's call doctor --  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: You mean you're not -- you mean, not out.  MCDOWELL: Of public transportations, subway --  WATTERS: So you can sleep on the subway?  MCDOWELL: Yes.  GUTFELD: Don't tell people that. You'll lose your purse  MCDOWELL: And you know what, they don't work because I'm just as fractious when I wake up.  BRUCE: So -- OK, so you're born upset, you were born awake?  MCDOWELL: Yes.  BRUCE: All right, there you go. 29 minutes, they say, is the optimum time for a nap.  MCDOWELL: No, seven hours, seven hours is the optimal time for a nap.  BRUCE: Alrighty. All right. Well, ""FAN MAIL FRIDAY"" coming up right when we get back.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: Yes, it's almost summertime, right? ""FAN MAIL FRIDAY,"" let's get started. Marian V. has this question. Kind of a good question, I think. What's the one thing in your closet that you know you should get rid of, but just can't. Jesse?  WATTERS: I have these cowboy boots that we got when we went to Nashville. They take up so much room in the closet.  GUTFELD: And you never get to wear them.  WATTERS: And I just -- they were expensive.  GUTFELD: Charity, give them away.  WATTERS: Fox paid for it but I still -- I feel like maybe for Halloween I should save them.  GUTFELD: I think you need to -- that should be a charity on THE FIVE that you give away to a viewer who writes in who needs -- what size are you?  WATTERS: It's a personal question.  GUTFELD: Oh, geez.  WATTERS: I'm 11, everybody.  GUTFELD: Tammy, what's in your closet?  BRUCE: A hat I wore to one of the Caribbean Islands when I was seeing if they could be as good as Hawaii. They can't be. And it's not a hat you can wear anywhere else and I'm not going back.  WATTERS: What kind of hat is it?  BRUCE: It's just you know, it's like a beach hat that's like a sun hat.  WATTERS: Like one of those big, round --  BRUCE: No, no, no. Not the smallest, not too gigantic, but it's sitting there. But we should sell these things on those Web sites, those apps. So you can sell something.  WATTERS: We should auction it.  GUTFELD: Geraldo?  RIVERA: My brother Craig and I were cleaning out my closet upstairs and there were two tuxedos in there that I swear have been in my closet for 10 years with big shoulder pads. You know, the big -- I don't know what they - -  GUTFELD: It's a trove of DNA.  RIVERA: And big -- that too. Big lapels, big shiny lapels.  GUTFELD: Yes, you could solve 13 crimes with Geraldo's tux. Dagen?  MCDOWELL: Leather shorts because my legs are -- yes, my legs are the color of aspirin kind of chalky. Nobody needs to see that.  GUTFELD: I'm sorry I left them there. I have --  RIVERA: You look great on those, Greg.  GUTFELD: I have a grenade.  RIVERA: These are for your acts.  GUTFELD: I have a hand grenade that is in a -- in a set like a sculpture that my wife wants me to get rid of. But I don't know how to throw away a hand grenade. You can't like -- I can't like put it in the garbage. So it's in my closet, a hand grenade. All right --  WATTERS: Still in the closet.  GUTFELD: Also the Tranxene is still there. What is your favorite -- Oh, this is fun.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Dean asked what is your favorite part of your career? I got to go to Geraldo first because there's like 30 parts.  RIVERA: Well, there are many, many parts. And now we're reviewing them all because this is my 50th anniversary on television, so we'll be celebrating that on Labor Day. The talk show days ahead of money tree growing in my backyard.  GUTFELD: You contributed to the decline of our culture.  RIVERA: I did not spend it.  GUTFELD: You got rich on cultural decline, Geraldo.  RIVERA: I did. I did. Celebrating --  GUTFELD: You are the reason why our streets are filled with filth.  RIVERA: Celebrating the decline of the Western civilization.  GUTFELD: Yes, exactly. He had GG Allin on his show.  MCDOWELL: I know.  GUTFELD: GG Allin.  MCDOWELL: You robbed my mind.  BRUCE: Oh my God.  GUTFELD: Yes, GG Allin and the murder junkies.  MCDOWELL: But don't -- but don't go watch the documentary because it's really disgusting.  GUTFELD: Yes. What was your -- what's the favorite part of your career? What's to come. That's the right answer. That's what Jesse would say.  WATTERS: How do you know?  GUTFELD: I knew it.  MCDOWELL: Exactly, how do you know? This is sappy but getting to spend time with the people here at work because everybody is really funny.  GUTFELD: Yes.  BRUCE: There you go.  WATTERS: That is not Imus?  MCDOWELL: Not Imus. Good speed Imus. I'll leave it at that.  GUTFELD: There you go. Geraldo still got that show inside him.  MCDOWELL: Yes.  GUTFELD: What about Imus? We'll be right back -- Jesse?  WATTERS: I mean, I only have two parts of my career. I was out on the streets, and now I sit here and listen to you. So what should I say, Greg?  GUTFELD: I'd say sitting here with your close friends entertaining America with your subtle wit and intellect.  WATTERS: OK.  RIVERA: And your mother's tweets.  WATTERS: Now, I like -- I want to go back to the streets after listening to this coverage.  GUTFELD: Tammy?  BRUCE: I used to do either just radio and now I was just doing just T.V., but now I'm doing both. So I like the combination of things that we do here, talking for a living and working. That's my favorite part of a career having a drop.  GUTFELD: I was a -- I was a juggler --  WATTERS: Getting paid.  BRUCE: Getting paid.  GUTFELD: I was a juggler at the carnival.  WATTERS: You were?  GUTFELD: Yes. I was a juggler at the carnival. It ended well. There were knives.  WATTERS: Did you wear those black leather pants?  GUTFELD: Yes, I did. You know, I got to say show I was looking at --  MCDOWELL: Shorts, leather shorts.  GUTFELD: I was looking at old clips of Red Eye and I was going like, I can't believe that aired. That show was the weirdest show.  WATTERS: They didn't burn those tapes.  GUTFELD: No, they're on YouTube. I watched like five of them last night. I'm going, holy crap.  BRUCE: For like 2:00 in the morning.  GUTFELD: Yes, yes. Best show.  WATTERS: Oh, you're a narcissist, aren't you?  GUTFELD: They were sent to me. Cass, what personality trait of yours has gotten you in the most trouble? All right, Tammy.  BRUCE: Well, the thing that also gets me working, my mouth, I suppose.  GUTFELD: Yes. There you go.  BRUCE: My talking. I'm you know, a Scottish, and Irish, and Italian, so I'm talking and I can shut up.  RIVERA: My chin. I got to -- come on, hit me right there.  WATTERS: I'd say my generosity. You know, everyone was pulling me in these directions, you know, how much can I give? What's so funny?  GUTFELD: It's so true. You know, oftentimes you're victimized over this.  WATTERS: I have so much to give.  GUTFELD: Yes, exactly. I don't know how you get through the day.  WATTERS: I don't know. I'm going to a charity event later.  GUTFELD: Oh, you're really -- are you going to a charity event later?  WATTERS: Yes, on a steakhouse across the street.  GUTFELD: Oh my god. I hope you're taking a car. I would hate to see you fall.  WATTERS: It is cold outside.  BRUCE: You're going to carry him over there, at least.  GUTFELD: What about -- what about you, Dagen.  MCDOWELL: Temper. I'm punching doors.  GUTFELD: Oh, wow.  MCDOWELL: If you blocking the -- block the box or block the crossway --  BRUCE: Oh yes, that's pretty bad.  MCDOWELL: Not punching anymore because I hurt my hand one time, but kicking it with my foot.  WATTERS: I've never seen you --  MCDOWELL: And by the way, cowboy boots, they'll do some damage, finishing is not so much.  BRUCE: It's horrible though, when someone walks into your fist like that.  GUTFELD: Yes. Mine is I'm allowed.  MCDOWELL: Not since I've been on.  GUTFELD: My problem --  WATTERS: You are allowed.  GUTFELD: Every time I get in trouble it's not because of the things that I've said. But what's been overheard because my voice is too loud.  WATTERS: I think it's partly what you've said too, Greg.  MCDOWELL: Yes, yes.  GUTFELD: All right, well, it could be. It's too late for me. ""ONE MORE THING"" is up next. That's nice. Music.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WATTERS: It's time for ""ONE MORE THING."" Greg.  GUTFELD: OK, the ""GREG GUTFELD SHOW"" tomorrow night. It's going to be a barn burner. And I don't mean I'm an arsonist so don't take that into account. February 22, 10.00 p.m. I got Walter Kirn, the great writer, Joe Machi, Kat Timpf, Tyrus. Watch it or I'll never forgive you. Now let's do this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Animals are great. Animals are great. Animals are great.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: They certainly are. All right, enough to that crap. This is such an adorable but exotic pet. I want one of these. You know what this is? Take a look at this beauty right here. Not me. Watch this amazing leaping abilities of the jumping bush baby. Look at that. It's also known as a galago or a galago, depending on how you pronounce it. Isn't that adorable?  Here's the deal. Exotic pets are so adorable, but you don't know anything about their vet bills or the size of their poop. That thing could be pooping all over the place. It's adorable, but then you get home and there's poop in your bed, but not from you, but from that thing. So I don't really know. Like, I want to know, can I own one of those? Write to me, galago owners.  WATTERS: OK, Greg, Slow it down. There's a long night ahead of you. All right, Watters has Jesse's bear news. Everybody get excited about a new graphic my producers put together in 45 minutes. Look at that. I don't know what that means. All right, so there's a bear on the streets.  GUTFELD: Bret Baier.  WATTERS: Yes, and the Chicago bears. Bear in the streets in Monrovia, California. Look at the size of that sucker. How much do you think that weighs?  GUTFELD: I don't know, but I like your bear voice.  WATTERS: Look at that guy. Look how close he's getting. Look at how close. What an idiot. Get away from that bear. It's going to take your face off. Eventually, they tranquilized it, Animal Control, thank you very much.  GUTFELD: Now I know what I feel.  WATTERS: Took it back to its natural habitat. There it is. Nice tranquilized bear. That'll be Greg but up midnight tonight. On Saturday night, 8:00 p.m. Eastern, you have ""WATTERS WORLD."" We're going to react live to the Nevada caucus results, and we have Blago, and he's dishing on what he knows about Barack Obama and what he knew about the selling of the Senate seat. Very interesting. Dagen McDowell.  MCDOWELL: Check out this surveillance footage from Ohio's Montgomery County Jail. A woman tries to escape. And guess, what she falls through the ceiling.  GUTFELD: Oh, one of those.  MCDOWELL: Yes. She climbed up on that. She was with a handful other occupants in a room and she was being held. Watch her.  BRUCE: There she goes.  MCDOWELL: She used a chair to climb to the ceiling. I just like watching people fall.  WATTERS: Nice try. Oh, and her pants.  BRUCE: She should get 10 points for that.  MCDOWELL: Oh, those soft --  GUTFELD: I don't -- I feel bad. I mean, she's probably wanted to get home.  MCDOWELL: She tried.  GUTFELD: Yes.  WATTERS: Nice effort, though.  MCDOWELL: I just love watching people fall.  WATTERS: All right. Do the crime, do the time. Geraldo?  RIVERA: New York Times' damning investigation today of a group home here in New York City for the population once housed in the big institutions once called the mentally retarded. They were in places like Willowbrook. This group home was awful, but that does not represent the group homes that we have advocated and helped to develop in this city and around the country. The group homes are wonderful. And we run 40 -- more than 40 of them in the New York area, an organization called Life's Work.  We raise funds, you know, and you should do it for you know, the Autism Speaks. A lot of these organizations have these group homes. I think you have a picture of me and Sean Hannity. We do the golf tournament every year with these. These are the kids in the group home. One of them, Bauer. Many group homes.  There's Sean and I. We play golf together. 35 years I've had that tournament. We did charity boxing matches. It's just a great, great cause. Support -- and Medicaid is drying up. These folks are desperate for help, so be charitable.  WATTERS: All right. I can get a golf invite next time.  RIVERA: Yes, come on, man. Do you play?  WATTERS: All right, yes, a little bit. All right, go ahead.  BRUCE: Alrighty. Well, a pizza delivery man got a very special surprise that warms everyone's heart. First of all, take a look at this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you. I appreciate it. Enjoy. Have a good night.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you. Good night.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Bye, bye.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Bye, bye.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He's try to get on my --  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Enjoy your pizza.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Then a woman fell through the ceiling.  BRUCE: Yes, well, you know, that his two-year-old Cohen, loved getting the pizza, he obviously went out and hugged him. What we found out though through Facebook is when this pizza delivery man reached the mom after this went viral because he had recently lost a 16-year-old daughter. And he is noting that this felt like a message and it has really helped him.  WATTERS: I thought you're going to say the pizza man was his real father.  BRUCE: No, no. Not at all.  WATTERS: That would have been something.  BRUCE: Not at all.  WATTERS: All right, that's a wrap. Have a great weekend, everybody. See you back here on Monday.

70,FOX,"For Democrats, it's worse being a billionaire who started businesses than an apologist for the Soviet Union during the Cold War. So how about the Democratic presidential debate Wednesday in Nevada? Awesome, right? Turns out all it took was a little “chum” to get the sharks feeding. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg was the little chum who got eaten alive. ""A billionaire who calls women fat broads and horse-faced lesbians,"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said of Bloomberg. ""I thought that he shouldn't be hiding behind his TV ads,"" Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said. ""We are sick and tired of billionaires like Mr. Bloomberg seeing huge expansions of their wealth while a half a million people sleep out on the street tonight,"" added Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. BLOOMBERG HITS BACK AFTER TRUMP SAYS 'MINI MIKE' IS 'ILLEGALLY BUYING THE DEMOCRAT NOMINATION' I haven't seen someone look more out of place since Jesse Watters went to confession. Not only did Bloomberg not have a box, he didn't know how to box. Flat-footed at each turn, he exhibited the agility of a corpse. Warren led the attack relentlessly. Former Vice President Joe Biden, for once, seemed semi-coherent. Klobuchar took the opportunity to clobber the word-faucet that is former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.  CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER The big winner? Sanders, who barely got touched, because everyone wanted a piece of the billionaire. Sanders was like a magician benefiting from misdirection. Here, everyone! Look at laughable “Mini Mike” while I steal the nomination. Of course, Mike had it coming. You don't enter late in the game, throw cash at the crowd, then tell those who've already been playing to drop out once you arrive. Plus, his reputation is piggish. But it's a sobering observation. Among Democrats, it's worse to be a billionaire who started businesses than to have been an apologist for the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Because the Cold War was, like, history. And that was 31 years ago. A long time. So maybe Bernie just forgot, like all his supporters did. That's scary for the rest of us, who prefer capitalism over socialism and who rooted for America, not the Soviet Union, in the 1970s and 80s. We see that success, competition, profit, jobs and incentives can change lives. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Sadly, Bloomberg worked hard, but all he got was rich. He never stood a chance.

ELIZABETH WARREN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: A billionaire who calls women's fat broads and horse-faced lesbians. And no, I'm not talking about Donald Trump. I'm talking about Mayor Bloomberg.  SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I thought that he shouldn't be hiding behind his TV ads.  JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He has stop and frisk, throwing close to five million young black men up against a wall.  SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We are sick and tired of billionaires like Mr. Bloomberg seeing huge expansions of their wealth, while half a million people sleep out on the street tonight.  PETE BUTTIGIEG (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Mayor Bloomberg, who thinks he can buy this election.  MICHAEL BLOOMBERG (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We have a very few nondisclosure agreements --  WARREN: How many is that?  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: I haven't seen someone look more out of place since Jesse went to confession. Meanwhile, those who feasted on mini-Mike benefited. Not only did Bloomberg not have a box, he didn't know how to box. Caught flat-footed at each turn, he exhibited the agility of a corpse. Liz led the attack relentlessly. Biden, for once, seemed semi-coherent.  Amy K. took the opportunity to clobber the word faucet that is Mayor Pete. But the big winner, Bernie, who barely got touched because everyone wanted a piece of the billionaire, Sanders was like a magician benefiting from misdirection. Here, everyone, look at laughable mini-Mike while I steal the nomination. Of course, Mike had it coming.  You don't enter late in the game. Throw cash at the crowd then tell those who are already been playing to drop out because you arrived. Plus, his reputation is piggish, but it's a sobering observation. Among Democrats, it's worse being a billionaire who started businesses than an apologist for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.  Because the Cold War was, like, history, and that was 31 years ago, a long time. So maybe Bernie just forgot, like all of his supporters did. That's scary for the rest of us who prefer capitalism over socialism, who rooted for America, docked the USSR in the 70s and 80s, who see that success in competition and profit, jobs, and incentives can actually change lives.  Sadly, Bloomberg worked hard and all he got was rich. He never stood a chance. All right, can we just admit, Dagen, that that was so much fun? It was so much -- I was having a blast last night.  DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS HOST: It was a little hard to watch. Like, in my private time, I watch supercar crash fails, where you have this arrogant rich guy who gets behind the wheel of, like, six or a seven figure car. And because he is a clown and a jerk and full of himself, he wrecks the car immediately. And I derive deep, immense amounts of pleasure from watching that.  But even last night, this was so awkward and painful. I think people will have pity on him and they will give Mike Bloomberg a second chance. But you -- I've been where he has been. You are getting up there in age and you're getting inside of your own head, and all you are thinking about is don't be an ass. Don't be an ass. Don't yell at her. Don't yell at her. And you can't do anything else because you're just stuck in your own noggin.  GUTFELD: Well, do you think this hurts him? I mean, it hurts him. But do you think it knocks him out?  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: I don't think it knocks him out. And I don't think it will hurt him as much because he's got so much money in the race. Now, there was a big turnout for people who watched last night. This was not your average primary debate. So people that tuned in saw Mike Bloomberg for the first time on stage rather than just on an ad, and they might say, well, gosh, maybe he is not that great.  But I still think, you know, overnight he picked up these four endorsements from congressional members. He got another one in South Carolina. And the thing is, if he didn't have to debate again before the voting, maybe he could've hanged on. But there is another debate in four days, but I kind of wish that he had just let his inside voice out.  GUTFELD: Yes, like Trump does.  PERINO: Yeah. And then when went after him on stop and frisk, say OK, actually, let me set the stage here. He was pretty good at telling them not to interrupt him. He does not like to be interrupted and shut that down. And Elizabeth Warren, I think -- look you know who she says she hates billionaires so much, and she and her campaign, she was not going to take money from billionaires.  She had this whole thing. Guess what happened today? Oh, there is a Super PAC that wants to donate in her name and she is not going to disavow it. So everybody has to play the game.  GUTFELD: Geraldo, where do you put this in performances of debates you have seen?  GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS HOST: Horrifying.  GUTFELD: Yeah.  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: Shocking. I was at 21. I had lunch with my buddy, David Cheryl (ph), and he said what they are saying on Wall Street is that he brought his wallet to a knife fight.  GUTFELD: That's good.  RIVERA: I thought it was a shoddy performance by Mayor Bloomberg. I thought he was unprepared. How could he not be ready for the obvious attacks that, you know, your grandmother knew were coming? I thought -- that was the part that seemed most shocking to me, how woefully unprepared he was. I mean, it's not just -- I mean if you have a staff of 40,000 people, at least half, like, two guys to give you six zingers to use over a two hour debate.  You know it's going to be about stop and frisk. Have an answer for stop and frisk. You know it's going to be about buying your way into the race. Have an answer for buying your way into the race. Talk about the struggle. Talk about, you know, your family had nothing. And this is the American dream and why are we putting down the American dream.  And how did we become this nation of mediocrity where, you know, success is somehow something to be shunned? I thought that it was really very amateur.  GUTFELD: He wasn't a good proponent for capitalism. That was the problem. Jesse, do you want to respond to Trump's tweet about this or would you like to just give your thoughts extemporaneously?  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, I don't care. I just -- remember yesterday when Geraldo said Mike was -- have a great night. Remember that? I didn't forget, Geraldo.  RIVERA: Oh, I have very short term memory loss.  WATTERS: Yeah. You are like Klobuchar, you can't remember names.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: The phrase that was -- you kept hearing in the media was circular firing squad, which is a cliche, of course. It was bad overall for the Dems?  WATTERS: No. I would say he injected a little adrenaline into the field. They started showing their teeth.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: -- getting a little competitive. He was kind of like a Trump light-up. He's basically like a weak Republican. They gave him a nice, fat target and they took advantage of it. But I mean, he paid $400 million for that beat down.  GUTFELD: Yes.  WATTERS: Maybe he is into that kind of thing.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: I would've done it for half that.  WATTERS: Yeah, I know.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: I've heard about it. And he probably wishes he had a little box to crawl under after that performance. He just didn't live up to the hype. The guy was shaky. He was unprepared. And what you wanted to see out of Mike, you talked about this. You just mentioned it. You wanted to see a boss out there. And he acted like an intern. If Liz Warren says show us your NDA, he should've said, well, no. Well, you showed us your DNA and that didn't work out.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: It's not that hard. Remember when -- you called this woman a horse toothed lesbian, I -- he should've said only the Royal Family.  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: Only Rosie O'Donnell.  WATTERS: Only Rosie O'Donnell.  PERINO: And he also could have said -- and I'm talking about the consultants that could have given him a line. If she was going to bring that up, he could've said didn't just last week your staff in Las Vegas leave because of a hostile workplace, because that happened.  GUTFELD: We should be running his campaign.  PERINO: I know.  GUTFELD: Really -- spending all that money.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: And I think that because it's one thing to not be on the debate stage, but he also doesn't do any interviews to get himself into a little bit of fighting shape.  GUTFELD: Yeah. That DNA line is a winner.  WATTERS: Yup. I mean, I would've sold that to him for --  RIVERA: But I tell you. As soon as it was over, there was a spot on advertisement for Bloomberg. And then there was one this morning when I woke up. Soon, there's going to be so many of those.  MCDOWELL: He set fire to all of that. He burned half a billion dollars on that debate stage last night. They have to start all over again.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: It's like false advertising because you see this Bloomberg in an ad and it is not the guy you saw last night.  GUTFELD: Yeah. All right, coming up, President Trump weighs in on Roger Stone after his sentencing today.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WATTERS: Crazy scene outside the courthouse after Republicans operative, Roger Stone, was sentenced to more than three years in prison. He's also going to have to pay $25,000 thousand in fines for lying to Congress, witness tampering, and obstructing the House Russia collusion investigation. The judge saying the nine-year sentence prosecutors originally sought was excessive and Stone could still end up getting a new trial over evidence of juror bias.  There is also debate over whether President Trump should pardon Stone. And the president weighed in on that earlier.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The forewoman of the jury, the woman who was in charge of the jury, is totally tainted. When you take a look, how can you have a person like this? She was an anti-Trump activist. What happened to him is unbelievable. They say he lied. But other people lie too. Just to mention, Comey lied. McCabe lied. Lisa Page lied. Her lover, Strzok, Peter Strzok lied.  You don't know who these people are? Just trust me. They all lied. But I am just not going to do anything in terms of the great powers bestowed upon a president of the United States. I want the process to play out. I would love to see Roger exonerated.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: Will he be exonerated, do you think, if he gets a new trial because of that tainted juror?  RIVERA: I think he has excellent grounds for a new trial based on the obvious. She ran for Congress as a Democrat. She is a very anti-Trumpian person. You know, I spoke to the president about Rochester (ph) last Thursday. And I said, you know, Mr. President, he's always been a pain in the ass. But this is very unfair. I never liked him. I think he is a bully, a braggart, a big mouth.  But -- and, you know, a merry prankster -- not so merry prankster. But this is a very, very unfair -- this is a process crime. They trapped him in a perjury trap just like General Flynn. It's disgusting what these prosecutors in their self-righteousness, which makes me, puke how they go after these people and then say they are doing god's work.  It is appalling, and then seven to nine years? You know, people guilty of manslaughter, they're walking out in four, five years. Seven to nine years for that? That is what they wanted. And then they criticize Attorney General Barr for saying perhaps that is excessive. I think that people hate Trump so much that they suspend reason in a way that, you know is -- to use the word appalling is tiresome.  I know that. But I just -- I feel very strongly. If I, who don't like this guy, feel this way, imagine if you are, you know, the president, who actually likes him.  WATTERS: Yeah. Dagen, Geraldo mentioned Bill Barr. He originally recommended around that four your sentence and that's what the judge agreed with. So all those people saying Barr was out of line, they look pretty stupid right now.  MCDOWELL: Indeed, as they always do. I think that one of the things that President Trump will do is keep bringing up Roger Stone and the possibility of a new trial. What do I might do? Because he likes to see the chattering classes get the vapors (ph). Oh, my god, can you believe what Trump did today? Like, clutching their chest, but just to point out, Geraldo is exactly right.  Roger Stone, when he was initially arrested, I think about two dozen federal agents with assault rifles showed up at his house at, like, 5:30 in the morning. There was a boat -- with CNN with a boat behind the house and a helicopter whirly bird in the air. And it's just -- again, you don't go to jail if you hate Trump. But if you are associated with him, they will throw the book at you and then some.  WATTERS: Yeah. This was the same judge, Greg that put Manafort in solitary confinement. I mean, this is tough stuff.  GUTFELD: I agree completely with Geraldo. I -- it's -- you have to separate your feelings about Roger Stone, which often aren't very good because he's done some pretty bad stuff. But I think everybody agrees. Barr and the judge was at the sentence was too long. And to the jury forewoman should have never been there. I would say that this is worthy of a new trial and not just a sentencing.  But I think that what Trump is trying to do, he's attempting to rectify the collateral damage of a witch hunt, in which it was backfilled. Like, they initiated the witch hunt and then they backfilled it with investigations and prosecutions, and trapped all these people. And now, he's just trying to pick it all apart and pardon this and pardon that, which makes sense.  But it is -- I'm with Geraldo on it. It's like you have to separate feelings from the actual facts.  WATTERS: So Dana, politically, I guess the president is going to let this appeal play out. And then if he does get sentenced, he may pardon at some point.  PERINO: I think he telegraphed pretty clearly what's going to happen at the end of this no matter what. But I wouldn't be so sure. You know, a new trial is not necessarily your best friend. That happened to Blagojevich, remember? He had the sec -- it was on the second trial that he got even more time. So I'm just saying.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: And also I would say pardons -- the power of that is quite powerful. You can do it for your friends. You can do it for whoever you want. But I did think it was really nice today when -- at the Hope for Prisoners event, President Trump is introduced by a man who has dedicated his life, post-prison, to helping prisoners not have to go back because they did something bad and help them find a job.  He did all of this stuff. And he himself had a record. And when the president got up, he said I have a feeling. I know that there's going to be a pardon for somebody. And, you know, like, those of the people that are really deserving.  WATTERS: Yeah. And I think, to date, President Trump's pardoned less people than almost every other president in the last 30 years.  RIVERA: Remember. Obama pardoned the Puerto Rican terrorist, you know, Oscar Lopez Rivera that blew up FALN.  WATTERS: Do you have to bring up Obama, seriously, Geraldo? Can we go one show without bringing up? Up next, how bad was last night's debate for the Democrats? The liberal media says Trump was the big winner.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PERINO: Welcome back. Many in the mainstream media are saying President Trump was the winner of last night's Democratic debate. It's probably because the Democrats spent most of their time attacking each other instead of the commander in chief.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  BUTTIGIEG: Let's put forward somebody who is actually a Democrat.  KLOBUCHAR: I wish everyone was as perfect as you, Pete.  SANDERS: Let's level. Let's level, Pete.  BIDEN: So the facts are --  (CROSSTALK)  BLOOMBERG: Let me finish. Thank you.  WARREN: It's not a plan. It's a power point. And Amy's plan is even worse. It's like a post-it note. Insert plan here.  (CROSSTALK)  KLOBUCHAR: No, no, no.  (CROSSTALK)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, hello, hello, hello.  SANDERS: My turn now?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, sir.  SANDERS: OK.  (CROSSTALK)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are at the end here. I've got to let that one go.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: Meanwhile, President Trump was on message during a rally in Arizona.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: Washington Democrats had never been more extreme, taking cues from crazy Bernie sanders. How is he doing tonight? You know I came up with the name Pocahontas too early. But fortunately, she self-destructed anyway. Did you ever see a phoney like that? And now they have a new member of the crew, mini-Mike. We call him no-box. And I hear he is getting pounded tonight. You know, he is in the debate. I hear they are pounding him.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: President Trump has another rally in just a few hours from now in Colorado, where a big crowd is expected. They were already -- they camped out overnight. It's only 10 degrees out there. Jesse, what about the Democrats deciding to beat up on Mike Bloomberg and not even on Bernie sanders who is the actual frontrunner, let alone going after Trump?  WATTERS: I think what you want to do if you're a Democrat is you want to attack a Bernie or a Bloomberg, and then just you have to pivot to attacking the president, because that's what the audience wants to hear. And that is what people at home want to watch. And last night, and now today, feels to me like the worst day Democrats have had in a very long time.  Think about it. Smell that? Feel the air? There is no Donald Trump scandal that is hanging over right now. There is nothing. There is no impeachment. There's no Ukraine. There's no collusion. Bloomberg has cratered, I believe. Maybe a soft fall, because of the cash, and Bernie, a -- I guess 78-year-old socialist who just had a heart attack -- get the nomination.  This is not a good time to be a Democrat. I think if you look at who won, who lost, Bernie wins, Bloomberg fades, Mayor Pete I thought did well. I thought he tried to separate. You know, Bernie is trying to blow the party up. Bloomberg is trying to buy it. Look at me in the middle. Amy is probably the next one to drop out. She is running out of money.  And I think may be a lifeline got thrown to Elizabeth Warren, and Biden seems like an afterthought at this point.  PERINO: Maybe when -- did Warren may be debut as a possible good vice presidential choice and she could be the attack dog?  RIVERA: This, to me, was her renaissance. I thought that she was really on point. She was as formidable as she has been. She was all over the place, muddled and meandering, you know, in recent weeks. And so I thought that she was really, really on point. But I think that it is very starkly clear now. I agree with Jesse that Bloomberg, although I like him very much and I obviously I appreciate his policies a lot more than I do the Democrats.  I think that what we have here, for the first time since may be Roosevelt, you know, you have a real right-left, you know, conservative, liberal, socialist, capitalist, election where the American people will decide. And I tell you why. Don't underestimate the desire for socialism, you know, communism light. People want free stuff.  They want equality. They want to share the wealth, particularly if it's not there's and they didn't earn it.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: And we're going to talk about that in depth, I think, the next block. I do want to show, Greg, this media montage.  GUTFELD: I love a montage.  PERINO: They complain about the Democrats a little bit.  GUTFELD: Wow.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I thought it was a great night for Bernie Sanders. I thought it was a great night for Donald Trump. I thought it was a terrible night for the Democrats.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They were going after each other way too much.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are two days away from the voting in Nevada. And they attacked a guy who is not on the ballot in Nevada. It's -- I thought it was tactically really dumb.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Democrats perfecting the circular firing squad.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The man they are all running against, Donald J. Trump hardly took any fire at all.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Nobody laid a glove on him. They were too busy tearing each other to shreds in an intramural ping-pong game.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: So much disappointment.  GUTFELD: You know, it's interesting, you watch MSNBC and CNN, and you get that underlying sense that Trump is better and more skilled more agile than they have ever given him credit for. It used to be he was just unstable, emotionally petulant. But they're kind of like watching this and they go, well, Trump has showed them that it's not that easy to go out there and to fight and to be --  If he was where Bloomy was, none of this stuff would've have happened to Bloomy. But that's the thing. It's like I understand why impeachment why so important, because they're -- they look at their group and they're looking at Trump and they're going, oh crap, we are in trouble, you know?  PERINO: What did you make of Amy Klobuchar getting so -- kind of offended by Mayor Pete? She really doesn't like him.  MCDOWELL: It makes people wonder why that hatred is so deep seated. She's made fun of him not being able to basically win an office outside of being the mayor of the fourth largest city in Indiana. And -- but it was uncomfortable, but it seemed pointless for them to be going after one another, but I like discomfort.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Remember he went after her because -- and she said she made a -- I thought it was great when she said I made a mistake. I couldn't remember the name of the Mexican president.  MCDOWELL: He should never go after her for a gotcha question --  (CROSSTALK)  MCDOWELL: They're going to come for her.  PERINO: I think that they should have gone back at the moderator with a gotcha question.  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: Can you name the governor of Minnesota?  GUTFELD: Yeah.  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: Didn't you think he was snotty, though when he did that?  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: I thought lacked kindness.  WATTERS: If I was Amy, I would've said, OK. I forgot the name of the Mexican president, but I know the name of next U.S. president.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: He had some best lines last night when you're writing them down.  MCDOWELL: Can I add one thing to what Greg was saying?  PERINO: Yes, sure.  MCDOWELL: The enthusiasm among the Trump voters is so head and shoulders above the enthusiasm for anybody watching that debate. Can you -- but again, it's a small group of people. Can you imagine what President Trump's been through? The investigation during his campaign, Mueller report, impeachment, and he's still boom, boom, boom, checking off boxes of all his campaign promises. And he's still funny. And he's still on the balls of his feet and he is ready. He just gives me that Democratic candidate. He's ready for him.  GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT AT LARGE: He's Godzilla against Mickey Mouse.  WATTERS: I thought Mickey Mouse could beat him. That's what Biden said.  PERINO: That was Biden's line. Yes, it was. Jesse is back. He's back through Monday.  GUTFELD: He got some sleep last night. He got some sleep, did some exercise.  PERINO: We miss you, buddy.  WATTERS: Everybody shut up.  PERINO: All right, straight ahead --  GUTFELD: What does Emma do when you're like --  PERINO: Mike Bloomberg and Bernie Sanders battle over Democrats' embrace of socialism.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  RIVERA: A big fight breaking out on the debate stage as you know over a major issue dividing the Democrats' socialism versus capitalism. We spoke about it before. Bernie Sanders and Michael Bloomberg butting heads early and off.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  BLOOMBERG: We're not going to throw out capitalism. We tried that, other countries tried that. It was called communism and it just didn't work.  SANDERS: Let's talk about Democratic Socialism, not communism, Mr. Bloomberg. That's a cheap shot.  BLOOMBERG: The best-known socialists in the country happens to be a millionaire with three houses. What did I miss here?  SANDERS: Well, you'll miss that I work in Washington, house ones.  BLOOMBERG: That's the first problem.  SANDERS: Live in Burlington, house two.  BLOOMBERG: That's good.  SANDERS: And like thousands of other Vermonters, I do have a summer camp. Forgive for that. Where is your home? Which tax -- which tax haven do you have your home?  BLOOMBERG: New York City, thank you very much. And I pay for my whole taxes.  SANDERS: You know what, Mr. Bloomberg, it wasn't you who made all that money, maybe your workers played some role in that as well.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  RIVERA: You didn't build that. And now Bloomberg is trolling Democrats with the new ad that exaggerates their reactions when he said this during the debate.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  BLOOMBERG: I'm the only one here that I think that's ever started the business. Is that fair?  (END VIDEO CLIP)  RIVERA: Did that really happen? I thought that was brilliant. Was that (INAUDIBLE)  MCDOWELL: No. Graceland agree with me on this. Anytime reporters start wringing their hands about a political ad which is exactly what happened all over social media when that ad came out, but Mike Bloomberg needed to elucidate the dangers of socialism versus the benefits of capitalism much more clearly.  You're not lucky, Mike. You work your ass off. You're smart. And that's the system we have in the United States. Do you think any of those other people standing on that stage make better decisions about your livelihood, your life, your family, your health, your health care? They are career politicians who don't know shoes from their ears, and they want to take over your life. He just needed to lay it out like that.  RIVERA: But have you ever heard him you know, in private? He's a very articulate, very reasonable, very powerful, you know, charismatic guy in his own quiet way. And none of that was there last night.  MCDOWELL: Quiet doesn't work on a debate stage when you got shouting -- mixed shout Bernie Sanders down at the -- in the middle of him.  RIVERA: But now, we get to the capitalism socialism. When you're a young person, I was -- I was the lawyer for the young lords. I was right in the middle of that I wanted to take down the man. I didn't trust anybody over 30 years old. There is amazing -- you know, there's an intoxication almost about, share and share alike and making the world a fairer place. Don't you think that's this potency that we --  WATTERS: Yes, I agree. Socialism is a drug, Geraldo. And Bernie has got a bunch of people hooked. And it's going to be trouble come election time because they're going to have to go through withdrawal. Bernie --  RIVERA: But I don't believe that. I don't -- no --  WATTERS: Oh, you really -- listen, it's not a large segment of the population.  RIVERA: You don't think that --  WATTERS: Everybody under 30 is feeling the burn but as you grow older and you get more responsible, and you start making more money and have a family, you sort of take that to the side.  RIVERA: Millennials can't buy a house. My kids can't buy a house on their own.  WATTERS: Maybe they should major in anthropology. I don't know what to tell them, Geraldo. That's their choice.  RIVERA: It's because baby boomers like me bought three houses like Bernie Sanders. That's why they can't buy a house.  WATTERS: OK. And you know what -- no, no, no, he didn't buy a house, Geraldo. He has a summer camp. or although He has a summer camp.  RIVERA: Summer camp.  WATTERS: I want to know. Can I send my kids to Bernie's summer camp?  PERINO: Wait, do you want to?  WATTERS: Is he going to teach them how to sail? I mean, come on, Bernie. Yes, what is a summer camp mean?  RIVERA: But does -- isn't this, Dana, when you get right down to it? Isn't this really what the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, what they stand for, one is kind of share, and share, like, and the other is pull yourself up by your bootstraps, be all you're capable of being, and then, you know, for yourself first and then for others?  PERINO: I think the Democrats would love for that to be the case. But now, what they're having is you said it very well I think in the A-block where you said that this is the first election in many decades, where you're actually going to have an ideological debate. Like, let's have it OK. Like if we're going to have a debate about capitalism versus socialism and the direction of the country, it's going to be fascinating and people better get their self -- get themselves organized.  Bloomberg was showing Republicans exactly how to get under Bernie Sanders' skin. He does not like to talk about his wealth. And I think if I were President Trump and his campaign team, I would do something a Republican president doesn't usually do. President Trump is good at that, right. He goes to places nobody else would go. I'd go to Vermont. I would have a rally outside the (INAUDIBLE) and just -- and say, look at what capitalism was able to provide. And he never even --  RIVERA: Outside the DACA, you mean the Bernie Sanders camp?  PERINO: Yes. I got that from Dagen, though, so I can't really --  MCDOWELL: I mispronounced it though.  RIVERA: I appreciated when President Trump, candidate Trump flew his 757 someplace in Ohio. I forget which town it was. And then he gave kids rides on this helicopter. That was an ostentatious --  PERINO: It was at the state fair.  RIVERA: It was ostentatious display of wealth that I thought worked in a way that separated from the other candidates. And why not Bloomberg saying I have 40,000 employees. Why not say that? This little Johnny who's going to college thanks to his mother's working at the Bloomberg Inc.  GUTFELD: Because we -- why is this happening is we've replaced achievement with identity so -- which is really the first step towards revolution is we've seen this in the past, it's not what you do. It's who you are. That's the first step before they cut your head off. You know, that's the place where venomous envy begins. It's who you are.  So you're rich, you're white, you're old, you're out. The problem with Sanders, is that we got -- you got an incredibly -- you got one of the greatest economies ever. It's a risk to put him or Liz in charge. It probably won't be a risk with Joe or Amy or Bloomberg because they're pragmatic. Pragmatic means you're going to preserve what works. But if you give this economy over to Sanders, it's like handing a brand new Ferrari right off the line to a drunk.  And that's the thing. You can't -- people have to understand that this is a big risk you're taking with somebody like this. This is -- this economy just doesn't flow as it goes. You got -- you got to have people who understand it. Audience, we brought this up, booing or groaning when somebody defends capitalism is disgusting. What a bunch of morons.  RIVERA: But that is the, you know, the emotion that Sanders plays often. And I think it's very potent and I -- and I think you're at your own peril to ignore the potency of socialism. You know, there are a lot of people a lot of -- particularly the young that I think are really going to go for it. Trump still wins. The ""FASTEST SEVEN"" is up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  MCDOWELL: Welcome back. Time for the ""FASTEST SEVEN."" First, up, viewer warning, this next story is gross. Burger King is out with a nauseating new ad campaign which shows a time-lapse video of a whopper growing mold. It's to show off that the restaurant has removed all artificial preservatives from the company's menu. Greg, you're shaking your head.  GUTFELD: Imagine -- how stupid this is. Imagine a funeral home doing the same thing. You know, if we don't preserve granny and buy this deluxe casket, this is how granny is going to look and then they wheel up this decayed corpse. This is the worst. People don't go to Burger King to fret about their preservatives, you idiots. They go because they're hungover, they're tired, they want to eat that food in a dark closet and hope for a short death.  PERINO: I totally disagree.  GUTFELD: Really?  PERINO: I think this is great because I as a person that is kind of interested in staying healthy, I want to cut back on preservatives and things like that.  GUTFELD: Preservatives are great.  PERINO: But -- well, yes for some things. But like if you want fresh food, then they're telling you that you got to eat it fast. You don't like -- you don't take a whopper at home and eat it two weeks later.  GUTFELD: Are these Burger King?  WATTERS: I disagree with you, and here's why. I mean, you don't want to think about mold when you're looking at a burger.  GUTFELD: Exactly.  WATTERS: This is like you call your ad agency and you fire them right now.  GUTFELD: Yes, fire everybody.  WATTERS: Permission to make it an analogy?  GUTFELD: Absolutely.  WATTERS: This is like Trojan condoms running an ad and people are having sex in the bed and they time-lapse it, and the next thing you know the woman's pregnant. That's not what you want to see. It's the opposite.  PERINO: Greg, before you grand him permission --  GUTFELD: That was actually -- it is actually a pretty good one.  WATTERS: It's the opposite of what you want.  GUTFELD: But that might actually work.  RIVERA: There's a New York street word called skeevy. That skeeves me out. It's disgusting. And I would never -- I will I eat a Burger King, I promise you, for fear that I'll be eating --  PERINO: When was the last time you had Burger King?  RIVERA: I can't remember.  PERINO: Right, exactly. You're not their target audience.  MCDOWELL: My -- what my daddy would do, oh, give me that. He pulled out his pocket knife and just cut that molds.  PERINO: My grandpa too.  MCDOWELL: Yes, exactly. Cut off, you know, turtle's head, a little mold. It's good for everything. Next up, a woman becoming an online sensation after her amazing singing voice is discovered. And what we're told is a random challenge video. Was it staged? You'd be the judge.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's the lyrics. Tell me something girl. Are you happy in this modern world?  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Or do you need more? I'm at the deep end. Watch as I dive in. I never leave the ground.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: I don't think her voice is that good.  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: And I also think it's obviously staged because if you're coming into a subway and someone puts a microphone in your face, I would kick them in that you know what. Don't mess with me in the subway. Obviously, it's staged. I mean, I hope he has a great career in singing if that's what she's going for, but I don't think it's real.  GUTFELD: That's why you know, the tell is anybody stopping. Nobody stops unless you're a tourist and she's the local.  WATTERS: Wait a second. You want to kick a man on the street in New York at the you know what, Dana?  PERINO: In the subway. In the subway.  WATTERS: How dare you? How dare you?  RIVERA: I think that, first of all, subways have the best acoustics. When the trains coming, the echo chamber is fabulous. Everybody sounds good. And I agree with Dana. I wouldn't cut her record deal. I don't think it was staged.  MCDOWELL: Everybody sounds good compared to me singing Onward Christian Soldiers when I was like seven at church and ever sang again in public. Finally, nanny state alert. A new county -- well, a New York County is proposing a law that would ban people from smoking inside their own homes. The band would impact people living in apartment buildings or multifamily dwellings. It's all in an effort to curb exposure to secondhand smoke. If they find out weed, it includes weed, and not just tobacco, I guarantee you, don't --  GUTFELD: Or vaping?  MCDOWELL: Yes. Don't go ahead with her.  RIVERA: You mean that will be the one thing that makes people --  MCDOWELL: Yes. People will be like --  PERINO: I think there's already law in the U.K.  RIVERA: Cigarette smoke is horrible in an apartment though. If you -- if someone is downstairs and smoking, and it's inside and the windows are closed particularly in wintertime. It is -- you choke on it and you worry about your own children. You know, and weed, I don't think that New Yorkers make a distinction other than to suggest that cigarette smoking is more repugnant than weed.  WATTERS: Wait, where are you going tonight, Geraldo? Where are you going for tonight?  RIVERA: I'm going to the Havana.  WATTERS: OK.  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: Go 21, Havana club, they can have --  MCDOWELL: Rich people are smoking.  GUTFELD: OK, here's the thing. I think that if they -- if they focus on vaping, they're in big trouble. I understand --  RIVERA: Vaping is a different thing.  GUTFELD: Oh, yes. But they're trying to make it the same thing because they're losers. I have a question. Have we ever actually verified the science of secondhand smoke? Like that seems like some -- I don't think that's ever -- I mean, this is -- this is the turf of Reason Magazine and Jacob Sullum that like, I wonder if we just accepted that --  WATTERS: But isn't it logical though?  PERINO: No, but I think -- well --  GUTFELD: I think that -- I think it's -- I think there's a lot of controversy under secondhand smoke. It would make sense because maybe it's a marker for other unhealthy stuff. But I've often -- I've often wondered - -  RIVERA: That may be true. That may be true.  MCDOWELL: If you live next to a chain smoker in a rental building, it smells all the time. Right, Jesse?  WATTERS: Well, I don't smoke. And if someone ratted me out, I'm going to get him back. I know where their car parks.  RIVERA: Hooping on their doorstep.  WATTERS: Oh, I have many ways, Geraldo. Try me.  MCDOWELL: ""ONE MORE THING"" --  RIVERA: I don't smoke.  GUTFELD: Vaping?  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: One -- I have a tummy ache.  RIVERA: Rub his belly.  GUTFELD: People hate me. ""ONE MORE THING."" It's Jesse.  WATTERS: All right, at Fox News, all we do is win not just on air but also online. Shout out to Porter Barry. He used to E.P. THE FIVE and ""HANNITY."" Now he runs Fox News digital. They had a record-breaking January, and beat CNN and multi-platform minutes for the 16th consecutive month. So nice job.  MCDOWELL: It's a great Web site.  WATTERS: And I'll be on ""HANNITY"" tonight 9:00 p.m. Eastern time. Don't miss that.  GUTFELD: Porter has really come along, you know.  RIVERA: Yes. He's a great guy.  PERINO: We taught him well.  GUTFELD: No, it's true. I mean, despite all the problems.  PERINO: Yes, and the jacket.  GUTFELD: Yes, and the jacket.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Dana?  PERINO: All right, well, there's a construction crew in Chattanooga, Tennessee. They had to do a little extra work this morning because there's a little basset hound named buddy. And he went for a swim in the drink, but he didn't really know how to get out. He was stuck down there in the river. And so they had to call the Hamilton County Stars rescue team and they got on the scene there. They made sure no one was hurt during the recovery operation and Buddy successfully got his paws back on dry land. Thanks to those great rescuers.  GUTFELD: That's a nice story, Dana.  PERINO: Isn't it?  GUTFELD: It ended happily. Happy ending. Let's do this.  PERINO: What's that?  GUTFELD: I don't know.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Animals are great. Animals are great. Animals are great.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: You know, sometimes it's hard to play a game attack because some people are faster than you. I always eat and I always had to hide under the bed sometimes for days. Check out this pair. You got to -- you got a weird combination going here. You got to you got a corgi. Eugene is a corgi and you got a tortoise. I don't know the -- oh, the tortoise's name is Shaq. I don't know. But I can't stop following Eugene, the corgi. Eugene, why do you give a corgi a human name?  WATTERS: I don't know.  GUTFELD: I find that disgusting. Anyway --  PERINO: He's just running from the turtle.  GUTFELD: Yes. well, the turtle will not give up.  RIVERA: I never saw an attack turtle before.  GUTFELD: Yes. This -- it turns very violent, and we're going to have to cut it off before they eat each other. But I just wanted a lesson for kids at home.  RIVERA: That a true pervert piece.  GUTFELD: Yes. There you go.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Animals are great. Animals are great. Animals are great.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Dagen?  MCDOWELL: More animals.  RIVERA: More animals?  MCDOWELL: Yes, Georgetown, Colorado has a new mayor. Clear Creek County swore in Parker, the snow dog, as the honorary mayor of Georgetown. Mayor Parker arrived to the inauguration ceremony wearing as he should always a tie and glasses. His tail was wagging. I'm guessing he's a Bernese Mountain dog. That's what he looks like. He's committed to bringing hugs, love, and cookies to the people of Georgetown. He's got probably more followers on Instagram than I do, about 17 and a half thousand, I think. Official-Snow- Dog.  GUTFELD: How does he feel about socialism? Does he believe in sharing the kibble?  MCDOWELL: Yes.  WATTERS: They're so high in Colorado, they elected a dog as mayor. What a bunch of idiots.  MCDOWELL: I think -- you know what, I take a dog over De Blasio all day long.  GUTFELD: All right, Geraldo.  RIVERA: Speaking about being high in Colorado.  GUTFELD: Yes.  RIVERA: Last Friday, Valentine's Day was Erica and my 20th Valentine's Day together. To celebrate you went to Beaver Creek, Colorado. We went skiing. And my beautiful young wife there, we were 20 Valentine's together. We had a great time except when I tweeted these pictures people said, oh, you had a good time with your daughter or is that your granddaughter?  WATTERS: Ouch.  RIVERA: That's exactly what I said. And I blocked them all. I blocked everyone of them.  GUTFELD: It is a good feeling to block.  RIVERA: That's -- really it's such power. But you know what, Trump can't block people.  GUTFELD: Oh, that's right.  PERINO: It's not allowed.  GUTFELD: It's illegal.  RIVERA: But I do.  GUTFELD: People tweet it you and insult somebody on your show, and then you block them and they go, why did you do that? I go, well, why don't -- why are you insulting people I work with?  PERINO: No, I wouldn't do that.  WATTERS: Who insulted who, Greg?  GUTFELD: Well, I'm not going to get into that.  WATTERS: Was it me?  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: That happened today, actually, to Johanna Maska. And I'm going to go block that person right now.  GUTFELD: Yes. they go like, why did you block me? Because you're being very rude.  WATTERS: You don't need to block people on my behalf, OK? I can handle it.  RIVERA: Any snarly people, I block them.  PERINO: No one would ever insult you, Jesse.  GUTFELD: I would never -- you know who I wouldn't block under any situation?  Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

72,FOX,"Can the former president mend a divided party? Reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" February 19, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Well, it's still early. That's a whole other show, a whole other discussion. Guys, I want to thank you both very, very much, the big debate tonight, ""THE FIVE"" now.  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Hello, everybody. I'm Jesse Watters, along with Emily Compagno, Geraldo Rivera, Dana Perino, and Greg. It is 5:00 in New York City, and this is THE FIVE. Is mini-Mike Bloomberg ready for an onslaught of attacks from his fellow Democrats? He will be stepping on to the debate stage for the first time tonight, where he won't be able to hide behind his million dollar ads and massive campaign apparatus. Democrats are sure to make Mike a top target.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  AMY KLOBUCHAR (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I actually thought he should be on the debate stage, because I don't think you should just be able to buy your way to the presidency.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you think Michael Bloomberg is trying to buy the Democratic nomination for president?  PETE BUTTIGIEG (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Yes, yes.  BERNIE SANDERS (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I do think it's a bit obscene that we have somebody who, by the way, chose not to contest in Iowa, in Nevada, in South Carolina. He said I don't have to do that. I'm worth $60 billion. I'll buy the presidency. That offends me very much.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: And President Trump's mixing it up with Bloomberg on Twitter. Quote, ""Is corrupt Bloomberg news going to say what a pathetic debater mini-Mike is, he doesn't respect our great farmers or that he has violated campaign finance laws at the highest and most sinister level with payoffs all over the place?"" Oh, and some breaking news, Michael Bloomberg will reportedly not, not be standing on a box during tonight's debate.  Dana, do you think his expectations for tonight's debate have been set at the correct level?  DANA PERINO, Fox News ANCHOR: Did you read my little piece here -- expectations for Bloomberg as a debater are very low.  (CROSSTALK)  GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: You just put your hand on it.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: So everybody who -- Geraldo knows him better than I do and I didn't live here when -- for that long when he was mayor. So I've never really seen him debate, and people have seen him in all of these ads. He's in all the ads. So I'm wondering, like, people who are kind of Bloomberg curious, when they see him tonight as a debater, will that match what they've been seeing in these very well produced, like, ads?  WATTERS: Well, he hasn't debated anybody in 10 years.  PERINO: Right. And also, like, these other people have been debating. And sort of you build up a little bit of a fighting form. But I guess -- I also think he's super confident. And I think the worst thing you can do is get up there and apologize for his whole life and all the policies. You should just tell them absolutely not.  Yes, I'm proud of that. Yes, we did. Yes, I did. And try to let it go. But the temptation for him to apologize will be pretty high.  WATTERS: Yeah. Does he apologize or does he just say, you know what, it was another time, another era. Let's move forward.  RIVERA: I will be Bloomberg. I apologize for making New York the safest big city on Earth. I apologize for picking up the garbage. I apologize for shoveling the snow. I apologize for getting the homeless off the streets. I apologize for making this a working city. That's what I apologize for. Now, he had accesses from time to time in terms of the strategies that we use.  I'm sorry for it. But ladies and gentlemen, the people -- I submit to you the -- made most safe was the lives were improved the most for the same poor people that you profess --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: How does he defend buying the election allegation?  RIVERA: Hey, you know, he made $60 billion, $60 billion. It didn't happen by luck. It happened -- he's a scrappy guy from nowhere. He goes and he puts together a company that employs tens of thousands of people around the globe. How many of the people on that stage have ever created one job for a person? These people on the stage like Bernie Sanders.  He never worked for a day in a private company in his life. Maybe he delivered newspapers as a kid. I doubt it. It was maybe the communist manifesto.  WATTERS: And he could also say I'm beholden to any special interests. I'm paying my own way through.  EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Exactly, especially given his background, too, that he certainly touched every corner so it's not like he has to have some type of consistent record -- his allegiance to one party over another. I think his natural public demeanor is not combative. Obviously, we've seen him kind of trading barbs with Trump on Twitter and etcetera.  But remember in the 2009 mayoral election, in those debates the New York Times said he has the ferocity of a bulldog. So I think tonight he's going to come out swinging. And on the flip side, we know that Biden, Mayor Pete, and Klobuchar, they need him to fall, because they would be the alternative mainstream candidate to Bernie obviously surging.  And I think that to both of your guys' point, the only way, you know -- explaining controversial statements is losing. So yes, he needs to have a proactive, positive spin on the past. Final point, Hillary Clinton's former advisor, Philippe Reines, said his only advice to Bloomberg is don't go.  (CROSSTALK)  ATTERS: He's doing well by not going so far. Philippe Reines has a point. Greg, now I guess Bloomberg's saying, you know, all of you non-Bernie people need to get out of the race. Clear the field so I can go head-to- head with Bernie.  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Yeah. If Sanders actually says to him you can't buy an election, Bloomberg should say if you become president, we won't be able to buy anything. Because to your point, Geraldo, you're absolutely right. He -- like, Sanders has produced nothing. Instead, he's lived off the producers as a politician for most of his life.  I do think that Bloomberg is going to spend the majority of his time explaining the context of every out of context outrage, whether it's stop and frisk or the thing about minorities in the workplace, the farming -- he's going to have to say this is what I meant. This is what I meant. But the big news, the news that I love, is that NBC had to tweet out that Bloomberg will not be standing on a box, OK?  So think about this as yet another example of where Trump had created a visual that then sticks and takes a life of its own. Basically, Trump is a news magician, right? He's a -- he brings up the box and now the box has to be answered to. You have to talk about the box. And it's actually -- it's - - he's the Harry Potter of persuasion.  He just comes up with this stuff. I think everybody is also pulling for Bloomberg, because, man, he's making some serious money for all of us. He is - his political advertising is breaking revenue records for a lot of companies. He is the reverse Trump. Like, you know, Bloomberg paid full price for the suit that Trump got wholesale off the back of a truck.  Think of all that free media Trump got. And now Bloomberg for the next eight months is going to paying full price. We are all going to get third homes.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: Greg, you could also say --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: I'm buying the election with my own money. Bernie is buying it with everyone else's money. You're all going to pay --  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: Bloomberg is the only one who can beat Trump.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: I think you're probably right.  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: Two New Yorkers -- you know, the fact I love Trump. I like Bloomberg. I -- it's great seeing two guys that I watch in action evolving and becoming who they are.  WATTERS: So Geraldo, but his whole, I guess, central message for the campaign is electability, right?  RIVERA: Yes.  WATTERS: I am the only one that could beat Donald Trump. That was Biden's message and that doesn't really --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: Why is Bloomberg's different, just because he's loaded?  RIVERA: Biden has never won an -- as far as I know, unless he won something in junior high school. I don't know that Biden has every won an election. All I know is that every time he's run for president, it's just - - Iowa wasn't an --  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: But I -- you know, I don't know about the --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Can I repeat myself that I said three times?  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: None of Bloomberg's infractions come close to what Sanders has said during the time of the USSR. I don't know how nobody calls him on this stuff about the fact that he was praising a totalitarian dictatorship during the Cold War? Why isn't that a story? Is it because everybody's too young?  WATTERS: They're afraid of the Bernie bros, Greg.  RIVERA: Kids love commies.  WATTERS: I mean, let's --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: Well, he's got the commie vote locked down. All right, coming up, President Trump taking on big liberal cities ahead of his rally tonight, see that next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  RIVERA: President Trump getting ready to host another big rally tonight, this one in Phoenix, Arizona. He's been out west this week contrasting his law and order agenda to the permissive policies of most big cities, the president, for instance demanding a fix to the homeless crisis cascading in California.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: You have needles. You have things that we don't want to discuss all over the streets flowing into the oceans. And you have beaches, and if they can't do it themselves, we're going to do it.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  RIVERA: Meanwhile, the Justice Department calling out self-styled social justice district attorneys as outrage grows over New York City's bail reform. A serial New York City subway thief who recently thanked Democrats for keeping him out of jail just got arrested for the 141st time. Now, Emily, I like bail reform. I like the fact that there is equity now.  But the system really has led to excesses that are untenable, it seems to me. You know, people arrested 141 times lose confidence in the system, liberal policies. And we want the president of the United States to have criminal justice reform. But liberal policies seem to be ricocheting.  COMPAGNO: I agree with you. There is no equity in being arrested 141 times. There is no justice in having our tax dollars be squandered and wasted and having cops put their lives on the line every time, because is it the 141st or the 142nd time of arrest. That's going to get the crop shot? I mean, all of that is ridiculous.  And I think that criminal justice reform is separate from bail reform. It's separate from -- in this particular state, my two issues with it, which I've said before are the crime classifications themselves and a lack of judicial discretion. So unlike other states, here, the classifications matter. So this particular new set of reform applies to a lot of crimes or excludes a lot of crimes that we would be horrified by like violent crimes against children.  But because of their classification, it doesn't count here, and those guys are on the streets. Secondly, removes judicial discretion. So a normal, reasonable person like yourself, as a judge, you can say. You know what? This guy -- I'm going to keep this guy locked up. This law remove that. This reform removes that ability by the judge, unlike in New Jersey.  So yes, I think the whole point is for all of us who are advocates for commonsense criminal justice reform. This is not that. Not by a long shot.  RIVERA: It's an excellent point. So here you have a situation where Giuliani, Bloomberg. I think of them as one administration, 5 terms, 20 years in New York. When they started in the early 90s, we were at over 2,000 murders a year. When they ended, you know, before de Blasio took over, they were around 400, so from over 2,000 to under 400.  That was the period where they went after the squeegee men, you know? Maybe you are too young to remember, the guys who wash the windows.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: That's what I did before I came to Fox.  RIVERA: And the homeless, you know, they got them off the streets. And I remember saying don't give the beggars money, because you only incur -- you know, sometimes -- I hate that Bloomberg is going to apologize for what worked in New York. That's my point.  WATTERS: Yeah. So Democrats and Republicans both agree. Rudy cleaned up Times Square and Bill Bratton cleaned up skid row in the mid-2000s. In Los Angeles, and they did that through broken windows policing, you know? You don't let small infractions slide and it improves the quality of life. But if you have pandering liberal politicians and you have civil rights litigation that allows people to smoke crystal meth on the streets, to live on the streets.  To prostitute themselves in open daylight and to relieve themselves in open daylight, that destroys the quality of life. And now in New York, have criminals committing crimes and than thinking Democrat politicians for letting them out of jail so they can commit more crimes. So the president should come out this from a compassionate approach.  And that puts Democrats on the defense, because they look like do-nothing politicians, and they look like they don't care about the environment if their backyards look like sewers.  RIVERA: Dana, Jesse's talking about counter-programming. Here you have the president of the United States going out to Phoenix, going out to the west coast at the same time the Democrats have their big debate in Nevada, obviously not an accident that he's going --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: It's super smart. It's super smart. And he said he'll do it in South Carolina. I don't know where -- how he'll be on every place in Super Tuesday, the night before Super Tuesday, but we'll see. Maybe he'll figure that out. You contrast what President Trump did when he went to Los Angeles to meet with the Olympic committee, because he wants America to be the host of the Olympics.  And he knows that what's happening in Los Angeles will definitely count against Los Angeles, which is probably a long shot anyway. But think about it. President Trump went to Los Angeles to try to clean that up, to try get us the Olympics. Remember when President Obama flew to Paris, like, or flew to Europe because it was his last ditch effort to try to get the Olympics in Chicago.  And they totally failed? It would be better -- I think it's better to try this approach, like, clean up the city and use this as a great reason for Los Angeles to be the wonderful host of the Olympics.  RIVERA: But is it sincerity that drives him or is that he's --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: I think so. No, I think he wants to win. I think he wants America to get the Olympics in 2024, sure.  RIVERA: You're from California.  GUTFELD: Yes, I am, sir.  RIVERA: So most of the homeless are in California.  GUTFELD: Yes.  RIVERA: I mean, isn't that a function of weather --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Sometimes. But we have a homeless problem here. And I think, you know, we talk about --  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: Here we house the homeless. We house the homeless.  GUTFELD: Not where I live.  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: Four percent are un-housed. In California, 70 percent are un- housed.  GUTFELD: But here's why the viewers at home should care, because right now we are talking about New York and California. These are signs of things that will come to America if you elect somebody like Bernie or Liz. Because what happens is any kind of effort to solve homelessness or to solve crime in the liberal vain will be portrayed as intolerant and punishing.  And oh, my god, you don't care for these people. Bail reform right now in New York City is catch and release for criminals. And the media calls the evidence of this anecdotal. No, it is statistical don't lie. Statistics don't lie. We are seeing 30, 40 percent jumps and a lot of crime, because they are going out and they are blatantly committing more crimes.  And we have to remember to this point. This is a cycle of degradation. Whenever Republicans come in, like whether it's Giuliani or Bloomberg and rebuild the city, it allows somebody like the de Blasio to degrade it. Because then you can start trying all these new things like bail reform, because crime has dropped. And then what happens the degradation increases again, and then you got to get another Republican. So it's a cycle that keeps happening --  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: What do you do with the homeless? What do you do with them?  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: I got homeless everywhere. What do I do with them?  GUTFELD: Very simple.  RIVERA: Put them on a bus to Phoenix?  GUTFELD: No, you move them out to a government-owned area. You set up sanitation. You counselors in there, you separate the --  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: So you would arrest people who are --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: You're playing the game.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: You're playing the game.  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: I want to know what you do.  GUTFELD: I'm trying to tell you.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: No, because you keep interrupting me. One, you separate the mentally ill from the non-mentally ill, the people who are drug addicted from the drug addicted -- from the non-drug addicted.  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: You're going to be the separator?  GUTFELD: No. You hire people to do it. So you're playing the game of life.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Oh, you hate the homeless. No, the only way you could solve the problem is through tough love. To get there -- out of underneath the underpasses, get them to an area, and then get them treated.  RIVERA: Tough love to work the majority has to support it. And I believe - -  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: -- has an opportunity to rally the majority so that the era of tough love that happened here can happen everywhere. Up next, can the surging Bernie Sanders be stopped? Some in the media are not happy with his rise.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PERINO: Bernie Sanders building momentum in the Democratic Party -- primary, excuse me. The candidates jumping out to a very commanding lead in a brand-new national poll, Sanders also surging in other key primary states like California and his rise is not sitting well with some in the media.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I hope that the candidates who have been telegraphing their punches against Sanders, Senator Sanders, are actually going to deliver them. Nobody just says the obvious. Bernie, you are full of it.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's time to stop grading Bernie Sanders on a curve and start asking what the country would look like if he would have become president.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't see how Democrats do anything but bleed out their newfound support in the suburbs when they put a socialist at the top of the ticket.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: And Sanders supporters trying to dismiss concerns about socialism.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is not the Cold War anymore. When people talk about a Democratic socialism, from which I think also could be called social democracy, something I do align with. What it means is that we have a society that's fair to people. There are a lot of Americans who are not hung up on the label. They actually are much more interested in what do you stand for and have you been on the right side of these big issues?  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He's always fought for the issues that I think the Democratic Party is now starting to catch up to. And so ultimately, it comes down to what the policies are more than what you call yourself.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  COMPAGNO: Greg, I have a question. So why are -- why is the media surprised that this would be the result of Bernie Sanders? Like, for example, Medicare for all is like single-payer. It just sounds better.  GUTFELD: I'll tell you why, because they wasted -- OK, it's all Adam Schiff's fault. They wasted so much time on impeachment that they drained all the intellectual energy from the party and the media, who got so lustful over this impeachment fantasy, that now they are stuck with Bernie- geddon, right? It's like Armageddon? So there's no way out for the Dems.  If you nominate him, Trump gets 49 states, as Chris Matthews says. If you get a brokered convention of Bloomberg buys the election, you're going to have an excitable base go crazy. So it's basically you have two meals on the menu, one is manure, the other is compost. Either way you look at it, it's crap.  WATTERS: Sounds yummy.  PERINO: Would you like fries with that?  RIVERA: Yes, fries. I hope it is fries.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: -- like, in 2016 when Bernie Sanders eventually lost to Hillary Clinton, they didn't spend the next four years figuring out how could they then remake themselves as a party. They spent four years trying to figure out why she didn't go into Wisconsin.  WATTERS: Yeah. I mean, they focused on the wrong things. I think Greg's point is very smart about the impeachment. They botched it and now he just slid under the radar. Bernie is going to get stopped. It's just a matter of by whom and when. The polling on socialism is downright scary. Democratic voters themselves would rather vote for a lesbian Muslim who just had a heart attack than vote for a socialist.  PERINO: Let's pull up this poll. So this was -- they asked them what are the things that would make you uncomfortable or you would have reservations about? Socialism is one of them, having a heart attack or a -- in the past years, if they were older, a socialist --  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: You skipped just with over 75 plus.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: I said it. I said 75 years. But I just feel like it is true. Like, everybody ages at a different rate, but 75 plus is different than it was 20 years ago.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: It's a bad label. And that's why they are pushing back so hard because they're fighting a two front war. The Republicans are hammering them and then they are fighting a rear guard reaction on their left. But Bernie's base is about 30 percent and growing. He's winning in all demographic. He's winning head-to-head against all the other top three contenders.  So at this point, you have to think to yourself, is he really going to get specific about socialism, because all you have to ask is does socialism work and how, and how are you going to pay for it? And the answer is it doesn't work. And you can't pay for it. And that's why he paints with such broad strokes, because once you govern, you can't get in there and start banning fracking, banning AR-15s.  There is going to be a run on the dollar, you know? Everyone is going to get their money out of the country. And there's going to be gasoline twice as much. Greg, we'll have to not -- we will have to buy make an electric car.  GUTFELD: That'll never happen.  RIVERA: On the other hand, AOC is the most attractive and compelling new public official in memory. She has an amazing job in capturing the imagination of the --  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: -- as a philosophy. You know optimism. We're all in this together. I think that there is potency there. The messenger, though, and I think that Greg is onto something when he says what about Nicaragua, what about Moscow, what about when it's being revealed that he's the enemy of our, you know, of the American dream.  But there is still real potency in the single-payer Medicare -- every person in America with access to healthcare, every person in America with access to public education. These are wonderful, wonderful aspirations for a country to have. And to minimize it because he's a nut job with a crazy hairdo, I think is --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: Let's take a listen to one of his supporters, Emily. This is the guy, Kshama Sawant, talking about why we need Bernie.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We need to have Bernie and we need a new party of by and for working people. We need a powerful socialist movement to end all capitalist oppression and exploitation.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: And Emily, you're from Seattle where she's a city councilwoman.  COMPAGNO: I live there. Yes, exactly. And, you know, there was a an internal race against her where a lot of people in Seattle who are massively and clearly unhappy with that socialist regime we're trying to -- trying to get this entire wave of resistance essentially to her and it just didn't work, and she was -- she was reelected.  And to your point, Geraldo, you said, you know, when it -- when it becomes revealed that he is the enemy of the American dream, it's clearly shocking all of us. It's already revealed. His statements belie themselves. It's totally obvious with everything that he says. But to your point earlier, Greg.  GUTFELD: Yes.  COMPAGNO: When is that going to receive any attention or when would these voters who are all 19 and ridiculous really understand what's going on. And you know, 538 predicts by the way that by March 3rd, he will have 41 percent of the delegates, and then Bloomberg and Biden 18. And I think it's important to point out that right now obviously, like it's not overwhelming yet. He's just the clear front runner. And then it looks like Bloomberg is who is closest to chasing him, but --  PERINO: We'll see tonight if that can pan out. All right, next on THE FIVE, Mayor Pete Buttigieg lashes out against Trump supporters.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  COMPAGNO: News smears against Trump supporters from the 2020 Democrats. Here's Mayor Pete Buttigieg trashing Christians who support the president. Take a listen.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  PETE BUTTIGIEG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm not going to tell other Christians how to be Christians. But I will say, I cannot find any compatibility between the way this president conducts himself and anything that I find in Scripture.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  COMPAGNO: And Joe Biden continues to try to stir up tension.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  NICOLLE WALLACE, ANCHOR, MSNBC: I'm asking if you think Bernie Sanders is acting Trump-like and his refusal to disavow people that may be unsavory, but that are very enthusiastic about him?  JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, by the way, the white supremacists are very enthusiastic about Trump.  WALLACE: Right.  BIDEN: It's not whether they're enthusiastic about him, it's the things they do.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  COMPAGNO: Dana, how dangerous are those comments by Mayor Pete to his campaign?  PERINO: Well, remember, like, who his audiences right now is the -- are the Democratic primary voters and so they are aghast that Christian evangelicals would actually support President Trump and they can't understand it. And they constantly are asking and writing articles over and over again about how could this possibly be, and they won't accept the answer.  But the other thing is, to me -- well, if it's dangerous, I don't know for him in the long run. But the great thing about Christianity is that it's not for us to judge. Like it's not our job. There's somebody else in charge of that. So you could just stop it at that sentence by saying, I'm not going to tell other Christians how to be Christians, period.  COMPAGNO: Jesse, are those comments by Biden just another indication that he's stuck in 2016 or like 1916?  WATTERS: I don't like that game that politicians play where they say you have to disavow these people and then you have to -- because all it is, is the democrats make Republicans disavow their own people. And then if you ever point out anything on their side, they act like nothing happened.  But with regard to Pete, he's barking up the wrong tree. He has his own issues with Christian compatibility that he needs to pay attention to within his own party before he starts pointing fingers.  RIVERA: Like what?  WATTERS: Well, I think it's clear that African Americans have a little doubt about whether they'd vote for him based on his lifestyle, but that's not my issue. My issue is when he says that Christians --  RIVERA: That's a pretty big ---  WATTERS: -- no, when he says Christians have to separate what they see from Trump with Scripture, Trump is the biggest crusader for the values that Christians hold dear in the culture war. He's the biggest culture warrior we've had in a long time talking about not kneeling for the flag, appointing pro-life judges, he says Merry Christmas. Remember he brings that back.  But if you look at the Democrats, he's fighting a war against them who were there trying to what, sue nuns over ObamaCare, try to boot the pledge out of schools, and, you know, partial-birth abortion. So I think Christians know Trump is not a born again, you know, evangelical. They see him for what he is, and they appreciate the things he fights for, not what he does in his free time.  COMPAGNO: Greg, you had some thoughts on the Biden comments?  GUTFELD: Well, yes. I mean, I've been fairly nice to him, but I think he's a pathetic, dim-witted loser.  WATTERS: Oh, no.  GUTFELD: He's a fumbling -- he's fumbling feeble dolt who needs to go because that was a fatal error what he did. What he did was he smear Trump supporters using the extremist contamination ploy, like, oh, the white supremacist is going to be happy. So we want you to think that anybody that supports Trump is somehow shares those same intentions.  Never mind, Joe, that Trump has done more for minorities than you ever have. He's done stuff for black colleges. He's done stuff for jobs and wages and prison reform. Joe, what do you do? You point to Barack and you say hey, that's my black friend. That's all you do. So I'm sorry.  When Trump breaks records with the black vote, someone should weal Joe out and show him the facts and then he can -- he can -- in his stupor, they can ask him for a comment, because that was garbage. And them chuckling over, what a bunch of jackasses.  COMPAGNO: Geraldo, I wanted to get your thoughts on actually on Amy Klobuchar which is also on our 2020 radar. She was getting mocked after saying this to Hispanic voters. Take a listen.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: So let me tell you about me. My name is Amy. And when I took Spanish in fourth grade, my name was Elena. They gave me the name (INAUDIBLE) because I couldn't roll my R's very well. And so, with E-L-E-A --  (END VIDEO CLIP)  COMPAGNO: Is that Hispandering or just fumbling?  RIVERA: You know, Hispandering is a great title. I just want to say briefly that I think that Biden is guilty of the -- of what I see very commonly the ask a Democrat, do you think all Republicans are racist? And too many of them hesitate before they reluctantly say, no. So that's -- let's put that.  In terms of the Hispanic vote, I think that this is a vote that's up for grabs. The President has in this harsh language about immigration left an opening for the Democrats to expand that base. I urge him, I talked to him personally, speak with compassion about this population. This is a population that you can -- these are entrepreneurial people, faith-based people, family-oriented people. These people could be Republicans, as George W. Bush famously said.  So I want the president to be much more expansive and much kinder when it comes to that whole border issue. You can build the damn wall. I don't care about the wall as long as there's big doors. He says there's going to be a big door. I think that the President now has a historic opportunity to expand the Republican party in a way that we have not seen since Ronald Reagan in the second term.  This is -- this is huge, and he can do it. He's just the guy to do it. I see him working it in the African American community. I want to help him you know, to get that language -- that language to the DACA students the DREAM Act students. Let's -- these are people that you want to bring into the American dream. This is -- let's do this.  COMPAGNO: If those values are shared regardless then of nationality or country of origin, wouldn't they then be attractive to, as you were saying, the policies that have been furthered by Trump that have resulted in, for example, higher wages, achieving the American dream, faith-based judges, etcetera.  RIVERA: Yes, sure. But you got to be -- you know, sometimes you got to play to a certain crowd. It doesn't take a lot. Spanish people are very open. They're very -- you know, they love to be loved. And I don't think it's that difficult for the President to do. He has just the personality to do it.  COMPAGNO: I love to be loved too.  RIVERA: OK.  COMPAGNO: All right, coming up next -- yes, the latest examples of liberal intolerance on America's college campuses.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: So it's safe spaces spread throughout our college campuses, are such places getting any safer? Not from the walking brain dead that's for sure. A new study shows that as badly educated far-left activists continue to label words as violence and ideas is not wrong but evil. They've helped turn arenas of free thought into monuments to the East German secret police.  The new study found that a quarter and students believe you can silence views that they don't like and it's OK to obstruct the speakers in order to do so. Six times as many liberals felt that way as non-libs. And while nearly all conservatives said that they would be friends with a liberal, a large minority of libs wouldn't reciprocate.  No wonder 70 percent of conservatives fear expressing their views in class. So this is where you send your kids not to be educated, but to be indebted. No longer to engage, but to punish each other. It's a place where its gatekeepers realize the only way to preserve their bad ideas is to enlist zombie students to cooperate against their rebellious peers, like guards in a prison camp.  Does this help shape young minds? Well, if those mines can be found, they can certainly be shaped into what, one wonders.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  CROWD: Shut it down. Shut it down. Shut it down.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Slash his throat. Every (BLEEP) Republican. Slash Republicans' throats. Slash fascist throats. Death to fascists.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Why the (BLEEP) did you accept the position? Who the (BLEEP) hired you?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have a different vision than you.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You should step down. You should not sleep at night. You are disgusting.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Are those healthy minds? Are they people you can work with upon graduation? Hell no. You don't want to be around that. To them community, empathy, skepticism, nonconformity, and free thought are oppressive. Where once parents sent their kids to college to be educated, now they're sending them to be institutionalized. It's a cuckoo's nest and the lunatics are coming for you. All right, Geraldo, you were -- you were a young dude in the 60s.  RIVERA: I was.  GUTFELD: Is this different? Are these like -- was there more intelligence?  RIVERA: It was pretty rough in the 60s.  GUTFELD: But, I mean --  RIVERA: And it was pretty intolerant on the left.  GUTFELD: But are they crazy people like that?  RIVERA: I think it sticks out more because we've had -- we've had a couple of decades of gentility so we're shocked. But it was pretty raw during Vietnam and the end of civil rights. It was pretty raw.  GUTFELD: But you could talk to people.  RIVERA: To racial thing was pretty raw. I just want to say that the only thing more difficult socially than being a conservative is being a moderate these days. I call myself roadkill. I get it from the left, I get it from the right. And our old boss Roger Ailes used to say, the only thing in the middle of the road is roadkill. So I'm a roadkill. That's what it's like.  GUTFELD: But you're a handsome roadkill, Geraldo.  RIVERA: I am dashing.  WATTERS: You got some -- you got some roadkill right on your lip.  GUTFELD: Emily, are colleges a lost cause for free thought? Can we just create our own?  COMPAGNO: Maybe. Yes, I mean, (INAUDIBLE) certainly did. I hope not, though. And I grew up without social media, without the Internet.  GUTFELD: Are you Amish?  COMPAGNO: I'm older than I look. And growing up -- you know, I grew up in the Bay Area in Berkeley, and my teachers, everybody, they were all, you know, still practicing hippies from the 60s. And they totally fostered my then goals of being an Air Force fighter pilot, and I loved all that stuff. And I felt like this just makes me so sad to see especially in Berkeley, because I grew up in such a different environment, even though all around me were people who felt so differently, I was still supported.  GUTFELD: That's true.  COMPAGNO: And in law school, as president of the Federalist Society in San Francisco where my whole role was bringing the other view to debates, I never got any crap for it. It was -- it was all supported. And I'm not trying to paint this rosy existence, but just that that was our reality. My best friend from home goes to a revolutionary meeting every Sunday, and it's all fine.  But now for some reason, I don't know if it's the amplification from social media, or the different times, whatever it is, but it certainly doesn't feel like it used to.  GUTFELD: Dana, you were in the Weather Underground. A lot of people don't know that. But no, but --  PERINO: I'm so short.  GUTFELD: I think -- so short. Emily brings --  RIVERA: I don't think there's a height requirement.  GUTFELD: I don't know. But that it's -- it used to be you could actually have a conversation. Is it because of the -- I think it's the identity politics and the intersectionality has created an oppressor versus oppressed.  PERINO: Add social media to the mix and that it's very combustible, and then it's also viral so then we all see it. I have friends whose kids are getting ready to go to college and there -- they really are at a loss. They don't know what to do. They're super worried about it. They want their kids to be able to do -- go to a good place.  It's interesting, though, because the increase in tuition, you could almost track with the increase of these incidents.  GUTFELD: Oh, that's true.  PERINO: But there's a place like Purdue University where former Governor Mitch Daniels is a president. They just announced, I think was yesterday, their ninth consecutive tuition freeze.  GUTFELD: Wow.  PERINO: So -- and there's like using free-market principles like figure it out a way to do something really smart. And there are universities like that, but they're the exception.  GUTFELD: Well, I'm going to start buying their chicken.  PERINO: That's a good idea.  GUTFELD: So, Jesse, you have daughters that are going to be in about a decade college-bound. Are you going -- is this going to bother you or are you going to homeschool?  WATTERS: I better start saving up. I'm in a homeschool, Greg. I can barely take care of myself. No, I have liberal friends and I have conservative friends. And it's great because when we all get together, we all just make fun of the liberals.  PERINO: Yes.  WATTERS: And that's what being in college is about. You have a few drinks and then you bust the chops of people you disagree with and it sharpens your skills. And then if you're data conservative, it's great too because then they can just pay for dinner.  RIVERA: But it is interesting because hard times do make people more tolerant.  COMPAGNO: But it's such -- it's such a luxury for these kids to be screaming in that courtyard.  GUTFELD: Yes. When you have -- when you don't have war, you create your own. All right, ""ONE MORE THING"" is up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WATTERS: It's time now for ""ONE MORE THING."" I'll go first we have a feeding frenzy.  GUTFELD: Look at that.  WATTERS: So everybody likes ice cream and we also like the Cheesecake Factory. Now, we can combine the two into this delicious premium cheesecake ice cream extravaganza. We have birthday cake, chocolate cookies and cream, key lime original, salted caramel strawberry. They basically combined ice cream with a piece of cake, and here are the results. I'm going to try some of this salted caramel.  COMPAGNO: This cheesecake flavor and it was delicious.  RIVERA: Oh yes.  WATTERS: That's so good.  COMPAGNO: I'm going to try the birthday cake.  WATTERS: That is.  GUTFELD: This is offensive.  WATTERS: I don't always tell the truth with the food court stuff or with the feeding frenzy, but I'm going to tell you which one --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: Some of it is fake news. This is the real deal. So go to the CheesecakeFactoryathome.com to check out where your local Cheesecake Factory is to get some ice cream.  GUTFELD: They had the world's biggest menus. You know, they're like fashion models, you can't pick it up.  WATTERS: Greg, you don't go there, but --  GUTFELD: No, I go there when I'm on the road. I go there when I'm -- but this is -- this is lactose intolerant intolerance.  WATTERS: OK.  GUTFELD: Because people like me can't -- I'm moving along.  WATTERS: I'm playing a little bit more.  GUTFELD: I'm plugging my podcast. All right, if you go to Fox Newspodcast.com, is that what it is? Or just go to my -- I have a great interview with Jeff Rohrer. He was a former NFL linebacker, Dallas Cowboys. The only football player in history to marry a man. And he painted that picture of me. See that? So it's a pretty wild interview.  PERINO: He's good.  GUTFELD: Go to Fox news.com podcast slash Hello, Greg, whatever. I don't know what it is.  PERINO: It isn't easy.  GUTFELD: It's not easy. They don't make it easy. Fox, come up with something simple. Podcast.com, how about that?  WATTERS: Dana.  PERINO: All right, so two off duty Kentucky police officers thwarted a robbery while they're on their date night. So this is Detective Chase McKeown and Officer Nicole McKeown. They are of the Elizabethtown Police Department. They've been married for six months. They're there in Louisville. They see this guy come in with a mask and flashes gun at the cashier.  And look at those amazing public servants and they just chased him right out of there, which is amazing. They drew their guns as they had the right to. And thank goodness that they were there to do it. The McKeowns caught the suspect. They held him until local police arrived on the scene.  GUTFELD: Did they leave a tip?  COMPAGNO: Dream date.  PERINO: And they were -- they were having a local fried chicken.  WATTERS: Where was this?  PERINO: In Louisville.  GUTFELD: Oh, fried chicken.  WATTERS: Nice. She's going to love that. All right, Geraldo.  RIVERA: I am outraged by the outrage that greeted the President's pardons today, the presidential pardons. They are forgiveness. They are showing mercy.  WATTERS: What did you do, Geraldo?  RIVERA: Michael Milken, the junk bond guy, one of the great philanthropist, Eddie DeBartolo Jr. five Super Bowls. I mean they committed their crimes, they -- but the two --  GUTFELD: Those really affected me the most.  RIVERA: They are pardoned by the President yesterday. Bernard Kerik, the police commissioner of New York City during 9/11, a hero to his core, a wonderful person, a guy who has just really been a pillar of strength. He went to jail for four years for nothing, for giving an underpriced home renovation. It was awful. And the other one that I really supported was Blagojevich, the -- Rod Blagojevich, the former Governor of Illinois.  WATTERS: There you go.  RIVERA: I ambushed him, but then I later became friends with him and he had some very nice things to say.  WATTERS: All right. Emily, take it home.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  ROD BLAGOJEVICH, FORMER GOVERNOR OF ILLINOIS: How do you probably thank someone who's giving you back the freedom that was stolen from you. He didn't have to do this. He's a Republican president. I was a Democratic governor. And doing this does nothing to help his --  WATTERS: Sorry, Emily. You're not the first or the last person to get big- footed by Geraldo.  COMPAGNO: Just really quickly. We're so glad that Ryan Newman, NASCAR racer is out of the hospital. Prayers were answered. Prayers continue for him in his recovery.  WATTERS: Yes, we are. All right.

74,FOX,"The Trump economy is so great that Trump haters want to take credit for it. After former President Barack Obama claimed credit for America's economic boom, President Trump fired back, saying the boom is due to rolling back Obama's policies and cutting regulations and taxes. So who's right? Who even cares? Think about it. The debate we're having isn't over how great things are. That ship has sailed. The media and Democrats see there's no more denying the success. It's now about quibbling over credit. Fine. Let the Democrats have it. It won't win them an election. But it might reduce their tears. Maybe Obama did have something to do with today's economy. I mean, without Obama, would we have Trump? TRUMP CAMPAIGN FIRES BACK AFTER OBAMA CLAIMS CREDIT FOR ECONOMIC BOOM The fact is that this debate says a lot about life today. The Trump economy is so great that Trump haters now want credit for it. Next thing you know, Obama will claim credit for putting kids in cages. Why not? He did do it before Trump. So it's confusing. In the Democrats' world, Obama isn't responsible for his results, only for the success of whoever came next. Technically, then, President George W. Bush was responsible for Obama's success. And of course, without Bush's dad, we'd have no President Clinton. Couldn't you do this forever? Who gets credit for George Washington's success? King George III, of course.

75,FOX,"Trump commutes Rod Blagojevich's sentence, pardons Bernie Kerik; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" February 18, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: So the markets are panicking and panicking is relevant. The DOW down about 165 points -- hadn't been down almost 300. We survive. We always do. More now.  REG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: I'm Greg Gutfeld with Emily Compagno, Donna Brazile, Jesse Watters, and she's never been told to duck, Dana Perino, THE FIVE, clever one. So after former President Obama claimed credit for our current economic boom yesterday, President Trump fired back, saying the boom is due to rolling back Obama's policies by cutting regulations and taxes.  So who is right? Who cares? Think about it. The debate we are having isn't over how great things are. That ship has sailed. The media and the Dems see there is no more denying the success, so now it's about quibbling over credit. Fine, let the Dems have it. It won't win the elections but it might reduce their tears. And maybe Obama had something to do with today's economy.  I mean, without Obama, would we have Trump? The fact is this debate says a lot about life today. The Trump economy is so great that Trump haters now want credit for it. Next thing you know Obama will claim credit for putting kids in cages, and why not? He did do it before Trump, so it's confusing. In the Dems' world, Obama is not responsible for his results, only for the success of whoever came next.  Technically then, George Bush was responsible for Obama's success. And, of course, without W's dad, we would have no bubba. Couldn't you do this forever? Who gets credit for George Washington's success, George the Third, of course. Then there are those who just want the economy to tank because their hatred for Trump outweighs their love for the country, and also impeachment failed.  So war erupts under Trump, a Twitter war. Like alot of the wars under Trump, non-violent, no body bags, just trash talk, and finger-pointing. I will take that over the other kind of wars any day. Just remember. If it hadn't been for smoke signals, there would be no Twitter. Maybe Liz Warren can take credit for that.  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Little giggle there.  GUTFELD: And you know, Jesse, welcome to the show.  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Thank you.  GUTFELD: Does Obama have a point about claiming credit?  WATTERS: I'd say you didn't build that, Barack. And then I would say this. Greg, you know when you date a girl then you guys break up and then she goes on to marry some other guy? You can't take credit for that. You can't take credit for that when you break up with her and then she gets re- married. That is not the point.  The point is this. The stimulus was a punchline during the Obama administration. He said so himself. Remember, he was actually joking. Those shovel-ready jobs aren't so shovel-ready. Think about it this way. The Democrats first said that the economy was going to tank under Trump. Then they said it was Barack Obama's economy. Then they said there was going to be a recession.  And then they said it was only benefiting the rich. And now, they are back to saying that it's Barack Obama's economy. It doesn't make any sense because they can't talk about the economy, because they haven't done anything to help the economy. If there had been a Democrat who had taken the reins in 2016, you would've had strangling Obamacare regulations, a Green New Deal, Paris climate deal, war on coal, no new trade deals, tax hikes instead of the cuts, no bonuses.  It would've been an absolute disaster. They can't name one single metric that has gotten worse when Trump came over and took over the Obama economy. Wages have gone up. Stock market has gone up. Manufacturing jobs up. Every job has gone up. They can't have a little fingerprint on any of this success. And the American people see that.  And that's why they're giving Donald Trump credit for the good economy. They are saying they're optimistic. And they say they're better off now than they were three years ago. And that's why I believe he's going to win re-election.  GUTFELD: Donna, I saw you nodding to everything Jesse said. I could tell you were going, yes.  WATTERS: She was nodding off.  DONNA BRAZILE, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, Greg, as you well know, I try to deal in fact and not make-believe. I don't try to make up things. And look, the truth is --  WATTERS: You mean the fairytale?  (CROSSTALK)  BRAZILE: -- Trump inherited a strong economy that Barack Obama really helped to build. We all know that when he took office, Barack Obama -- President Barack Obama, the economy was in a, quote, unquote, ""hole"". I wanted to use a S word, but you know what I'm saying, Greg.  PERINO: It's a deep hole.  BRAZILE: Deep hole. Thank you, Dana. And so we've gone from 10 percent unemployment to 4.7 percent when Barack Obama left office, it's now at 3.5 percent, hooray, 11 consecutive years of strong growth. I agree with your first line. We should be thankful that we have an economy that is working. But what Democrats are arguing for, Jesse, and I don't know if you talked to any Democrats.  And I'm so glad to be sitting next to you, at least once or twice a month. It beats anything else I do during the week. But what we are all excited about is that we want an economy that works for every American.  WATTERS: Did it work for every American during the Obama?  BRAZILE: Yes.  WATTERS: OK. So it worked for every American under Obama. And then how does that not work for every American under Trump when things are better?  BRAZILE: Things got better under Barack Obama. The stock market got better. Wages started going up. The number of uninsured Americans went down. Things got better under President Obama. Now, the fact that President Trump inherited a 4.7 unemployment rate -- remember, the stock market is one metric. But look at the most important metric, and that is wages. Wages began to go up under Barack Obama --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: But no. It jumps under Trump --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: I got to bring Emily -- Emily, thoughts.  (CROSSTALK)  BRAZILE: I also have graphs and maps, anything you need. But the truth is I'm excited that the number of people --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: I pulled Pelosi. You guys liked it when she did it.  BRAZILE: You know what, Jesse? You can shred it. It doesn't matter, because but what is important --  (CROSSTALK)  BRAZILE: -- this will hurt you.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Emily --  BRAZILE: You are really giving bad facts. Go ahead, Emily.  EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, to speak to your point about wages growing, absolutely. So in this administration, unlike the past administration, workers' wages have grown beyond managers' wages. And that's something that, as you pointed out, that all Americans should want to feel. What is so interesting about this conversation we're having right now is that Democrats are sending such mixed messages.  So by some, the economy is still horrible and the benefits have not been, in fact, felt by everyone, and then by others, no, it's amazing but this was started by Barack Obama, by then President Obama. And the reality is economic growth is driven by deregulation, and trade reform, and energy independence, and tax cuts.  And those are not things that the Democratic Party stands for, and that is not things that occurred under the Obama administration. And what is creating this stained wage increases is sustained job creation. And that's the result of that positive economic growth. And what I will continue say also is that for the Democratic Party that advocate for those that are unable to advocate for themselves.  Under this administration, not only have Asian-Americans, black-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, their wages have increased and unemployment rates decreased, but also those with only high school degrees. And so, for example, the 2020 candidates have been talking about wiping away college debt. I love that under this administration people don't need to go to college, because those with just high school degrees, their wages are increasing.  BRAZILE: When Trump -- when the president -- President Trump, I like to call people president, because he is my president.  GUTFELD: President Gutfeld?  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: I want to get Dana in this.  (CROSSTALK)  BRAZILE: Hold on. Hold on. President Trump's tax cuts went into effect one year after he took office. The unemployment rate went down from 4.7 to 4.1. All I'm saying is that we can give both presidents credit for a strong economy, and economy that is only --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Tear it up.  (CROSSTALK)  BRAZILE: -- the truth.  GUTFELD: Dana, what would happen if times were bad? Would Obama take credit for that? Hey, I'm going to tweet, you know what, it's bad, I feel bad, this is partly my fault.  PERINO: He would say, well, if you had only given me a third term then things would've been better. History has a very long sweep -- and so I think that the tweet that President Obama did yesterday was just so ill- advised. You should let other people say that for you. But the fact that he tweeted it means that we're leading our show with it and having this big debate the night before the Democrats debate on stage in Nevada.  And if you think about -- historical data points, that are facts, everybody has stated some good facts. But I think it's very interesting that President Obama and the House Republicans, everybody wanted to do a corporate tax cut. And Obama was at 27 percent. And the House Republicans were at 25 percent. And they could not come to a deal.  GUTFELD: Yeah.  PERINO: You got a cut -- 26 percent, let's do it. And then they would've been able to see a little bit more growth. But also don't forget, it wasn't just the tax cuts. It is the deregulation that has given people a chance to, like, open it up and make sure that you can hire more people and pay them more.  GUTFELD: So true.  (CROSSTALK)  BRAZILE: -- deficit.  GUTFELD: All right, I'm going to tease, OK? Stop yelling at me in my ear, crazy person. Up next, Bloomberg better get ready. Democrats are preparing to go after him during the debate tomorrow.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  BRAZILE: Always Aretha. Get your popcorn ready. Michael Bloomberg has qualified for the next Democratic debate. I am so excited. I cannot go home -- I cannot wait to go home and pop my popcorn. Put some Cajun seasoning. Now, this comes after a new national poll show the former mayor in second place. And Bloomberg rivals say they can't wait to go after him.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JOE BIDEN: (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Michael Bloomberg, with $62 billion, can buy every ad he wants. But he can't, in fact, wipe away his record. I'm looking forward to debating Michael Bloomberg.  BERNIE SANDERS (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He does not have a right to buy the presidency. Especially after being mayor of New York and having a racist, stop and frisk policy.  ELIZABETH WARREN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Michael Bloomberg, to blame the inability of the banks to continue to discriminate against people, is outrageous.  BRAZILE: Wow. Now, President Trump is taunting Michael Bloomberg on Twitter, saying, remember no standing on boxes? Mr. President, come on. James Madison was short. Mr. Tapper was short. And you know Abraham Lincoln was the tallest president. I know because I fell in love with him at a young age.  GUTFELD: What a waste of time.  (CROSSTALK)  BRAZILE: The man did a good job, OK?  GUTFELD: Yeah.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: We have different tastes, Donna. Let's be clear.  BRAZILE: I thought my grandmother -- I really thought my grandmother was in love with him, too. So look, do you think, Dana that Mr. Bloomberg can connect with voters outside of this big ad buy?  PERINO: And outside of New York City?  BRAZILE: Yeah.  PERINO: Yeah. It remains to be seen. I will be watching, too. I'm not going to put Cajun spice on. But -- these national polls that show him with the ability to get into the top two, they used to be not considered that important. But then we started linking the national poll numbers to your qualification for a debate. So he has, as Biden said, he has been able to buy his way into this moment.  And until now, except for a few interviews here and there, all people have really ever heard from Joe -- Michael Bloomberg is from the ads that they have seen and also maybe hearing us talk about him. So he is 77 years old. He is a billionaire. He is used to getting his own way. Can he, tomorrow night, show that he could be a uniter and somebody that can really convince Democrats of the progressive base that this former Republican who was the mayor of New York City and doesn't really care that much about flyover country.  Can he do that? Now, he might be able to do a little bit better than we think just because he will be new, and also because everyone will be piling on him. It will just elevate him.  BRAZILE: He has some vulnerabilities, including on race and gender. What do you think Michael Bloomberg's chances are in terms of being able to appeal to a much deeper audience once he is in Nevada?  COMPAGNO: Well, I think it depends on how he performs on the debate stage with what he focuses on. So if he gets down in the weeds with any type of attack that's levied toward him, then I think that is when his stock will start to fall. But the reality is that he outspent all of the other candidates by over 10 times.  And we just saw it in the last two months, the national PBS poll, that he went from 4 percent to 19, to number two nationally. So for everyone saying he can't buy his way into it. That is what he is doing. And clearly, those ads are effective for some way, let alone the millions and millions that his nonprofits pour into affecting and shaping this country, especially in the judiciary.  So I think, again, depending on that debate stage, the questions and the Achilles heels that are thrown his way, how he responds will be the first measure that the public will see beyond those ads.  BRAZILE: But I got to ask this since you tore up my paper. You also tore I up the one -- I had a question for you.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: My mom actually just texted me. She says tearing that up was inexcusable, obnoxious, and beyond wretched, as well as utterly disrespectful behavior. Apologize. So I will apologize when Nancy apologizes.  (CROSSTALK)  BRAZILE: You know you should listen to your mother.  (CROSSTALK)  BRAZILE: Look, let me ask you a question. I mean, Michael Bloomberg is going to come under a lot of fire.  GUTFELD: Yeah.  BRAZILE: Not just from stop and frisk. But at a time when the Democrats are debating income inequality, Greg, what advice would you give him to, you know, take on Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and others?  GUTFELD: I think he is doing exactly what he is doing. He's buying the election. He's getting endorsements from people he gave money to, Stacey Abrams, right? She said nice things, why, because, what, $5 million went into her campaign. So what's interesting to me is why everybody in the media is OK with him buying the election.  It's the same reason they bought Avenatti, because the overreaching aim is to beat Trump, so they will adjust their principles and say they used to tell us and lecture us. You can't buy an election. Well, unless you can beat Trump. So they are adjusting their principles kind of the same way you can say the evangelicals adjusted their principles with Trump, which is fine.  Because you want to win, if you think he is going to win. But if Bloomberg gets the nomination, what happens to the Sanders people. Because they are supporting Bernie not to beat Trump, they're supporting Bernie to support Bernie. So they're not buying into this. We need to beat Trump. They are into we like this guy. Meanwhile, everybody else is we need Trump out and it could be anyone.  So you can see that the passion is more on Bernie's side. But with Bernie, it's like choosing the way you are going to be executed. If he is nominated, you got a socialist. If he's not nominated, you got chaos in your own party. So I think the Democrats might be so screwed right now. They should be thinking about 2024.  BRAZILE: Well, let's talk about 2020. Michael Bloomberg has the resources to take on Donald Trump, Jesse. And I do believe that if he becomes the nominee, he will be able to unite a fractured party to really win the Electoral College. I'm giving you a big one.  WATTERS: I don't believe Bloomberg is going to unite them. He's not running his money. If you separate Mike from his money, he doesn't even qualify for any of the debates. He's buying his way in. And Democrats don't care, because all they care about is power. And he's giving away a lot of free stuff, Donna. And that is one of the reasons he is rising. I read this article. It wasn't in Bloomberg, I don't think. Are they allowed to say that?  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: I think it was NBC. There is free stuff at a Bloomberg event. He comes in, doesn't shake hands, doesn't take questions, speaks for 20 minutes and leaves. But they give you breakfast pastries, cheese boards, refreshments, and fully catered affairs. You have purity of massive spreads of barbecued pork, chicken, potato salad, and sweet tea, and free beer.  GUTFELD: I'm there.  WATTERS: I'm telling you. I'm giving this guy a second look --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: This guy knows what he's doing when it comes to handing out free stuff. But I think that all seriously --  BRAZILE: What state is that because --  WATTERS: This is in Nashville and Virginia. And even pro-gun guys came to the event. They're not voting for Mike but they came for the free beer. I'm telling you, Donna. The guy might have figured out something really smart. You know, say what you want about him. Paying for people's free food is a definitely good way. But in all seriousness, tomorrow night, he's -- we are going to see if he can take a punch.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: That's right. He's got to stay low. Biden is desperate. He's a wounded animal. And Bernie is the number one dude, so they're going to be coming for everybody.  BRAZILE: -- the person with the largest number of delegates is Mayor Pete.  (CROSSTALK)  BRAZILE: And let me just say it's going to be a great debate. And Michael Bloomberg will fit in, and I think he will be well prepared to take on his challengers. Now, coming up on THE FIVE, Democrats fear more campaign chaos, not me, ahead of the Nevada caucuses. I will be out there gambling all of Jesse's money.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WATTERS: Democrats are fearing more campaign chaos and division as the Nevada caucuses could turn into an Iowa repeat. Campaigns and volunteers are reportedly worried about an impending disaster in Nevada this weekend, President Trump, though, more than happy to throw gas on the fire.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: It just seems unfair what's happening to Bernie Sanders, to be honest with you. I watched it happen four years ago. And always be careful what you wish for. And I'm not wishing for anything. Whoever it is, I'll be very happy. But it seems that Bernie Sanders and that whole big section of the Democratic Party. It seems they are being taken advantage of like they were four years ago.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: And while the Democrats destroy themselves, it looks like Barack Obama is ready to come to the rescue. According to a new report, Obama, quote, ""expects to campaign often and loudly in the general election, even if he has to step in to try to unite liberals, moderates, and progressives beforehand."" I mean, that is interesting.  I mean, if you do have a broker convention or something crazy and the party's on each other's throats, you have Barack Obama has to come in, Greg, and save the day?  GUTFELD: Yeah. I mean, he's been called no-drama-Obama. I call him no- show-o. Because -- he stayed out because he doesn't want to hurt Joe's feelings, if Joe hadn't been in this race, he probably would've been more vocal. But it's like a talent show that your kid is at. Your kid sucks. Like, he knows his kid can't sing. So he should go to the talent show anyway and egg him on.  But no, Joe just said I'm out of here. I've got to work late. So Joe was kind of languishing on his own. He's got no support from the guy that he worked with eight years. And I don't think that's fair. Also, I think Nevada should just count by hand. I mean, they have the casinos. People count cards.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: Good at counting.  BRAZILE: This is American -- this is democracy. And democracy sometimes gets messy. Over the weekend, they had early votes. In fact, it ends today. Huge turnout, over 50 percent of the people who have already turned out are new caucus goers. We are looking at an extremely large turnout, because there's a lot of excitement within the Democratic Party.  I know it's hard to see the excitement when you're not really among the people who are out there in those long lines.  GUTFELD: I see panic.  BRAZILE: But --  (CROSSTALK)  BRAZILE: Here is the only concern that I have and people who were inside the middle. The apps, we know that didn't work in Iowa. So they have a Google spreadsheet. They're training people on the technology. And the technology is used to determine when you walk into the polling site. They're making sure that you are a registered voter and your name is on the list. So once you finish that experience, it should be a good experience.  WATTERS: Well, if Bernie, as the polls suggest, wins Nevada, I mean, he's got really the wind at his back going into South Carolina.  COMPAGNO: Right. And he will also have knives at his back from his same party. And that is the whole point that this is a party without a leader. It is without a unifying leader, and everything that we are seeing and talking about is a symptom of that chaos, right, the ridiculous chaos in Iowa, the potential for it to happen in Nevada.  Pelosi saying this insane rhetoric, ex-president stepping in. Like, you're telling me is in this entire population of the country and the entire party, there is not someone else that can unify? And this primary process isn't helping at all. So there -- that party is no closer to identifying who that leader, that person is, even before people started voting. And I think there will be a lot of people that disagree in that party that it should be Bernie Sanders.  BRAZILE: Have you taken a look at Barack Obama approval ratings lately compared to Trump? Barack Obama --  GUTFELD: He's not running.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: That always happens when a president leaves office.  BRAZILE: But he is a very popular president.  (CROSSTALK)  BRAZILE: No, we should not move on --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: -- when the current president, with pretty good ratings, gets out in front of the cameras and says, you know, Bernie is getting hosed. It's happening again. And it's really unfair. Do you think that makes a difference with Democrats?  PERINO: I don't know. I think the Bernie people live in a grieved state. And -- but all the rule changes that we're talking about like in Nevada, for example, where they're going to rank choice voting, and all the things that the DNC did to change were to accommodate Bernie Sanders.  WATTERS: What he wanted.  PERINO: Bernie Sanders got exactly what he wanted. So if he's also complaining about this, he's just a victim and a wimp. And I would add --  GUTFELD: What, Dana?  PERINO: President Obama is only going to come out once in the general election. He can be at the convention if he needs to be. He can be a kingmaker or a peacemaker. This is typical of presidents. He's not going to do it beforehand. But I will also say this, all of these campaigns who are saying Nevada is going to be a disaster, I think because they know Bernie Sanders is very good at the caucus organization.  WATTERS: Right.  PERINO: So he's likely to win in Nevada. So they're already pre-spinning away that it doesn't matter so that he doesn't get to take advantage of that momentum again, just like they denied him in Iowa from the technical difficulties and in New Hampshire because they basically said we're off to the races anyway. So I think that that might be the only way that Biden staggers to South Carolina.  WATTERS: OK. Staggering Joe, we'll be watching. President Trump issuing some big clemency decisions completing the sentence of Blago. Remember the governor from Illinois? That's up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PERINO: President Trump today granting clemency to some high profile figures including commuting the sentence of Rod Blagojevich, the former Illinois governor who was serving the eighth year of a 14-year prison sentence for trying to sell President Obama's Senate seat among other things. President Trump also pardoning former New York Police Commissioner Bernie Kerik who served three years in federal prison after he pleaded guilty to tax fraud and lying to the government. Here's the president earlier.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have commuted the sentence of Rod Blagojevich. He served eight years in jail. It's a long time to go. Many people disagree with the sentences. He's a Democrat. He's not a Republican. It was a prosecution by the same people Comey, Fitzpatrick, the same group.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: There was a tweet of course from Bernie Sanders. He said today, ""Trump granted clemency to tax cheats, Wall Street crooks, billionaires, and corrupt government officials. Meanwhile, thousands of poor and working- class kids sit in jail for nonviolent drug convictions. This is what a broken and racist criminal justice system looks like.""  So I'm sure this is going to be a topic tomorrow at the debate. Maybe what you could do from a legal point of view, Emily, is explain to people the difference between a commutation and a pardon.  COMPAGNO: A pardon expunged is that conviction altogether and a commutation just reduces the sentence, usually the time served. So basically, you're free to go, but you will still have that conviction. A pardon is you are no longer a convicted felon.  It's interesting, you know, Bernie Sanders though is having such an issue with that, because he's been a legislator for a long time. And he has had plenty of years to work on and be a leader for legislative reform in the criminal justice system. So the notion that President Trump waving a wand is so abhorrent to these people that have had all the power within them this entire time for someone who does spend a lot of time in prisons and with inmates and with convicted felons. I think that's all wrong.  BRAZILE: Well, during Barack Obama's tenure -- I had to bring President Obama back. Well, it's President's Week, so why not? He did initiate a lot of reforms in the criminal justice system to reduce sentences, especially for nonviolent offenders. And I'm proud of the work that he did in that area. Eric Holder was a leader, and Bernie Sanders did embrace that.  I wanted to say the President did release to non-violent individuals today, similar to Alice Johnson, so that's a good thing. But the problem with commuting or pardoning people like the former governor, we have too many corrupt elected officials in this country, too many people who are still stealing taxpayers money. You just have to Google it.  I started Googling it and it just came up from every region of the country. And I think to pardon individuals like the governor sends a bad -- a bad signal.  PERINO: Well, Jesse, the governor, Blagojevich, we're talking on the break, like that was a huge story at the time.  WATTERS: Right.  PERINO: Remember, I was like, wait, he did what he called it what? He called what? And then there was the attempted extortion of the Children's Hospital and other things for personal gain. Like that was at the time kind of the definition of the swamp.  WATTERS: Yes. He tried to sell a Senate seat and then got caught. I think he probably got his sentence commuted because he was on Celebrity Apprentice. Everybody knows probably it's a personal connection. But 14 years for trying to sell a Senate seat. It's a little much. I would have given him a little bit less but that's neither here nor there.  Bernie Kerik had renovations done to his apartment in exchange for a political favor and then lied about it. He's supposed to get two years according to the guidelines. He gets four. I mean, the guy is a patriot. He made a really bad judgment. It just seems like an overzealous sentence and prosecution. But if you look at when the left gets upset, I mean, there was that five-time illegal alien felon who murdered Kate Steinle, and he gets nothing. And the left was cheering. They were clapping. And now these guys get commutations or whatever after a lot of time served, and they're saying this is a grave miscarriage of justice? I mean, do these help Trump politically? Not really. Are they as bad as when Bill Clinton pardons the largest tax cheat in U.S. history --  BRAZILE: What about him? What about him?  WATTERS: Or the Puerto Rican terrorists, probably not.  BRAZILE: What about him?  PERINO: What do you think, Greg, is Blago's second act here, getting a second chance here, to come out and do what?  GUTFELD: Have you seen him? He looks great. He's fit. He's got this incredible, wavy white hair.  WATTERS: He's got that prison build, Greg?  GUTFELD: I think he's going to do the sexy grandfather calendar 2021. I don't know. You know, I think to your point, though, this doesn't fit the mission of draining the swamp. Blago was one of the worst kind of swamp rats. He was selling a seat. And we did that story here. This is before you were here, Jesse. So you're exempt. But I mean, we talked about --  PERINO: A lot.  GUTFELD: What a cook he was and how bad it was. And that's why it's like -- it's not something I agree with. It's not something I care too much about. I would prefer to see other people more deserving of commutation. There must be, but is it --  BRAZILE: The former San Francisco 49ers. You know, this guy --  GUTFELD: Wait, wait, I'm a 49er fan, so that's OK.  BRAZILE: No, no --  GUTFELD: That's OK.  BRAZILE: Because that involved my state of Louisiana and getting bribes. This sends a bad signal.  PERINO: There was one more -- the Michael -- the Michael Milken one, so he was involved in the junk bond trading stuff. Since then when he got out, he has done a lot of philanthropy --  GUTFELD: That's is true.  PERINO: Especially on prostate cancer. He is trying to like work his way up out of that hole.  WATTERS: There are worse things. And when you don't prosecute someone like McCabe who lies under oath four times to federal agents or you don't nail Hillary for obstruction after she acid-washes 30,000 e-mails under the subpoena. Those are the kind of things that people get really angry about.  PERINO: Also swampy.  WATTERS: Not Bernie Kerik who has already served this time.  BRAZILE: And you get angry -- and you get angry at a president that's trying to solicit, you know, dirt from a foreign country on an American citizen.  GUTFELD: You mean, almost president Hillary. You mean Hillary.  BRAZILE: So we all -- we all --  WATTERS: Acquitted. Acquitted.  PERINO: All right, we got to go.  BRAZILE: But forever impeached.  PERINO: All right, don't go anywhere.  WATTERS: Forever acquitted.  PERINO: The ""FASTEST SEVEN"" is up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  COMPAGNO: Welcome back. Time for the ""FASTEST SEVEN."" First up, this woman is not horsing around, you guys, shocking fellow passengers after she brought her mini service horse onto a plane for a first-class flight to California. Greg, what do you think is weird or the fact that she has a -- that, or that it's dressed in that sack, the turquoise sack?  GUTFELD: The worst thing about it was the horse reclined.  WATTERS: Yes.  GUTFELD: You know what, the rule is if you bring a horse on a flight, it has to go into the main cabin.  PERINO: That's OK. I heard that horse is going to be on Jesse's show this weekend.  COMPAGNO: Oh, really?  WATTERS: That's right, and the owner, exclusive.  GUTFELD: Trump supporters.  WATTERS: That's true. He wore a MAGA hat. They had to take it off because it's very offensive to coach.  COMPAGNO: Wait, are you serious?  WATTERS: No, I'm not serious, Emily. And the horse didn't recline either.  COMPAGNO: Donna, save me, please.  BRAZILE: No. First of all, I will immediately jump off the plane, not walk off, just jump off. If I saw a horse, I mean what's next, a snake?  WATTERS: Snakes on a plane.  GUTFELD: I have -- I have a therapist snake, Donna.  BRAZILE: No I'm not for that.  PERINO: Oh my God, Greg.  BRAZILE: I believe service dogs are OK. Greg, what are you doing over there?  PERINO: Nothing. Nothing.  GUTFELD: No, nothing.  BRAZILE: Service dogs are OK, but horses, I love horses, but not on the plane, you all.  COMPAGNO: I just didn't like that sack thing. It was like an --  GUTFELD: But every new phenomenon has corruption. Like when you have currency, you get counterfeits. Military Service has stolen valor. So whenever something new happens, there's always a grifter.  WATTERS: Are you doubting this woman?  GUTFELD: No, you can't doubt a victim, cannot doubt a victim.  BRAZILE: Anxiety -- look, I respect that.  COMPAGNO: Remember the peacock, the iguana? I mean, it was only a matter of time before we started having -- and there were pigs too. Whatever. Next up, I love this one. According to a new study, dog owners take more photos of their pet than they do have their spouse and family.  PERINO: Absolutely.  COMPAGNO: Obviously. And I think we have a lot of pictures of our pets, if I'm not mistaken, that we constantly put on social media too, right?  GUTFELD: No, we don't. I got rid them.  COMPAGNO: Oh, that's Jasper.  GUTFELD: Oh, wait a second.  PERINO: Look at that guy. That's Jasper.  GUTFELD: You know, this is surprising that this would happen.  WATTERS: Rookie.  COMPAGNO: That's Jesse's little pup.  GUTFELD: What's that? What do you think -- what do you think is behind this?  COMPAGNO: There's my girl.  BRAZILE: And I want to see --  COMPAGNO: The cutest.  BRAZILE: That's my (INAUDIBLE) but I also have Pixie.  WATTERS: Wait, where's Greg's pet?  COMPAGNO: So what do you guys think about this?  WATTERS: I have a lot more pictures of Emma on my phone than Rookie, tons more. I think this is a fake study.  COMPAGNO: But she probably has more pictures of Rookie than of you.  WATTERS: She better not.  COMPAGNO: A guarantee.  PERINO: I mean, just because like -- everyone always asked me, why don't you post pictures of Peter. I'm like, because Peter is taking all the pictures.  WATTERS: Right. He's the photographer.  PERINO: So like yes. So usually like one person in the relationship is usually the person taking the photographer, the other person.  GUTFELD: I just don't like to objectify my pets.  PERINO: Yes.  GUTFELD: You know, when I have them out there and I'm taking shots and you got to loosen them up.  WATTERS: You mean your snake, Greg?  GUTFELD: Yes, my snake. I just don't think it's right. And I think objectifying a reptile is the worst thing you can do. That's why I keep my snake private.  PERINO: Thank you.  BRAZILE: Thank you.  COMPAGNO: Finally, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is being called a hypocrite after pledging to spend $10 billion to fight climate change. Amazon customers calling him out, ""Could he please start with his ridiculous packaging and that he leaves on our doorstep? Perhaps the Amazon delivery could collect the significant waste left behind. #fameseeking. What do we think about this, you guys?  GUTFELD: Hey, can I just say what kind of sick humor Jeff Bezos has that he named his company when it started Amazon and he was selling millions of books. That's like McDonald's, you know changing their name to cattle slaughter.  WATTERS: It's a good point, Greg. You're very witty today. It started with the clever monologue and we're still at it at the ""FASTEST.""  PERINO: The recurring snake. Peter gets -- it drives him crazy how much extra packaging is in all of the Amazon stuff because you have to put it away, and I get that. But how many people also complain all the time that anything that comes from Amazon, if it's broken, they complain. So people have to make a choice. And I also think that this donation that he's making also helps him with some better media coverage.  GUTFELD: It's virtue signaling.  PERINO: Like please -- wait, you can't be mean to him for anything else because he is doing $10 billion.  GUTFELD: Yes. He bought up -- he bought up the green movement.  PERINO: And I was like how -- do you know how much $10 billion is for him? That's like us kicking in $100.  GUTFELD: Exactly.  WATTERS: Well, it's like you kicking $100.  BRAZILE: I'm glad -- I'm glad he's doing it. I think it's a wonderful idea to save our planet.  WATTERS: Oh, stop. $10 million for the weather?  GUTFELD: Billion.  WATTERS: Billion for the weather, billion. There's kids dying of cancer. There's a coronavirus.  PERINO: Well, maybe --  WATTERS: Kids who can't read.  PERINO: (INAUDIBLE) a nuclear fusion.  WATTERS: Yes. I mean, have you seen what these Washington Post reporters look like? They need to raise, Donna.  BRAZILE: You know what? You know what? He is setting an example for others to follow his --  GUTFELD: Other billionaires?  BRAZILE: No. Others to follow on his footsteps.  GUTFELD: No, you're right though. Bernie Sanders, if Bernie Sanders is president, he wouldn't have that money. He wouldn't be able to do that.  BRAZILE: Look, it doesn't matter if it's $1 million or $100, we need to do everything to save our planet.  PERINO: We also wouldn't have gas.  GUTFELD: We wouldn't have gas, either. I would still have gas.  BRAZILE: We need to do everything to save our planet.  PERINO: He should just put all of that money towards the nuclear fusion research that is really the only promising thing that could power our economy and also decrease climate change. That's the only thing.  GUTFELD: She's right.  COMPAGNO: And on that perfect note, ""ONE MORE THING"" is up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: Time now for ""ONE MORE THING."" Jesse.  WATTERS: Everyone's been waiting for Jesse's jujitsu news.  GUTFELD: Oh my goodness.  WATTERS: That's right.  BRAZILE: You can move?  WATTERS: That's right. I train every week with my instructor Pedro who's an absolute monster. There he is right there. Now, look at the belt that I'm wearing. That's his. He took the gold and the featherweight expert division at the North American Grappling Association Championship in Boston this weekend.  And it's not as first medal. Look at this guy. He came to the country from Brazil three years ago. He's cleaned up. He wins everything. Look at the hardware, everybody. Total beast.  GUTFELD: So you're saying he's taking belts from other people?  WATTERS: Yes, Greg. He's beating up the people Americans won't beat up.  PERINO: I never -- I never heard of the grappling associate.  WATTERS: Yes, yes, yes, grappling.  BRAZILE: He comes from a country name after my family, Jesse.  WATTERS: Donna Brazile. There it is.  BRAZILE: I may give you some Jiu-Jitsu.  GUTFELD: Just no grappling.  WATTERS: I'll defend the takedown.  GUTFELD: All right, Dana. I believe your next.  PERINO: All right. I want to say congratulations to Illinois Congressman Adam Kinzinger and his new wife, Sofia. They got married on Saturday at an 18th-century monastery in Antigua, Guatemala. His hometown --  GUTFELD: Destination wedding.  PERINO: You know what, this one -- this one looks pretty good. The congressman's -- the congressman's hometown pastor even went down for it and he had some photos. He said, I am one very lucky man to have this incredible woman as my wife. Here's to forever and congratulations to Mr. And Mrs. Kinzinger.  GUTFELD: So he probably heard about Jesse's destination wedding and he says Guatemala.  WATTERS: Yes, it wasn't the D.R.  BRAZILE: Congratulations.  WATTERS: You dodged a bullet there.  GUTFELD: You need a Dr. At the D.R.  PERINO: I mean, could we have drank it from the minibar?  GUTFELD: All right, I'm going to shut up. You know what I'm going to do? I haven't done this in a while.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: I hate these people.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Yes. All right, so great news, great news. Faith No More announced their 2020 tour across North America, but they're partnering with Korn.  COMPAGNO: Oh, yes, I heard that.  GUTFELD: Yes, you heard that too.  COMPAGNO: Yes.  GUTFELD: I got nothing against Korn, but it's just not my scene. It's not my style. I'm a Faith No More person. I'm not a Korn person. It's like putting -- it's like putting peanut butter and gravel together.  PERINO: What is Korn?  GUTFELD: Korn is a metal band. I'm sure they're very talented, very successful, but it's like ice cream and liver. It's like steak and spiders. I mean, Faith No More, one of the greatest bands. You got Mike Patton and then you're going to put them with Korn.  WATTERS: What are you going to do?  GUTFELD: I don't know because it depends on who performs first.  COMPAGNO: Well, it's like --  WATTERS: Korn is going to open up for Faith No More or the other way around?  GUTFELD: I think Korn is more commercially viable so it might be that Faith No More comes before Korn or -- which is great.  COMPAGNO: Wait, that's good.  PERINO: Because then you can leave.  GUTFELD: Yes. But then again, I don't want to bash Korn even though I'm against the backward R in their name because they stole that from Toys R Us.  PERINO: Maybe they can unify like the -- like Bloomberg wants to do.  GUTFELD: That's not -- that's not how it works with the music.  BRAZILE: Well, I'm looking forward with Jill Scott. She's on a 20th anniversary.  GUTFELD: At least -- at least it's not the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Because if it was the Red Hot Chili Peppers, I would write Faith No More up for good. All right, Donna, it's you.  BRAZILE: It's personal.  GUTFELD: It is very personal, Donna.  BRAZILE: Well, I want to get personal. As you all know, yesterday was the National Random Act of Kindness Day.  PERINO: Yes. Greg was all over that.  GUTFELD: I actually did. How dare you? I randomly act kindness for a lot of people.  BRAZILE: A cab driver out in California picked up a 92-year-old woman, and she explained to him that she was going to the bank to withdraw $25,000 because she owed IRS. And he said, wait a minute, honey, you don't need to do it that way. Well, he got on the phone to talk to this scammer and found out that this man was trying to --  PERINO: Wow.  GUTFELD: That was the guy who called me.  BRAZILE: Yes.  GUTFELD: I had her. I almost had her.  COMPAGNO: Oh, God.  BRAZILE: Anyway, he took the woman -- thank you. He took her to the police office. They got to the, of course, the bottom of it all. She still -- she has her money.  WATTERS: What an idiot.  BRAZILE: But I just want to say to this cab driver, thank you. Because one day I will be 92 and if you pick me up, please do not take me to the bank to take my money.  PERINO: Oh, wow. That's a nice story.  WATTERS: You need a ride, Donna?  BRAZILE: From you, I'll walk.  WATTERS: All right.  GUTFELD: Emily, it's -- you're up.  COMPAGNO: OK, I have a really cute story out of Atlanta. So this eight- year-old, her favorite place to shop and go to is Target, just like my niece. And so she decided to have her birthday party there. And Target was so awesome. They gave her --  WATTERS: You can do that?  COMPAGNO: Yes -- her and all of her friends uniforms. They scan stuff. They had a scavenger hunt. They had a Target themed cake, super.  GUTFELD: What? Was Target open while they were doing this, because I would be against that?  WATTERS: You can shut down Target for a party?  COMPAGNO: I don't know the answer to that.  GUTFELD: You know, this is -- ""ONE MORE THING,"" Emily, you have to do your research. Because this is -- this is embarrassing for you and for all of us.  COMPAGNO: All you need to know is how adorable this is.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: Caroline is going to have her birthday there.  GUTFELD: No, that's actually fun. What's store would you do?  COMPAGNO: I don't know. The possibilities, they're endless now.  GUTFELD: Jiffy Lube.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: I'd go to Ted Baker.  GUTFELD: Ted Baker.  BRAZILE: (INAUDIBLE) in Nashville.  WATTERS: Oh, wow. I'd celebrate there.  COMPAGNO: What about you guys?  GUTFELD: I'd be at a medical supply company or perhaps a pharmacy. Pharmacy would be good.  PERINO: Afterhours.  GUTFELD: Afterhours.  WATTERS: I'm thinking of snake farm.  COMPAGNO: Oh my God.  GUTFELD: All right. Never miss an episode of THE FIVE. ""SPECIAL REPORT"", up next.  Hello, Bret.

76,FOX,"While we praise the media's self-reflection, remember they just spent three years calling you a sucker for supporting the president. Some are calling it a first-ever for CNN. No, it's not a ratings win. In front of an audience you can count on just your fingers and toes, one anchor provided a moment of self-reflection! TUCKER CARLSON, MARK STEYN SLAM 'CREEPY PORN LAWYER' AVENATTI AS 'SLEAZY CHANCER' AFTER CONVICTION ""I thought [Michael] Avenatti could be a serious candidate for president,"" CNN host Brian Stelter said. ""Was that stupid on my part?"" Well, now that Avenatti has been found guilty of extortion and is about to go on trial for other crimes, in addition to fueling the most heinous smears of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, I think the answer is, ""Yes, you were stupid."" That's putting it lightly, because this mea culpa should have happened before all the montages of hacks kissing Avenatti's butt forced your hand. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER What if he hadn't been found guilty? If he had walked, it would've been right into CNN's open arms. But, I should stop. I'm being a jerk. (See, I can self-reflect too!) True to the maxim that you should never mock someone for doing the right thing, I say, ""Good job, Brian,"" and you too, Jeffrey Toobin. ""The total collapse of his life is really sort of extraordinary,"" Toobin said. ""Frankly, I feel kind of snookered, because I took him seriously."" ""Snookered"" means you were unfairly tricked, that you are the victim. Jeff, why were you fooled when everyone beyond the media wasn't? Was it because you wanted to believe Avenatti had the goods on Trump and Kavanaugh, no matter how absurd those goods were? The media's excuse was that Avenatti was part of the Stormy Daniels story. They were looking for a savior, not a stripper. After all, where is her spotlight now? So, the media got snookered, because like a remote tribe thinking an empty Coca-Cola bottle falling from the sky came from the gods, their desperation made them credulous. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP So, hurray for self-reflection, but remember: These suckers just spent three years calling you ""suckers"" for supporting the president.

77,FOX,"Former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg's past comments, policies spark outrage; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" February 17, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino along with Emily Compagno, Donna Brazile, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It is 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is ""The Five."" Another jam-packed week of 2020 politics as President Trump threatens to overshadow Democrats yet again. The president is up for a big Las Vegas rally the day before the Nevada caucuses, which are on Saturday. And instead of putting their full focus on Trump, 2020 Democrats, they're going after each other, this time setting their sights on Michael Bloomberg and his campaign spending. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AMY KLOBUCHAR (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He just can't hide behind the airways. He has to answer questions. JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Sixty billion dollars can buy you a lot of advertising. But it can't erase your record. There's a lot to talk about Michael Bloomberg. ELIZABETH WARREN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: -- democracy. No one should be able to buy an election. BERNIE SANDERS (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, I got news for Mr. Bloomberg. And that is the American people are sick and tired of billionaires buying elections. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: And Bloomberg's past comments continue to cause problems. Rivals say Bloomberg is insulting hardworking farmers, saying resurface video (ph). But his campaign responding by saying Bloomberg's comments are being taken out of context. And he was contrasting thousands of years of farming with today's technology-driven workplace. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL BLOOMBERG (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If you think about the agrarian society, it lasted 3,000 years. And we can teach processes. I can teach anybody, even people in this room, so no offense intended to be a farmer. It's a process. You dig a hole. You put a seed in. You put dirt on top. Add water, up comes the corn. Then, you have 300 years of the industrial society. You put the piece of metal on the leaf (ph) you turn the crank in the direction of the arrow and you can have job (ph). (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: Bloomberg also making news today after his campaign pushed back on a report that he would consider Hillary Clinton as his vice presidential pick. I think that was not true. Jesse, do you think that that was true? JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST: No. PERINO: Do you think Hillary Clinton's people put that out there? WATTERS: He needs a food tester. I don't know if I would trust Hillary as my VP. She'd be right after every move he made. I think that was just a leak to drudge to get some media out of the weekend. But she's got so much baggage. He needs someone young and energetic and crooked doesn't come to mind when you think about that. PERINO: And also they can't be both from New York. WATTERS: I did not know that. PERINO: There you go. WATTERS: That's interesting. I learned a lot of interesting things about Mike Bloomberg this weekend. You know, he's been nasty to women and to blacks and to seniors and to farmers. But I did not know that he puts ice in his beer, which is pure psychopath. (CROSSTALK) PERINO: -- if you are a billionaire -- (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: I guess you can, but -- (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: And the question is -- bottom line, do any of these Democrats out there, are they talented enough to capitalize on all these ridiculous things coming out of the Bloomberg campaign? My answer is no. They're just -- this is not strong enough and they are all too weak. The guy has got no message. What is his message? I'm richer and nicer than Donald Trump? PERINO: He says Mike can get it done. WATTERS: Yeah. Mike can get it done. What is it? What is the it that Mike can get done? Mike's not even running his campaign. He's not -- he's just cutting checks. He's not even dictating the tweets. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: And everyone is getting rich off of the campaign. PERINO: But his numbers are going up, Donna. DONNA BRAZILE, GUEST CO-HOST: Don't worry about Michael Bloomberg. First of all -- (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: Do I look worried, Donna? BRAZILE: Yes, baby, I can see you. WATTERS: This is not the face of worry. BRAZILE: Baby, you are sweating because when you first start describing this man, I thought you were talking about Donald Trump. Because by the way, Michael Bloomberg is a former Republican, I first came to know him when he spoke the 2004 Republican convention here in New York. (CROSSTALK) BRAZILE: That is correct. You know what? And now, he's running. Now, let me just -- Dana asked a good question. His so-called slogan is Mike will bring decency, respect, and something else back to the White House. WATTERS: Something else. OK, it doesn't matter. BRAZILE: It gets blurry. All right, so here's the thing. Michael Bloomberg is running a two-track campaign. The first track is to get people like us to talk about him. WATTERS: Right. BRAZILE: Right? And the second track is to get people like us to vote for him. Now, on the first track, we are succeeding. We are talking about it. The second track, I don't think he's going to do that. WATTERS: I agree. BRAZILE: OK. Now, that's it. Can we talk about something else? (CROSSTALK) PERINO: Michael Bloomberg has a long career, as a lot of these -- especially if you are in your 70s and you're running. You have a long career. You've done a lot of things. You've probably gone to a lot of events. And I imagine that they are going to drop these little videos about Michael Bloomberg. (CROSSTALK) GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Tasteful erotic photography in his past. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: I was going to defend him until you told me about the ice cubes. Now, I don't know what to do. Look, this whole thing of this outrage, if the outrage is too easy, it's out of context, which means almost all outrage about comments and quotes are always out of context. And I defended it with people I like. And I will defend it with Bloomberg, who I'm kind of indifferent towards. But I would say that if, like, if you examine the statement that he made, it's in an audience that understands the statement. And when you take it under context, it means something else. So I'm going to take a statement that he made that now everybody is saying is really bad. So in 2011, he said that there is an enormous cohort of young black and Latino men who don't know how to behave in the workplace. All right, that's sounds terrible. Everybody is talking about it. But then the context is he was speaking to PBS, while introducing $127 million program to help minority guides get jobs. So what he was saying was how do you -- why is that program necessary, because there's an issue. And so he explains why there is an issue and he's trying to remedy the issue. So it's not fair to anybody when you -- right, left, middle, to keep to keep pulling these things out. The problem with the Democrats is -- or the left, actually, not -- they can't pass their own standards anymore, because you have a pocket of intersectional activists who think everybody is oppressed or -- and you are the oppressor. So they are applying today's -- I said this on Friday, they're applying today's standards to decisions that one makes in the past. And you can't do that. BRAZILE: And the other thing, Greg, to your point, because I agree with you half the time, as you well know, to your point, back in the day, stop and frisk, before it was ruled unconstitutional, was a practice not just here in New York but other lower cities. So let's just get that straight. GUTFELD: True. (CROSSTALK) BRAZILE: And Donald Trump made a speech before the police chiefs in 2018, where he said it was a good policy. It was a bad policy. You know why? Because you stop people who were in innocent just because of their skin color. By the way, I can't get rid of this. I may get rid of this, OK? Just because of your skin color, you are pulling people aside. And you're -- and that was ruled unconstitutional. GUTFELD: Can I respond to this? Because there are two points, it was originally called stop, question, and frisk. That's the first mistake because you're questioned, the cop makes an observation. But no one ever mentions the question part. Number two, before stop and frisk, people would complain, activists and politicians and media would complain, that people only care about crimes if it happens to a white person. Hence, the missing white girl gets attention but the black boys in Atlanta didn't, the young black boys that -- so that was a big criticism. So New York City decides we are going to focus on minority neighborhoods and get the crime out of there. That's racist, too. So if you focus, you are racist. And if you don't care, you are racist. So you can't win. (CROSSTALK) BRAZILE: During the peak of the crime epidemic in this country, many innocent people were pulled over, questioned, stopped, simply because of the way they look. And that's why it's good to talk about the policy and just not make it about the personality. PERINO: So let's get Emily in here about maybe on -- whatever you want to talk about. But I was thinking about then the Bloomberg's side of things. It is like -- Donna's point of we are all talking about him, but really the Democrats are all talking about him, because you are trying to buy this election. EMILY COMPAGNO, CO-HOST: Right. And it remains to be seen how many people don't care about that, because they say the only thing that matters is beating Donald Trump at the ballot box. I think what it's interesting about the -- all of the years that we are looking back on Bloomberg, is that yes, when you isolate the comments. You can either defend them or somehow explain them away, which a lot of people on his behalf are doing. But I think when you stand back and look at the trend. It belies that demeaning attitude or simply the selfish attitude that up until now, the entire Democratic Party was saying that they were trying to get away from. They didn't want another New York, self-centered, narcissistic, you know, fly over country hating person. And that's exactly what this person is representing himself to be in all of those video clips and the book about him and everything. It's not just one comment where you're, like, OK, is that enough. There is a ton that sort of belie that type of I'm better than you personality, infirming and everything. And I think it's interesting what Klobuchar said, which is look, you are beating us in the ads, sure. But you are not going to beat us on the stage. And I think it's really going to be fascinating to finally see him on the stage and see whether, for example, his now explanation of the stop and frisk, his first class seat on the -- (CROSSTALK) PERINO: -- it will be a big pile-on. Donna, is he in the debate? Is that announced yet? BRAZILE: I don't know. I think they are waiting on one more poll. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: They're waiting for a box. WATTERS: Yeah. Where's the box? BRAZILE: No. Stop that, you guys. That is not fair. GUTFELD: Why? (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: -- I can make short jokes. (CROSSTALK) PERINO: All right, coming up, the media turn Michael Avenatti into a big cable news star. But now after his conviction, will there be any self reflection? Greg's monologue on that next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GUTFELD: Some are calling it a first ever for CNN, no, not a ratings win. Dream on. In front of an audience, you can count on your fingers and toes one anchor gave this moment of self reflection. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I thought Avenatti could be a serious candidate for president. So give me a media critique. Was that stupid on my part? What do you make of how Avenatti was covered by CNN and MSNBC? (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Well, if you have to ask, now that Mikey's been found guilty of extortion about to go on trial for other crimes and fuel the most heinous smears of Brett Kavanaugh, I think the answer is yes. You were stupid. And that's putting it lightly. Because this mea culpa should have happened a while ago before all the montages, of hacks kissing Avenatti's butt had forced your hand. And what if he hadn't been found guilty? If he had walked, it would have been right into CNN's open arms. But I should stop. I'm being a jerk. See, I could self-reflect, too. True to the max (ph) and that you should never mock someone for doing the right thing. I say good job, Brian, and you too, Toobin. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The total collapse of his life is really sort of extra -- and frankly, you know, I feel kind of snookered, because I took him seriously. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Snookered means you were unfairly tricked, that you were the victim. But Jeff, why were you fooled when everyone beyond the media wasn't? Was it because you wanted to believe Mikey had the goods on Trump and Kavanaugh? No matter how absurd those goods were, the media's excuse was that Avenatti was a part of the Stormy story. No, they were looking for a savior, not a stripper. After all, where is their spotlight now? So the media got snookered because like a remote tribe thinking an empty Coke bottle falling from the sky came from the gods, their desperation made them credulous. So hooray for self reflection, but remember these suckers just spent three years calling you suckers for supporting the president. So see this as a rare moment. They will be back on that horse in no time, leaving a trail of manure wherever they go, which makes it an easy story to follow. All right, Donna, you agree with me on everything I just said, don't you? BRAZILE: I'm -- (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: But why is it so hard for the media to self reflect? BRAZILE: Look, the media should. We all should. That's what institutions should do. Look, Michael Avenatti came to the DNC meeting back in 2019. He came for my vote and the votes of other Democrats. And many of us looked him up, looked him down. He always wore nice suits just like you, Jesse. WATTERS: Not that night. (CROSSTALK) BRAZILE: This ain't no off direct quality. I just touched and I'm still bleeding. What Michael Avenatti was a scam artist. GUTFELD: Yeah. BRAZILE: Put it that way, OK. I hope he gets a fair trial in California. But this guy got over $175 million worth of free media. GUTFELD: Yup. BRAZILE: Defending Stormy Daniels, going out there with some other person. GUTFELD: Well, I -- speaking of free media, you just helped -- I want to play some free media. And you guys all comment on it. This is more of the obsession with Avenatti. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think that Mueller is not going to take Trump down. I think that Avenatti is going to take Trumped down. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because Donald Trump is terrified of Michael Avenatti. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: -- to me, you're like the Holy Spirit. You're like all praises at all times. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Michael Avenatti for president in 2020? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He is Donald Trump's worst nightmare, Michael Avenatti. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: So I don't know who to call on for this one, the Holy Spirit, anybody? PERINO: I'll take it. I think it's always important. I always like to question the -- if there is a lot of hype about something, like if it's a movie or a novel, I always want to wait just a minute. Like, tap the breaks. Let other people kick the tires before I would, like, jump in, because something like this could happen. And he did have scam artist -- (CROSSTALK) PERINO: -- in a nice suit. GUTFELD: Yeah. Emily, you're a lawyer. This guy makes your profession look disgusting. I look at you differently. BRAZILE: Thank you. COMPAGNO: What? (CROSSTALK) COMPAGNO: I think what is so -- I have so many troubling aspects about this, one of them being, you know, the total collapse of his life, how it's extraordinary. The total collapse doesn't happen overnight. That's like when you hear about a celebrity or a star, and they're like no, that was 10 years of them sleeping in their car and going on auditions 24 hours a day. So you don't get to a 36-count federal indictment without years of preparation on the federal government's part. He hasn't paid taxes since 2010. So the notion -- and this doesn't include, by the way -- (CROSSTALK) PERINO: The multiple lawsuits -- WATTERS: How do you do that? (CROSSTALK) COMPAGNO: And, you know, there multiple lawsuits by his clients as well. So all of that is not only discoverable but it's obvious. So that's number one. So the fact is that this is like oh, we had no idea, all it does is speak volumes about them, not him. (CROSSTALK) BRAZILE: He should've been vetted. And just likewise, we need to vet cabinet members. We need to vet people in general. That's why we're vetting Michael Bloomberg, OK? I mean, we have to vet -- GUTFELD: We know Bloomberg. We knew Trump. We didn't know this guy, which leads me to my big question is he -- do these guys have any excuse for saying we were snookered? WATTERS: Permission to make an analogy. GUTFELD: Absolutely, granted. WATTERS: The media's like the guy at a bar that falls in love with a prostitute, right? Everybody at the bar knows that she's a prostitute. And they are all laughing and they're all warning the guy. But the guy thinks he's in love. And the other thing they have a connection. And no one really believes there's a connection there. And he goes upstairs, she takes his money. He has a good time. But you know what? He learns nothing from it. And he does it again the next month. And this is what happens in the media. It's not just Avenatti. It's the dossier. It's Smollett. It's Covington. I mean, they fell for Beto. They think global warming is going to kill us in 12 years. These people are all marks. And they get taken advantage of by the CIA, by leakers, by politicians, by lobbyists. If they had the same agenda as you, they would just buy the media up and then they are gone the next day. BRAZILE: Waiting in the waters. PERINO: I might have held your hand on that one. WATTERS: No. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: The media is being used and they kind of like it. (CROSSTALK) BRAZILE: People get pimped all the time. You talk about prostitutes. This was a pimp. WATTERS: Well, who is running Michael? GUTFELD: Interesting. You know what? We have more of this scintillating conversation. Coming up next, former journalist throw their support behind Bloomberg, but will it backfire? That's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BRAZILE: Retired ABC news anchor, Sam Donaldson, yes, he's my friend, is jumping to politics and he is endorsing Mike Bloomberg. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think Mike Bloomberg is best suited to take on Donald J. Trump this November and beat him. And that's something I think is very important for the country. We are in the grip, Anderson, of a sick, ignorant man. He is mean. He is corrupt. And if we don't get this right, we may lose the things that have made this country the best place to live in the world. (END VIDEO CLIP) BRAZILE: Wait a minute. There is more. Former CBS anchor, Katie Couric, said this, and she is also my friend. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let me ask everybody about this race and Michael Bloomberg. First of all, he was insulting Trump the other day. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, my god. It was so amazing, wasn't it? Trump is like a heat-seeking missile. He can latch to your vulnerabilities. And Bloomberg, I think in that one tweet, Donald Trump hates that his back was turned. You know that all the New York maccas (ph) turned their back on him. (END VIDEO CLIP) BRAZILE: Oh, my god. All my friends are just jumping on board the Bloomberg train. You know, I better just go ahead and get myself a helicopter and fly right over there. Now, you know, we all know that celebrity and media endorsements, they always occur. But this is a journalist. So Dana, I mean, what do you think? PERINO: I don't know. I mean, if you're not under 45, you might not remember Sam Donaldson. But if you were to take yourself back you know -- in my house, we watched all the news. We watched all the programs, all the Sunday shows like my dad and I would watch it. Debate it, loved it. And Sam Donaldson was one of those guys from back then. Katie Couric, I think -- I'm going to set that aside, because I do think that it's a little bit different. But Sam Donaldson was one of those people that when, like, the George H.W. Bush campaign, I'm going back to the President George H.W. 41, the first one. When they would complain about media bias, it was people like Sam Donaldson that would say how dare you accuse us of media bias. When Newsweek ran that -- the whimp cover about George H.W. Bush at the time and they complained about media bias, he's like, how dare you. We are journalists. We are fair and balanced. And I don't think that Sam Donaldson did the media any favors if they are worried about their credibility. BRAZILE: I don't think it matters. (CROSSTALK) PERINO: I'm indignant anyway. BRAZILE: They're nice on paper. And by the way, I just want to -- for the record, there are so many endorsements out there. Joe Biden, of course, George Martin, the creator of Games of Thrones, he endorsed Joe Biden. Michael Bloomberg, Judge Judy also -- (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: Love her. (CROSSTALK) PERINO: But Sam Donaldson is different. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: Here's the deal. I'm not friends with either of them, so I don't care. Katie's problem is she was trying to be too current and too cool. And she did -- she fell for the same old mind-reading trick like she knows what Trump is thinking. No, she is completely gone. She doesn't know what she's talking about. The joke about Sam is that he said this is the first time in his career that he's made a political choice. How blind does he have to be not see his own bias or that flying squirrel that is sleeping on his head for the last 30 years? (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: No, that ain't real. If that is real, he needs to shave it off and replace it with something else. But these are parallel blind spots, you see? If you can't see what's crazy on top of your head, you can't see what's crazy inside your head. (CROSSTALK) BRAZILE: First of all, I've known him for a long time. I will defend Sam Donaldson any day of the week. He's a wonderful person. GUTFELD: I will trash him every day. BRAZILE: You're trashing him for what reason? GUTFELD: Just because I don't like -- I don't like schmoozey -- hey, I know this guy. I don't care. Screw him. (CROSSTALK) BRAZILE: Did you read his statement? I thought it was a very clear, concise statement. GUTFELD: I can't hear him with that shiny thing on his head. WATTERS: Listen. He's a newscaster. He's endorsing a guy that ordered his own news organization not to report on him, and that to report on any of the other Democrats. I mean, that's total hypocrisy. And think about it. We are now having the media endorse a billionaire who says mean things about women and says we need to throw blacks up against the wall and it's not Donald Trump. Seriously, it that where we are right now? This guy endorsed Scott Brown over Liz Warren. He endorsed George W. Bush over John Kerry. He has outspent Sanders, who spent the most by $400 million, $400 million, Donna. And the media's been saying we need to get money out of politics. There is this huge gap between the rich and the poor when you campaign finance. You can't buy elections. And the first billionaire that comes along and starts throwing money at Democrats and saying mean things about Trump, everybody starts gushing. Come on. You know how hypocritical this is. BRAZILE: Now, Michael Bloomberg knows Donald Trump in ways that many of us don't know Donald Trump. But look, let's go back to this celebrity endorsement. Emily, come on. You can't imagine John Legend endorsed Elizabeth Warren. COMPAGNO: And that's helped. I'm kidding. I mean, it hasn't helped. It doesn't matter. WATTERS: She went right down. BRAZILE: No. But that's my whole point. I mean, endorsements really don't matter. But I'm glad Sam has an opinion. He's a retired journalist and he's free to do what he wants to do. WATTERS: He should be retired. BRAZILE: Well, at 86, I hope we're retired too, babe. GUTFELD: That hair is only 20. BRAZILE: Not you. Not you. That hair is good, by the way. Like your hair. Go ahead, Emily. I'm sorry. COMPAGNO: No, it's OK. Yes, I think that those endorsements only work in the micro sense that if John Legend were to host a celebrities-only dinner with access to E. Warren in Hollywood at 25 grand a plate, sure, go ahead. And otherwise, all it is, is exhausting and disappointing. It's like earlier today, when I was looking at this new favorite author of mine, I'm like, oh, yes, I want to see if she's on social media and follow her. And then the first thing I saw was a very disappointing political tweet to me -- to in my opinion, and I was like damn. Like not you too. PERINO: Right. And so -- BRAZILE: What did you do? COMPAGNO: Yes, what -- and then this -- what else I want to say is that similar to what we talked about a moment ago, that all this does is speak volumes about those journalists and not the candidate that they're trying to endorse. So with Sam Donaldson saying, he understands people. Really? Like that's the phrase you're going to use after 30 years of being quiet about it? That's what you think is actually going to make me be like, oh, he does, I'm going to vote for him. All it does is belied his idiocy in that moment. BRAZILE: He's retired. COMPAGNO: And also the fact that there's a huge disconnect between those media figures and actual real people. GUTFELD: Right. COMPAGNO: And with Katie Couric sitting there and being like, he's like a missile, and amazing, New York is not the center of the universe and there's a whole other country that feels disconnected by both who's running on the left, and also the media that is covering it. BRAZILE: And let's just say this. Dave Chappelle was -- endorsed John -- I mean, Mr. Yang. Mr. Yang is out. Dave Chappelle, I'm sure Mr. Bloomberg is looking for you. Now. Zoom, zoom, President Trump has got a warm welcome at the Daytona 500. See it next on THE FIVE. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Daytona International Speedway, we love our country, and it's truly an honor to be with all of you at the great American race. Gentlemen, start your engines. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Thunderous applause and cheers for President Trump at the Daytona 500. The President and the First Lady arriving in style, flying over the racetrack on Air Force One before getting that rock star welcome. Trump also jumped into his limo they called The Beast to lead the warm-up lap. Of course, some in the liberal media hated it. Here's more from the president. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: The tens of thousands of patriots here today have come for the fastest cars in the world-class motorsports. But NASCAR fans never forget that no matter who wins the race, what matters most is God, family, and country. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: That's right. All right, Emily, did you watch? COMPAGNO: Yes, of course. WATTERS: Yes. COMPAGNO: OK. I love everything about this. I was so excited about this topic. When I cheered for the Raiders, there were so many people who when we would go out and do philanthropic things and community activities, that my -- their interaction with me was the one second that they might ever have in their whole lifetime, like touching essentially, the organization. And it was so important for me to be that appropriate ambassador and represent that organization because it was all larger than me. And that's how I felt about this. How incredible for the president to be at the Daytona 500, and to meet people and to be among people who don't live in D.C., who don't have that sort of everyday access that a lot of journalists do, who scoffed at this. And we saw a tweet by Maggie Haberman, right, and she was saying, using the official apparatus of the government for what appears to be a political event. No, you know what that was? The Beast is 22,000 pounds of badassery. And having our American president leading the NASCAR race, the biggest race of the season and meeting all of those --- we had Brian -- Clint Bowyer who was saying, you know, I judge people on how they treat me and others I'm with. And the President in that moment, shook my hand. He was nice to everyone. He took selfies with us. He did everything we wanted him to do. He was a regular guy who was excited about being there. So yesterday, I was 100 percent proud of my president, proud to love NASCAR, and I loved everything about it. WATTERS: Donna, you don't think that was abusive what the President did right? BRAZILE: Well, to use White House official funds. I mean, that's an issue that everyone -- whenever you use funds, that's -- GUTFELD: Can he take an Uber? BRAZILE: Hold on a second. Maybe Lyft. I would have -- I would have given him a Lyft. I don't -- I don't major in the minors, and so -- I and I love sports. George W. Bush went, Ronald Reagan went. So let's have fun, folks. I'm not -- I'm not into that. WATTERS: OK. Good, good. I'm surprised to hear that. BRAZILE: He went to the LSU Alabama games. WATTERS: Yes. He's been at baseball games, all presidents do sporting event. BRAZILE: Hold on. He went to LSU, Alabama, LSU won. He went to -- he went to the final game with Clemson, LSU won. As far as I'm concerned, every time he shows my team win. WATTERS: OK. Except last time in 2016. What do you think, Dana? PERINO: Well, just from a communication standpoint in the White House, like it was masterfully done. And it was fun. WATTERS: Except the rain delay. PERINO: Yes. Nothing you can do about that. But you know, that actually meant you got two days out of it. WATTERS: That's true. PERINO: And now, NASCAR, they're racing right now as I understand while we're on air. WATTERS: Good point. PERINO: And whenever a president is running for reelection, there are complaints about this. Believe me, people were complaining about Barack Obama who was using official funds to go and do really fun things. But I love it. It doesn't matter. You got to -- you have to understand that if you're going to try to compete against him and he's running for reelection, he has all the trappings of the office that make it look better. So you have to -- you have to compensate for that. WATTERS: Yes, he was -- yes, Barack Obama was filling out the brackets on ESPN with the Final Four. I mean, Greg was probably hating on him for that. But you know, I sit back and I realized, you know -- GUTFELD: How can you people ignore the elephant in the room, which is climate change. All those cars going around, the plane coming down and then the other car, disgusting. You know, the lesson here I think is what Emily brought up is in kind of like the mockery that there was a lot of bile on Twitter by the blue checkers towards the group at Daytona, not at the president, but at what they would call the toothless, the redneck, you know the deplorables. This is a thing that the Democrats have to get away from, which is you got to -- you got to stop damning groups because you're not going to win over any hearts by making fun of a massive group of people because they happen to like a certain sport. And I was -- I thought that was bad. But there's - - let's focus on the positive. The guy knows how to put on a show. PERINO: Yes. GUTFELD: I mean, he knows -- and the thing is, if you know -- I think -- I think Donna knows the difference between show and the job. I think it drives people crazy when you can't tell the difference. Like never Trumpers get upset when they see this because they can't see the distinction between show and job, and it freaks them out. But when you see the show and that Trump is having a good time, people having a good time, so what it's fun. And he's good around everybody, man. He could do SNL, he can do Comedy Central, he can do this. I don't think Sanders can do this. WATTERS: No, Sanders, they can't have NASCAR under Sanders. They want to get rid of gasoline. They're going to want a solar-powered cars driving around. It's not going to be that -- GUTFELD: Only in the daytime. (CROSSTALK) BRAZILE: By the way -- by the way, beer -- since we started the show with beer, beer drinkers are bipartisan. GUTFELD: Yes, that's true. COMPAGNO: Yes. BRAZILE: All right. GUTFELD: Not with ice, though. WATTERS: Not with ice, Donna. The airline passenger on the receiving end of that seat punching video, already taking things to the next level. That's story coming up on the ""FASTEST SEVEN."" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) COMPAGNO: Totally amazing. Welcome back. Time for the ""FASTEST SEVEN."" First up, the woman in this viral video of a man punching her plane seat is fighting back, but is she going too far? Wendi, with an I, William says she is deciding whether to sue the man and American Airlines. Meanwhile, the CEO of Delta adding to the reclining seat debate. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ED BASTIAN, CEO, DELTA: I think that the proper thing to do is if you're going to -- you're going to recline into somebody, that you ask if it's OK first and then you do it. (END VIDEO CLIP) COMPAGNO: Greg? GUTFELD: He should resign. OK, because he's in effect saying you don't get what you pay for. For example, if I buy a burger at McDonald's, I don't need permission to eat it at McDonald's. I paid for the burger, I could sit down and eat it, so he's wrong. But I have a solution. I have a solution for this. When you purchase that seat, you buy all the parts of the seat, right, because it's commerce. So why can't someone behind you pay you not to recline? And in fact, he would be purchasing that part of the chair from you. So maybe the person might say, hi, Dana, I'm sitting behind you. I'll buy all of your drinks. If you don't recline, or I'll give you this crisp $50 bill, and then you can decide. Isn't that the solution? WATTERS: Well, if you have a crisp 50, you're not sitting in coach, Greg. GUTFELD: Well, 50 pesos. WATTERS: 50 pesos. I mean, as a valued gold medallion member, I understand what the CEO is saying. The proper thing to do instead of asking, I think you just put it down halfway. You don't go all the way back, but you don't stand up stiff. You go halfway back and call it a day. GUTFELD: That is -- COMPAGNO: Dana? PERINO: Well, some of them don't go halfway. And if you're short, I'm telling you, it is the worst because the seat pushes your head down, it's so annoying. GUTFELD: I hate that. PERINO: And the CEO is probably like 6'5, and doesn't know what it's like to be five-foot-tall. GUTFELD: He flies private. PERINO: Yes. BRAZILE: That's why I spend a lot of time on Southwest Airlines. Honestly, as ""a frequent flyer,"" I am annoyed when people lower their back into my tray and my drink. And it's spill. GUTFELD: But they you lean back. Then you lean back. Everybody is -- BRAZILE: I never lean back. You know why? I don't want anybody smelling me, sniffing on me, like sitting this close. WATTERS: Sniffing your hair? Who does that? BRAZILE: Who does that? GUTFELD: Joe Biden does. BRAZILE: But told be told, that guy was very annoying. PERINO: He was -- he was rude. BRAZILE: He was rude. PERINO: He was not a gentleman. He was not raised right. COMPAGNO: And to your comment about commerce, Greg. The other day when I flew cross country on a different airline, and I saw that there were differently valued seats in the front which said, FYI, these seats do not recline, and so they were valued at less. GUTFELD: Exactly. COMPAGNO: So, therefore, if it plays into actual commerce, then we should be able to avail ourselves of it. BRAZILE: Spoken like a good lawyer. COMPAGNO: Thank you. All right, next up, this may come as a surprise to some. More people died taking selfies than from shark attacks. Between 2011 and 17, over 250 people worldwide died taking their own pictures compared to just 50 who were killed by sharks. BRAZILE: This doesn't surprise me. WATTERS: But you know how most people die? Taking selfies with the shark? That's how you really get killed. COMPAGNO: Double trouble. I mean -- GUTFELD: These are called sui-selfies, sui-selfies. This is what happens when technology gets ahead of humanity, and we haven't figured it out yet. There's a crapload of traffic fatalities before they put in seatbelts. They let it happen. So this is like something that the humanity has all these smartphones and they're just abusing this and will catch up. PERINO: People should just learn to Photoshop themselves into the picture that they want and not die. You know what I mean? GUTFELD: Oh God, I got in trouble for that. BRAZILE: That sounds like -- PERINO: But the National Park Service does have a problem. Like they have to look like warn people, do not try to go out on this ledge and take a selfie. BRAZILE: Yes, it's dangerous. COMPAGNO: I kind of love it. It's Darwin's natural selection. Yes, go out on that ledge. You're that dumb, you want to take a selfie? Bye. All right, finally, over 350 students have their dreams come true when they found out they got into the Mayo Clinic's Medical School. But it turns out it was a monumental mistake. An e-mail glitch caused the school to accidentally send acceptance letters to all applicants instead of just 46 who get it. WATTERS: Well, if I get cancer, I'm not going for treatment there because who knows who's treating me? I mean, these guys could have been like -- they could have been really reaching. COMPAGNO: Those are different departments. WATTERS: Well, I'm not going to take that chance. GUTFELD: Hey, look, it could be worse than getting rejected by Mayo Clinic. You could get accepted by Chico State. I hate you, Chico. On you. Count it. PERINO: Why do you hate -- (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: Because I rented my room at Berkeley to two students from Chico and they stole all my classic Sex Pistols posters and I haven't forgotten, you jerk. That was 1986. COMPAGNO: Amazing. BRAZILE: Greg, what is -- what do you eat that allows you to be -- GUTFELD: It's what I don't eat. BRAZILE: But look, I'm just going to say, if letter mailed tomorrow saying that I was accepted into medical school, I'm going to say return to sender. No way. PERINO: I mean, it's kind of nice to know that even in today's world, instead of basically just accepting all of them and say oh, our mistake, we'll just take you all for what was like a participation trophy, that there were consequences. That's typically doesn't happen anymore. GUTFELD: Sending -- people are sending them jars of mayo. I'm not kidding. I think I read that somewhere. Backcheck me, audience. COMPAGNO: I feel bad for that moment. I mean, can you imagine like that elation? PERINO: You're so excited and then you're not. I hate disappoint. GUTFELD: It's a good lesson for life. You probably learned more in that moment than you did in four years of college. Looking forward to something and then having your dreams crushed, that's life. BRAZILE: No, you got the acceptance letter and then you call the other school that -- and say, I'm not interested. GUTFELD: Yes, that's true. BRAZILE: That's bad business. COMPAGNO: All right, ""ONE MORE THING"" is up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PERINO: It's time now for ""ONE MORE THING."" I'm going to show you something pretty cute. So, dogs are man's best friend, as we know, but also good opponents. Take a look at this dog playing a game. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You go, boy. You got it. You got it. Yes, good job. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: What if he chokes on that? PERINO: All right, that's Percy. He's a two-year-old cockapoo, and he was taught to play Connect the Four by his owner Sarah. She's a Toronto-based dog trainer. And as you can see, Percy is not great, but every once in a while he gets pretty lucky. And yes, as you see here, he wins. He wins one. He's pretty cute. I thought that's a nice way to start a Monday, don't you think? COMPAGNO: Yes, I thought dogs were colorblind. That's so awesome that he can see the colors. BRAZILE: Oh my God. COMPAGNO: Is that a -- oh, I don't know. GUTFELD: I used to go to a bar called the cockapoo. WATTERS: How do you know a dog is colorblind? COMPAGNO: I don't know. Is that a myth? GUTFELD: You see how they dress in the morning. PERINO: Jesse, you're next. WATTERS: All right. I was up in Vermont this weekend skiing with the family at Bromley. There we are here. Elle, Sophie, and Emma. GUTFELD: Your energy level today has been amazing. PERINO: Yes, what's going on? WATTERS: Skiing took a lot out of me, Greg. PERINO: I mean, I've been wondering. Are you all right? WATTERS: It was negative four that day. GUTFELD: I don't think you're Jesse Watters. WATTERS: I was feeling the burr up there in Vermont. It's freezing cold. And if you want to look as good as I did up there on the mountain. Go to shop.foxnews.com where you can get all that nice gear. We have a special President's Day Sale 15 percent off. Go check out the hoodie, socks, and T- shirts, and tumblers, and so much more. GUTFELD: Will the real Jesse be back tomorrow? WATTERS: I thought I was pretty good today, honestly. GUTFELD: No, you seem very tired. WATTERS: Just because I'm not talking in the commercial breaks like you maniacs? GUTFELD: Yes. WATTERS: Just -- everything is fine. GUTFELD: OK, just checking. I was just worried. WATTERS: I'm running out of gas. PERINO: We're worried about you. OK. GUTFELD: All right, let's do this. What is this, animals are great? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Animals are great. Animals are great. Animals are great. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: All right, so this will make you happy. This will make you happy, Jesse. You know why this is a special one, because everybody has a superpower, and even cats have superpowers. For example, this cat can change its size depending on the size of the exit. And so the owner just keeps making it. First, it starts at nine inches. COMPAGNO: That's awesome. GUTFELD: I think that's three inches. WATTERS: Oh my god. COMPAGNO: That's like rats too. GUTFELD: Really, Emily? How would you know that? That's two -- it's two inches. And it's actually -- you know, you get a good scratch when you're doing that. WATTERS: He's trying to make his cat lose weight. COMPAGNO: That's a little harder. GUTFELD: I think that's two inches or is that one inch, I'm not sure. PERINO: He's pretty good. GUTFELD: Yes, there you go. And that is the end. WATTERS: It's a good way to make -- GUTFELD: Smart cat. WATTERS: I thought walls work. BRAZILE: I knew there was a catch. PERINO: All right, Emily, you're next. COMPAGNO: Oh, great. OK, I wanted to tell you guys about this awesome new brewery in Kannapolis, North Carolina. It was founded and totally owned and ran by veterans. One of the coolest things they had, they just had their grand opening. They have a wall inside where anyone can go inside and buy a beer for any member of a branch of the military, first responders, police etcetera, and then they put it up on the board, and then those guys can come in and get that free beer. We had them on Fox earlier. We're so excited about it. So definitely go and hang out near Charlotte. This Saturday in particular, they're releasing its first-ever charitable beer, the Red Line Ale. All proceeds going to the Kannapolis chapter of the firefighters burned children's fund. If you go anywhere near the area, definitely pop in for a drink or two. Buy one for first responders and our military, and also follow them on social media which I believe is a RealOldArmorBeer on Instagram or wherever you can find them. You can find them on my Twitter page too. BRAZILE: Do you have any samples. COMPAGNO: I wish I did. PERINO: I feel like THE FIVE should go there and do a show. GUTFELD: Yes. That sounds like fun. COMPAGNO: Right. And all their beer is military-themed names. WATTERS: I have a feeling they should do a bar like that. And if you want to buy Fox News people drink. That's sounds like a good idea. GUTFELD: You're the real hero? You're the real hero? (CROSSTALK) PERINO: Donna, you're next. BRAZILE: Once again, Kobe Bryant. Last night the NBA saluted a wonderful basketball player, humanitarian. Grammy Award winner Jennifer Hudson did the great honor of singing this remarkable song. Kobe Bryant will be remembered not just as a great basketball player but also a humanitarian. So God bless your family. God bless all of the other victims of the helicopter crash. Kobe, we miss you already. PERINO: All right. Jesse, are you going to recharge tonight? WATTERS: Yes, I'm going to recharge the battery. I'll be back here tomorrow. GUTFELD: My sister says Jesse needs to lay off the Ambien. PERINO: Set your DVRs, never miss an episode of ""The Five."" GUTFELD: Low energy Watters. PERINO: ""Special Report"" is up next. Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

78,FOX,"Disgraced attorney Michael Avenatti faces up to 42 years in prison; reaction on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" February 14, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: I look forward, Joe, my friend. Enjoy Vegas. In the meantime, the acting Homeland Security Secretary, Chad Wolf will be joining us tomorrow, along with the acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker when he is looking at what is happening now after this.  (CROSSTALK)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK. No problem at all.  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino, along with Emily Compagno, Juan Williams, Lawrence Jones, and Greg Gutfeld, looking at me. It's five o'clock in New York City and this is The Five.  A tornado of breaking news coming out of Washington. New outrage over the sentencing of Roger Stone. Attorney General Bill Barr criticizing President Trump for tweeting about the case but adding that he was not pressured by the White House to intervene. Of course, some Democrats are not buying that explanation.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think it's very important to question the sincerity of the attorney general, and I think that's why the president's response was so muted.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I would not be surprised, Erin, if the attorney general and the president did -- were not in cahoots in terms of Barr making a public statement.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What the attorney general is really saying is I know what President Trump wants, I'm going to do exactly what Trump wants. I just wish he wouldn't tweet about it because it is so embarrassing.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: And calls for the attorney general to resign are intensifying. Nine Senate Democrats signing a letter, they signed a letter, Greg, demanding that Barr step aside.  Plus, the Justice Department announcing today that it is dropping the investigation into former FBI official Andrew McCabe. McCabe was accused of lying under oath about a media leak. And we are learning that A.G. Barr has hired an outside prosecutor to review the handling of former national security advisor Michael Flynn's case.  So this reminds me a little bit, Greg, when I worked with the Justice Department, there was a guy named Michael Isikoff, right, from Newsweek at the time --  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Yes.  PERINO: -- and he would call on like Fridays at five p.m. and say I've got a big scoop that's going to break on Sunday. I'm like, why didn't you do this all week? I know you're going to run the weekend. Now we have all this news breaking out on Friday.  GUTFELD: This isn't -- this isn't breaking news to me, though. This is what I called the weeds.  PERINO: It is weeds.  GUTFELD: We are -- we are in the weeds. Think about this. Step back. This is the media's big story right now after everything from collusion to impeachment, what they have right now is a story about Bill Barr and President Trump and tweeting.  That's their big story. This reminds me when I was young and broke and I would come home and open up my refrigerator and there'd be nothing to eat so I made like, I make ketchup and saltine cracker sandwiches.  PERINO: Those were good.  GUTFELD: This story is a ketchup and saltine cracker sandwiches. They are. The media is busy trying to make something out of this. You know, I don't care about Roger Stone. I don't care about any of this stuff. I know that he got screwed and he should have a new trial but we're only doing the story because the media want you to.  It's like, you know what it's like, when somebody asked you to babysit their kid and it turns out the kid is a monster. That's the media. Everyday America has to babysit the media because the media throws a new tantrum every single day and we are forced to go over and check on the little baby. OK, are you OK, CNN, what's wrong, MSNBC.  But here, it's stupid. It's stupid. All you got to do is you got to go. There was a weird juror, right, the sentencing was bad. Roger Stone not a wholesome character but he needs a new trial. That's it. Let's go to the big block.  PERINO: And the judge --  (CROSSTALK)  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: You are trying -- you are trying to give America sleeping pills. It's the media. How about its President Trump defying all the norms that say the Justice Department and our legal system, pillars of our great country, should not subject -- be subject to interference from a president who thinks he's an authoritarian king.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: What's the interference again?  WILLIAMS: Let me get this straight.  GUTFELD: What's the interference again? Be specific.  WILLIAMS: He said -- I'll be specific.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: I can't believe I'm arguing.  WILLIAMS: He wants -- he wants to protect his friends, he wants to protect Roger Stone and stay, you know what, you shouldn't be sentenced that. Bill Barr then acts, and then Bill Barr says, wait, President Trump, even me, even Bill Barr, your buddy says, you know what, you make my job tougher by tweeting.  So, either, either Trump blew the cover by admitting that he was trying to influence Barr or Barr is sincerely saying, hey, President Trump, you've gone over the line.  I've got four prosecutors quitting and now I'm going to tell you what, I'm going to let Andrew McCabe escape because in this moment, I can get away with that with you but I'll tell you what I give you something else on the side, now I'm going to go after the people who prosecuted Michael Flynn, your other friend -- what kind of government is this? Is this the media or is this --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: He's not -- I don't think that --  GUTFELD: That is a saltine ketchup sandwich, Juan Williams --  WILLIAMS: No. I'll tell you what. For you this is rims (ph). You could be Fred Flintstone with the ribs on the side of your --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Don't make me hungry, Juan.  WILLIAMS: There is such --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: You know you're trying to make me hungry.  WILLIAMS: No, no. But there is so much going on and you are saying to our audience, just ignore it. it's just --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Because our audience is smart. Our audience has to filter.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: Can I -- can I play a little sound --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: There is little news. Even Dana Perino is saying a tornado is coming out of Washington  PERINO: I didn't write that.  WILLIAMS: My God. Look at -- ran your run.  PERINO: I'm not running.  WILLIAMS: You're running away.  PERINO: Hey, did you watch the two o'clock show? We had breaking news on anyway.  When I hear about the media say they're thinking about Bill Barr, you want to watch that? OK, watch it.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  MIKA BRZEZINSKI, MSNBC HOST: What he's saying is that these tweets make it harder for Bill Barr to help him be corrupt.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What Bill Barr was saying in that interview with Peter Thomas yesterday was that the president has been making it harder for the team to win.  JOHN BERMAN, CNN HOST: The infantilization of the president, I don't think he's going to be able to take it. They're basically saying the baby can't use his cell phone, we have to take the cell phone away from the baby.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  LAWRENCE JONES, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: First of all, Bill Barr said that he got the timeline wrong too. So that's not what was happening. So, I think that's important to fix the time --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: I think that's why he did the ABC News interview.  JONES: Exactly. Exactly. And there is another thing here. We're not dealing with a Jeff Sessions attorney general. This is not someone that is weak and doesn't have long-standing respect amongst both political parties.  What Bill Barr is saying, look, you hired me to do a job. You should trust me to do it. You said there was a corruption, I've started investigations, I had independent investigations, I've hired Jonathan Durham to investigate this. Just hold on a little bit, let me do what I need to do.  He also said that when trials are going on and there are judges being attacked, that hurts the prosecution. And so, what the attorney general was doing, he was defending his department but he was also defending the things that Democrats are criticizing the president of, which is independence.  The attorney general said I am independent but I am also a political appointee. He also said, also, it's not all the tweets that I'm concerned about. The president can talk about politics, criticize his political opponents all day. It just when it go -- happens to be the Justice Department where it's an issue for him.  And I think Democrats also when it comes to these charges, I thought you guys didn't want nonviolent offenders to be behind bars, so there seems to be a little bit of inconsistency --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: You know he lied.  JONES: -- of criminal --  WILLIAMS: He lied. You know he lied.  JONES: -- again, non-violent offender.  GREG: You know every politician would be in prison for that.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: We can't have justice if I tamper with you as a witness.  JONES: So, my thing is --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: That's what he did.  GUTFELD: No, wait. Wait.  PERINO: Can we get Emily in?  GUTFELD: Are you talking about the jurors?  JONES: I'm not saying the guy is a --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: No, I'm talking about --  JONES: I'm not saying the guy is innocent but the Democrats position has been the child want non-violent offender on the street.  WILLIAMS: Hey, are you --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: OK. Emily gets her turn. Emily?  WILLIAMS: You must be confused with --  JONES: This is a non-violent offender.  WILLIAMS: You're confused with drug people, that's what you --  (CROSSTALK)  JONES: I said non-violent.  PERINO: Emily? Jump in. Jump in.  EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS HOST: I think what impresses me the most about this is the approach to this that prosecutors are somehow infallible. And I think the notion that up until now, up until this administration, somehow there has been a complete acceptance of the opacity and we just take whatever comes down but what's wrong with the investigations? What's wrong with transparency?  And to your point, I agree with you, and that, if you are want to understand that the original sentencing guidelines that right now there's an entire movement to deconstruct by the way, that was for a little over two years, and there was an eight-level enhancement levied on Roger Stone to make it to nine years for physical threatening of a witness which when you --  WILLIAMS: Yes.  COMPAGNO: -- it's like if you pick up a quarter at a bank and then you get charged with an enhancement of bank robbery. These prosecutors were shoving in a thin set of facts to fill this --  JONES: You get a plea.  COMPAGNO: -- large enhancement that doesn't quite fit. And in terms of the A.G.'s response, part of the reason that they were so frustrated and the top brass came out and amended and filed that amended sentencing requirement or request is because that is not what the prosecutors told them.  It wasn't just that they disagreed with the enhancement. It is that the briefings up until then hadn't given -- haven't -- hadn't told them about it. So, they said, look, we are stepping in to file an amended brief and we as citizens should applaud that.  We should applaud the fact that the brass is stepping in and not just say, it's the prosecutors. That's what they're doing. Everyone always takes briefs and police reports and everything as truth. It's not always. This amendment says --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: And also, Bill Barr in that interview he didn't defend Roger Stone --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: No, he didn't.  PERINO: -- on the acts then do that at all. He was just talking about that.  COMPAGNO: Exactly.  WILLIAMS: Let me just say. Let me just say.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: We got to move on. I'm tired of this topic.  WILLIAMS: Wait, wait. But before we go --  GUTFELD: I want to talk about Michael Avenatti, Juan. Come on.  WILLIAMS: I know. Because you love the vindictiveness.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: What are you talking about? I love victory.  WILLIAMS: But let me just say. You would say because Avenatti was going after --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: You can't handle the truth, Juan.  WILLIAMS: That's it.  GUTFELD: You can't handle it.  PERINO: You guys are going to --  WILLIAMS: Look, let me just say --  GUTFELD: Saltines and ketchup.  WILLIAMS: If you had --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: He was supposed to --  WILLIAMS: If you had the A.G. as not a guy who was not spinning the Mueller report, not the guy saying I'm willing to take dirt from Giuliani in order to get Biden, he would have a better case.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: He said he was glad that Roger Stone was convicted.  WILLIAMS: Yes.  PERINO: That's what Bill Barr said.  Next up, Michael Bloomberg coming under attack from 2020 Democrats. Plus, protesters heckle Joe Biden, if you can believe that. Next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  JONES: The 2020 Democrats are eating their own after her failed attempt to smear Bernie Sanders as a sexist. Elizabeth Warren is back attacking Mike Bloomberg as a racist.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Michael Bloomberg is saying in effect that the 2008 financial crash was caused because the banks weren't permitted to discriminate against black and brown people.  That crisis would not have been averted if the banks were not able to be bigger racists.  (APPLAUSE)  WARREN: And anyone who thinks that should not be the leader of our party.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  JONES: And Joe Biden week has bene kept off by protesters telling him to get out of the race.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Drop out, Joe.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Skip Nevada, skip South Carolina. Just go home early.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  JONES: Dana, the attacks finally started in the Democratic Party and everyone's criminal justice background has been tested. Biden with the crime bill, Mayor Pete, what he's done in his city.  PERINO: Yes.  JONES: Harris and Klobuchar as a D.A. And now it's Bloomberg. Is it a fair game?  PERINO: And Warren really doesn't have much to say about it, right? I saw in the banking thing. Biden didn't have like a terrible week. I mean, he had a terrible start to the week, but he got today a couple of endorsements in Nevada that put him may be like, maybe back in play a little bit there and from an African-American legislator there.  So, I think it's still so wide open. And what this, what you're really showing is like this debate between the pragmatic Democrats who want to make President Trump a one-term president, and then this battle for the heart and soul of the liberal wing of the Democratic Party.  And if it turned out that it was Trump versus Bloomberg, it was so be interesting. Right. Because then you would have an incumbent Republican who used to be a Democrat versus a Democratic nominee who used to be a Republican. And everything is mixed around and all mixed up in everything, and so I still feel like it is kind of a wide-open race with President Trump obviously favorite to win.  JONES: Juan, it seems like with Bloomberg, especially Biden that all of this is going back to the black vote. Everyone keeps talking about South Carolina and Nevada, specifically about South Carolina. Is that enough for Biden? The black vote?  WILLIAMS: It's very important. It was at 60 percent of the vote in South Carolina in the Democratic primaries, it's black. And you got this upcoming weekend, I think it's 40 percent -- not this weekend, I should say, but the next weekend, 40 percent of the vote in Nevada --  COMPAGNO: Nevada.  WILLIAMS: -- is black and Hispanic. Mostly Hispanic.  JONES: Yes.  WILLIAMS: And so, this is really critical. Now I don't think that it's a case of Democrats eating their own. I think this has been a pretty benign primary process by that measure. I mean, obviously you go back to 2016 in the Republican side, you saw how vicious and name calling I mean, got worse in that because that was the GOP establishment almost collectively against Trump.  But in this case, I think the things that we are talking about here, the idea that, it was black and Hispanics who cause the financial crisis? I can't believe that Bloomberg -- that's ridiculous. That's --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: That's not what he said.  WILLIAMS: He said that if the bank --  PERINO: No.  WILLIAMS: -- if in fact, he said --  PERINO: That's not what he said.  WILLIAMS: Tell me what you think he said.  PERINO: OK. So, basically, he was saying that that process of redlining, that giving loans leading up to the financial crisis to people who did not have the financial means to be able to pay those loans back but they are in a terrible position and help to celebrate the financial crisis.  WILLIAMS: No, what he said --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: The question about the mortgage part of the financial crisis is quite well-known.  WILLIAMS: No. What he said was slightly different. He said it was redlining.  PERINO: Right.  WILLIAMS: Redlining is the -- am I right?  PERINO: Yes, yes. And he was --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: OK. Redlining is the practice of discrimination, Dana. And in this case, the idea of --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: And it had been eliminated as a policy.  WILLIAMS: Right. Well, that's a good thing to eliminate discrimination in my book. But here's the thing. A lot of that financial crisis was caused by people flipping properties, thinking they could make some quick money, or, guess what, we had government, in fact Republicans who said home ownership is an ideal in America. We want to encourage homeownership.  It was not intended to somehow say people who can't afford it should go out -- no, that's not it. And for him to say that, you know, especially coming from the aftermath of stop and frisk, it's got to make you concerned.  JONES: I want to stay on Bloomberg because he's now, he was in Houston yesterday apologizing for the stop and frisk. Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  MICHAEL BLOOMBERG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: And I delete -- deeply regret the abuse of a police practice called stop and frisk. I defended it, looking back for too long because I didn't understand then the unintended pain it was causing to young black and brown families and their kids. I should have acted sooner and faster to stop it. I didn't. And for that, I apologize.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  JONES: Greg, I want to get you to weigh in on this. Me, personally, I'm against stop and frisk. All of this is profiling to the highest order. What he said was the definition of racial profiling. And quite frankly, the people that he was talking about, that would've been me. If I would have lived in New York City --  PERINO: Yes.  JONES: -- I would have been in Harlem or the Bronx being pulled over. It's just not right.  GUTFELD: Well, first off, if the Dems actually eat their own, they'll all get food poisoning.  PERINO: You'll give some antibiotics.  GUTFELD: Yes, exactly. Look, I enjoy this part because what you're seeing you're seeing the left apply the same kind of process that they have been applying to everybody out -- everybody else, which is canceling you based on past actions according to present standards. Right?  Now we know that it's wrong. I don't believe Bloomberg thought it was discrimination when he thought stop and frisk was an important thing. I believe, and I still do, that there were groups in New York City that were pleading for help in their communities. That they have a lot of gang violence, that there were guns on the street, and this was a way to get them off.  Now you are in the present day and you're looking back, that's discrimination. What doesn't -- what kind of gets me mad is in the grand scheme of things that's a mistake. You could say that's a mistake.  But what's the biggest mistake by anybody? Supporting totalitarian regimes that have killed millions. So, for some reason the Democratic Party sees a problem with stop and frisk but they don't see a problem with Bernie Sanders --  PERINO: It's a great point.  GUTFELD: -- you know, supporting totalitarianism when he was younger while there was this free, this free society called America that he took advantage of for so long? They, and I think the reason is because the Democratic Party agrees with Bernie, that America is the oppressor, and that Cuba, the USSR, they are the oppressed. Because that decision is, that decision that America is a moral evil? And that the USSR was actually the oppressed? That's a far worse thing than stop and frisk or talking about redlining.  PERINO: Yes.  JONES: What about the --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: In fact, James Carville has kind of been the only Democrat that has walked up to that line?  GUTFELD: Yes, yes, exactly.  JONES: What about that, Emily, because he still receives the mayor's endorsement who's the best (Inaudible) mayor in Houston.  PERINO: Sylvia.  COMPAGNO: Right. And I think what's so -- what's so interesting about that, we saw it from the Bernie bros and from Elizabeth Warren in 2016 against Hillary Clinton, right? And the difference however was that Hillary Clinton already had this path to inevitability.  But here Bloomberg isn't there yet. So, this actually might have a greater impact, and negative impact going forward. But I think that Elizabeth Warren and her comments about the regulations for the banking industry and what she's talking about with that has -- I think there are people who are quaking in their boots right now, that financial health and the camel system will be based in part on a diversity and inclusion rating that is totally separate from the value of a dollar I think will go so far behind closed doors.  And the money that Bloomberg has will propel him past all of that because as Warren is essentially hemorrhaging out, Nevada also is Biden's last chance, and all of those monies are going to go anywhere but to him. That's his last chance to prove viability.  WILLIAMS: All right. We got to leave it there. Michael Avenatti is headed to the big house. The anti-Trump lawyer found guilty in his extortion trial with Nike. We'll talk about that, next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WILLIAMS: Welcome back to your favorite show.  More bad news for Michael Avenatti, the lawyer and one-time presidential hopeful found guilty on all three counts after trying to extort Nike for $25 million.  Avenatti faces up to 42 years in prison. He has two other criminal trials set for later this year. The media now being criticized for having given him a platform.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  CHRIS CUOMO, HOST, CNN: You got lucky tonight. We're back with attorney Michael Avenatti, he is a main player.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sitting beside me right now. I'm not going to let you cheat, you have to guess. Hint, his name is Michael Avenatti.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look, I think you're doing a hell of a job. I don't think you're in this for money.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have never seen anyone pander to an audience like you just did. How dare you, sir.  CHRIS MATTHEWS, HOST, MSNBC: You're something else. Michael Avenatti, I'd like to meet you sometime over a dinner.  DON LEMON, HOST, CNN: Thank you, Michael Cohen. Michael Cohen -- Michael Avenatti.  MICHAEL AVENATTI, FORMER STORMY DANIEL'S ATTORNEY: Please, whatever you do, call me anything other than Michael Cohen.  LEMON: That was good, though.  AVENATTI: Not really.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: Soulmate.  WILLIAMS: And now this prediction from Avenatti is getting a lot of attention after what happened today.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  AVENATTI: I'm going to say it again. Mr. Trump will not serve out his term. No way, know-how, he will be forced to ultimately resign.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: Greg, I know it's like ribs on a Friday night for you.  GUTFELD: It is Christmas.  WILLIAMS: You are chomping at this one, so go for it.  GUTFELD: I felt like we should've led with this and done an entire hour and I'll tell you why. We saw him, and when I mean we, I mean The Five and the viewers, we saw him for what he was. But you those clowns from the montage, they couldn't, because they had a derange filter.  So, all they saw when they look at this clown with somebody that could hurt so they're -- they are lined up to kiss his, you know, the bald bozos ring. He -- Stelter who said he was a prime contender for the presidency.  This is a piece of evidence that shows you that the corporate media cannot be trusted because there's -- these are -- these are people that consider themselves more sophisticated than all of us but they are credulous. They'll take in anybody. They're like a tribe looking for a savior and that's what they saw in this guy.  So, my big point is, for all those people that were in that montage, because I know they watch The Five, it's really a positive thing to admit that you're wrong, but it's even more positive to figure out why you were wrong. Because it's like opening a portal that you didn't know you had. It's a great thing to do.  So, the media that are so wrong on this, you don't have to admit it, you don't have to admit, but you need to spend some time to figure out why you were wrong. And why -- what flawed view cause you to see this guy, because you look at no street smarts, now Midwestern common sense, those were the things that could have helped you see this guy for what he is.  And it's absent on CNN, in MSNBC, the Washington Post, they don't have one person on their staff that saw this for what it was. That's got to make you go home and go like, what in God's name is wrong with my filter? What do I have to change?  WILLIAMS: All right. So, Dana.  GUTFELD: Thank you.  WILLIAMS: Greg and I -- Greg and I disagree on this because I think part of the fascination with Avenatti was Stormy Daniels.  PERINO: Yes.  WILLIAMS: And the fact that she was a porn star and she is saying the president paid her off, and then the check is found, in fact there was his signature and all that. The thing is though, Avenatti now faces a new -- another trial. There are two more. One of them is for in fact ripping off Stormy Daniels.  PERINO: Right. And there's like even yet another one too.  WILLIAMS: There's another one for ripping off a paraplegic.  PERINO: Right. That was -- yes.  WILLIAMS: It's unbelievable.  PERINO: I mean, obviously, we are not dealing with somebody who has --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Of high character.  PERINO: No. He's very low character.  GUTFELD: This isn't a fall from grace.  PERINO: Not a fall from grace. New to (Inaudible).  WILLIAMS: By the way, you know, --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: A long way to go to get from grace.  WILLIAMS: If he was convicted on all three -- he was convicted on one today. He could end up in jail, you're going to have to visit him, Greg.  GUTFELD: I will.  WILLIAMS: 400 years, 400 years.  GUTFELD: I'll do it.  PERINO: I mean, is anyone going to step in and ask for his son to be --  WILLIAMS: Maybe we can get Trump in here.  GUTFELD: He should pardon him.  WILLIAMS: Because Stormy is his friend.  PERINO: But you know, this is the second in two days of stories like this turning out that the media has had it wrong. You had Jussie Smollett and now he was indicted this week. Now you have Avenatti convicted by a jury.  GUTFELD: Covington.  PERINO: And well, you have just taken up this week. But there's one example after another going on around here.  JONES: Well, Juan, you said it was about Stormy. I don't think it was about Stormy. It was about any person that they felt that could take on Donald Trump. And I think that they didn't do proper vetting of the stories. I mean, they could have just talked to Stormy and she would have told -- I mean, there were back and forth messages that anybody was around.  She's saying that look, this guy is taking my money. I've never received my money. They could have went to the original source on a lot of this stuff. But some of his comments in the past was that the President was not going to serve his full term. I think he's ready to finish that term. He said that Don Jr. was going to be behind bars. Looks like you're going to be behind bars.  So this is not a guy that was a smart person. He went after Nike. You think you're the first person that tried to extort Nike, and you thought you're going to win?  GUTFELD: They're making him foot the bill.  PERINO: Just do it.  WILLIAMS: What do you got to say? You're a lawyer.  COMPAGNO: Yes, I think this is an example of the squeaky wheel gets the grease where he was basically this such a loud obtuse person that somehow he was given all of that media and that airspace. And meanwhile, you know, all the time in the mainstream media, we hear words like, oh, this administration and this president, it's corrupt, and they believe and they extort.  That should be reserved for someone like this. That second trial that you just mentioned in the intro, that's a 36 count indictment. That -- this is not a small, low level, gray area situation. This human is despicable. He's a complete embarrassment to my profession. And I think the fact that he was given such a mouthpiece for so long without that vetting or without any -- I mean, he was like the Emperor's New Clothes living in this lavish palace.  He was -- yes, he was thieving from a disabled people and -- to buy a private jet because he was in debt $15 million. And meanwhile, his defense attorney is literally part of their argument, part of their strategy and trial on which he was found guilty of all three counts in this one in New York was well he just did it. Nike, just do it.  They literally were like, he just did it. So you of all people should appreciate that this is simply an aggressive attorney. You guys have heard the phone call when he is screaming and shouting and using profane language. That's that is threatening and intimidation. You want to talk about that -- you know, Roger Stone, that's nothing compared to this.  WILLIAMS: Well, you know, I mean, I just think that if -- let me go back. If Clinton, Bush, Obama, we're paying off a porn star, I don't think who they'll -- care who the lawyer was. He was going to get a lot of time on air.  GUTFELD: Well, you got to pay the porn star.  WILLIAMS: All right -- what do you say?  GUTFELD: You got to pay the porn star.  WILLIAMS: Oh, sorry, sorry.  GUTFELD: In New York, that's what you do.  WILLIAMS: Is that right? OK, I'm going to have more. Time for some fast fun. The ""FASTEST SEVEN"" is up next on THE FIVE.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  COMPAGNO: Welcome back time for the ""FASTEST SEVEN."" President Trump may have a plan to plant one trillion trees to protect the environment. But these activists think it's better to do it with a song.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: -- hole in the sky where the tree once was. Somebody is making money. There's a hole in the sky where the tree you once was. Somebody making money.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  COMPAGNO: Juan, how many rehearsals Do you think they had before that city council performance?  WILLIAMS: I think they were at the Seahawk Stadium. I don't know. But -- so this has gone viral, right? Everybody is watching this and I think that it's funny. You know, obviously, they're committed and they're passionate. I can appreciate it. But it's everybody's watching this, including people who are opposed to the idea that these are environmental actors because they look like they could be made easily made fun of.  COMPAGNO: Lawrence, would you employ that strategy?  JONES: No. I just think they could be doing stuff that's so much effective, doing community garden, you know, planting trees and neighborhoods and all that, but they're so divisive. And even if you want to get on your team, I don't know --  WILLIAMS: Why are they divisive?  JONES: At least -- at least they're just singing this time instead of burning stuff up.  WILLIAMS: Why do you say divisive? Why is that divisive?  JONES: No, what I'm saying is that this is not encouraging people to be a part of the movement. They're just disrupting a city -- a city council.  PERINO: But look -- so they're complaining because Seattle is growing so quickly and a lot of trees have to be cut down in order to make room for the growth and trees are an important part of any city. If you look at some place like Greenville, South Carolina, it was like 20 years ago, the mayor -- maybe 25 years ago, said we're going to spend this money to plant trees and everyone was furious because they spend that money. And now it's like the most beautiful strip and everybody loves it. So they're just -- they just want their trees and they came up with a song and it's cute.  COMPAGNO: Yes, Greg, do you think it's kind of immature and infantilizing or do you think it's actually effective in some way?  GUTFELD: I don't believe in either of those assumptions, Emily. I'll take that over some guy hitting me with a bike lock, or throwing -- or throwing milkshakes on people, right? I'll take that any day. But imagine how the media would treat them if they were thinking about the unborn and not the trees.  COMPAGNO: Right. Good point.  GUTFELD: Thank you, Emily.  COMPAGNO: You're welcome. All right, next up. If you haven't heard of the term hungry, it's when you get really upset because you need to eat. According to a study, being hungry can cause a lot of heated disagreements and lead to an average of four arguments per week.  PERINO: I know this.  COMPAGNO: So have you guys have seen those Snickers commercials, right, where basically when you're so hungry, you're like a different person. And I haven't --  WILLIAMS: Wait, Dana says she knows this.  PERINO: No, so this -- yes, I can be somebody like I'm not hungry, I'm not hungry, not hungry, and like I'm going to eat somebody's arm if they don't right now. And so Peter used to -- we used to get into argument because he's like, well, why didn't you eat? And I'm like, don't ask me why I didn't eat. I had all these things to do. And so now though, it's very sweet. Like when we go anywhere, if we're going down to the shore, or if we're going to go on an airplane, he has a little -- he packs little snacks for me, just in case. It's very sweet.  COMPAGNO: To stave off hungry Dana.  PERINO: Every day is Valentine's Day at my house people. Everyday.  COMPAGNO: Greg, what about you?  GUTFELD: This is why robots are necessary. They don't get tired, they don't get hungry. Think about the number of fatalities that were caused by drowsiness or impatient or distraction or injustice. Think about injustice. There was a study, I'd mentioned it here before, that the eating habits of judges have a direct impact on the sentences they give out.  So when they are in a bad mood, they will deny you parole, but if they go to lunch, they're less likely to do that. So the thing is, we need to replace all our judges with artificial intelligence and we will never have the -- whatever --we'll never have the Roger Stone experience again. Thank you very much. I just solved all of our problems. You're welcome, America.  WILLIAMS: I think you don't like people.  GUTFELD: I hate people.  WILLIAMS: I think so.  JONES: No, this is totally me. I mean, 90 percent of the time, if I'm angry, or just upset, annoyed, it's because I haven't eaten.  COMPAGNO: Yes, totally.  GUTFELD: I'm like that when I eat or don't.  WILLIAMS: Wait a minute. I'm supposed to attack you. You're not supposed to attack yourself. But I don't -- I don't think being hungry is any reason to treat people poorly, right? I mean, that's not an excuse. If you --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Tell you what, when --  JONES: I always apologize.  WILLIAMS: You always apologize. You're a kind spirit. But I'm going to say I get headaches if I don't eat.  PERINO: Yes.  WILLIAMS: So I mean, I'm kind of you know, upset with myself.  COMPAGNO: It just goes to my patients, you know, whether I'm like, oh, no problem, or like, no, you can go and do that right now. Anyway, finally, Happy Valentine's Day, America. And for all of you haters out there. Here's a way to ruin the day for that special someone. It's called a Valentightning. It's, ""the heartbreaking act of dumping someone right before Valentine's Day because you're too tight to get them a gift, write a card, or make any kind of fuss. Lawrence?  WILLIAMS: Oh my goodness.  JONES: No, I didn't dare do that.  GUTFELD: You do it the day before?  JONES: I did not do that.  GUTFELD: Or did you do that the day after?  JONES: I would -- I would never do that.  COMPAGNO: Do you need to share something with us?  JONES: No, I would never do that. Two days before.  COMPAGNO: OK. Did those come into play? Were you like -- tell us about your decision.  PERINO: Oh, no, we should. No, no.  GUTFELD: Wait, Lawrence, we brought her in.  WILLIAMS: Oh no. Yes, this is great. What a show. What a show.  (CROSSTALK)  COMPAGNO: Was it a litmus -- was it a litmus for you where you like. I'm not going to get to that --  GUTFELD: Emily, what are you doing for Valentine's Day?  COMPAGNO: Greg, it's not about me.  GUTFELD: I'm trying to save him.  COMPAGNO: Well, fine. (INAUDIBLE) if you're like I don't want to hit that milestone.  JONES: No, I really want to break up with her to begin with. And I was calculating --  WILLIAMS: OK. Hey, hey, this is way too personal here.  COMPAGNO: No, I was just -- because I care about --  GUTFELD: Oh, if you cared about me him, you wouldn't have brought it up.  COMPAGNO: Juan, what say you about Valentighting?  WILLIAMS: Well, I don't even understand this topic. Let's just be nice --  GUTFELD: I think you ruined this whole thing.  COMPAGNO: I think I made it amazing. All right, ""FAN MAIL FRIDAY"" is up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: All right, ""FAN MAIL FRIDAY."" To continue on this topic from Linda, what is the worst Valentine's celebration you ever had? I'm thinking Lawrence it's today at THE FIVE:  PERINO: Five minutes ago.  GUTFELD: Is this the worst Valentine you've ever had?  JONES: Yes, because of Dana.  GUTFELD: Why Dana? I thought it was Emily who brought it up.  COMPAGNO: You can't blame me for everything.  PERINO: It was me.  JONES: It was Dana. We'll talk about this.  PERINO: It was me, but it's going to get better. Your Valentine's Day is going to get better.  JONES: OK.  GUTFELD: Did you get -- did you get the gifts that you gave her back or you --  JONES: Oh my God.  WILLIAMS: Oh my God.  GUTFELD: All right, all right. Emily, what's your worst Valentine's celebration?  JONES: You broke a --  COMPAGNO: I never had a bad one. I don't -- I don't --  GUTFELD: Of course not.  COMPAGNO: No, I just -- I don't really -- like if I wasn't -- I just -- it was no big deal. Whatever.  GUTFELD: Oh wait, Dana, you had a bad --  PERINO: It was -- Peter and I had a great -- we were great together but we -- he took me to the Bahamas and it was our first time together away. We went to the Bahamas and the weather was terrible, the food was terrible, like everything was terrible, and I'm never been back to the Bahamas.  GUTFELD: And it's expensive when you're buying two rooms. Juan. True. I know your mom's watching. I just want to make sure.  PERINO: You feel better now, Juan?  GUTFELD: Juan?  WILLIAMS: It's really hard to see tattoos from it. So I haven't had a bad one, but I tell you what happens afterwards.  GUTFELD: Yes.  WILLIAMS: It's like if you're traveling a lot, and I used to travel a lot for campaigns, and then you forget. And you come home and somebody kind of icy.  GUTFELD: Oh yes.  WILLIAMS: Like you know, didn't --  PERINO: You forgot?  WILLIAMS: You didn't act right?  JONES: You deserve that.  WILLIAMS: Well, you know who we're talking about.  GUTFELD: This is not a problem -- not a problem when you marry a Russian because they don't have Valentine's Day. They have International Women's Day which --  PERINO: It's a big one.  GUTFELD: Which is kind of some weird commie thing. But I always say -- I don't have to participate in either because you know, I don't know that one, and she doesn't know this one, so I'm in good shape. I didn't like when I was a kid and they gave me -- they did the whole card.  PERINO: I love the cards.  GUTFELD: I hated it when there are kids that didn't get any.  PERINO: No, you always get --  COMPAGNO: Everyone gets one.  GUTFELD: No, it's the generation. When I was growing up, they just let the kid with no cards sit there.  PERINO: That's not good.  COMPAGNO: That's horrible.  GUTFELD: It was horrible, Emily.  WILLIAMS: What about -- what about -- you know what I like, those candies with a little thing --  GUTFELD: That's the worst, cheapest candy ever.  WILLIAMS: That's bad candy? Is it worse than the candy corns?  GUTFELD: Yes. Candy corns are like -- it's like golden -- anyway, Lindy asked -- it's really one time for one question. What is your biggest goal for the future? Who wants to go first?  PERINO: I just want to get through 2020.  GUTFELD: That's your biggest goal?  PERINO: For the future. That's as far as I can see.  GUTFELD: Emily, you look like you're having problems.  COMPAGNO: Well, it's not my biggest goal but I would like to add to my collection of 78 Trans Am with -- in solar gold.  WILLIAMS: Solar -- the color of the car?  COMPAGNO: It's solar -- it was only -- it came out to California just for two years.  GUTFELD: Oh, interesting. Where are you going to keep it?  COMPAGNO: That's why in the future -- it's a goal. I have to get a garage first.  GUTFELD: There you go. Start with the garage. Lawrence? Biggest goal for the future, changing your phone number.  JONES: That would be all of them. I want to make movies.  GUTFELD: Oh, that's good idea.  COMPAGNO: Like directing?  JONES: Yes.  COMPAGNO: Can I be in one?  JONES: Of course.  GUTFELD: You don't want to get in those movies.  COMPAGNO: This is a family show.  GUTFELD: It is a family show. They don't know what I'm talking about. Kids don't know what I'm talking about.  WILLIAMS: Yes, it was -- he's talking about slasher movies.  GUTFELD: Yes.  COMPAGNO: OK. Thank you.  GUTFELD: Juan, biggest goal for the future.  WILLIAMS: You know what, I used to run a lot, and now my time is bad, Greg. So I think you know, despite aging, I would like to somehow lower that time.  GUTFELD: 10 -- I want 10 pounds.  JONES: Are you going to join him?  GUTFELD: What? I want to lose 10 pounds. Yes. I don't where though.  PERINO: I also want to go work in Africa.  GUTFELD: You're so wonderful.  PERINO: Actually, what I want to do, I'm going to ask for a sabbatical in a few years.  GUTFELD: Oh, it's not sweet.  PERINO: I mean, I'm just putting it out there.  GUTFELD: Well, that's good for you. Go work in Africa.  PERINO: Do you want to go with me?  GUTFELD: I'm busy. So just -- I don't know. I'm just busy.  PERINO: What will you be doing?  GUTFELD: I don't know. I'll be working in my apartment for Africa.  WILLIAMS: He's doing -- he's doing partnership lessons for alarm.  GUTFELD: There you go. There you go.  WILLIAMS: Love lessons from Greg.  GUTFELD: Well, this is going -- ""ONE MORE THING"" up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PERINO: It's time now for ""ONE MORE THING."" And I have this for you.  GUTFELD: Here we go.  PERINO: Corny jokes for them. Are you ready? OK, why do skunks love Valentine's Day?  COMPAGNO: Stinky, free, straight? They love.  GUTFELD: They love.  COMPAGNO: It's like brainstorming, you guys. Come on, get with me. Why do I always miss the joke?  PERINO: Why do skunks love Valentine's Day because they're sentimental animal. OK, OK.  GUTFELD: This is now the funniest thing ever watching her do this.  PERINO: OK. How did the telephone propose to its girlfriend?  COMPAGNO: Rings, by rings, with the ring?  PERINO: It gave her a ring.  COMPAGNO: Yes. My first one I got. Why?  PERINO: You're so enthusiastic. I love it. OK. Why do boats love to celebrate Valentine's Day?  COMPAGNO: Bobbing in the water, yachting, sinking, swimming, pulling, starboard --  GUTFELD: Water, they sea, or they're on the sea.  PERINO: They're row-mantic. That's good, you guys. OK, why should you never marry a tennis player?  COMPAGNO: Falling back and forth?  WILLIAMS: Love.  PERINO: Because love means nothing to them. Very good, Juan. But Emily, I'm only doing corny jokes when you're here from now on.  GUTFELD: She's the only one that cares.  WILLIAMS: No, I like them. I like them. But you're good.  PERINO: Juan, go ahead.  WILLIAMS: All right, so it's Valentine's Day chocolate, so boring. Flowers, so ordinary. How about a Bud Light, folks? Yes, that's right. Take a look at this box. Show them the top lines. There you go. Bud Light is selling a red heart-shaped box that holds 12 cans of beer. On the top it says roses are red, Bud Light is blue.  On Instagram, the company said the perfect Valentine's Day gift doesn't exist. But 12 cans of beer is pretty good. The box has been a hit. The heart-shaped box sold out. So roses are red, violets are blue, throw me a beer, and baby you can grab one too.  PERINO: This is like something like on Christmas when you buy yourself a gift. This is what guys are bringing home tonight. Like hey, look what I got for us. Yes.  COMPAGNO: That is amazing.  PERINO: All right, Greg.  GUTFELD: Drunks need love. Tell me that. All right, the ""GREG GUTFELD SHOW,"" 10:00 tomorrow night. Mark Steyn, Rob O'Neill, Lat Timpf, Tyrus. I got my finger caught in the -- in the hinge of my glasses. All right, watch the show tomorrow. It's our cat-off. OK, you guys know the rules of the cat-off. I show three cat videos, we vote.  First cat is in a straw hat. It's a cat in the hat tradition. Look at that cat in a straw hat. I think the second one is also wearing a hat, but I didn't have much time kids. You got to move it up. There you go. This cat is wearing a tiger hat, a tiger hat. Oh, and you know, we're running out of time. Lawrence, look at this cat. Dana, I don't know what to say. Which one? You guys, quick vote.'  JONES: Two.  PERINO: Three.  COMPAGNO: Three.  GUTFELD: Number Three. There you go.  PERINO: Number three wins.  WILLIAMS: Wait, wait. What about the cat -- what happened to the cat in the hat, the first one?  PERINO: I think he's pretty cute. He didn't win though.  GUTFELD: All right.  PERINO: All right, Lawrence.  GUTFELD: Try to speed it up.  JONES: Not all heroes wear capes, some use shopping carts. Check out this surveillance footage in Peach --  GUTFELD: Amazing.  JONES: In Peachtree City, Georgia. Here's a guy with -- at a Walmart parking lot. And as the shoplifter is trying to get away. Look at him.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: Oh my gosh.  JONES: So according to the cops, no one -- the guy was arrested, all right, and no one -- they arrested him without incident.  PERINO: Did he get an award?  JONES: No. No award for this guy. He should get an award.  PERINO: That was pretty good.  GUTFELD: They carted him away.  PERINO: Greg's corny jokes. All right, Emily.  COMPAGNO: All right, you guys. So in honor of Valentine's Day, and some of you who might be hot tubbing tonight, check out this guy who decided to hot tub in a Wendy's you guys. This was this guy in Michigan, a Wendy's employee in it. He says it feels like a hot tub. And then he goes I'm just enjoying life while everyone else laughs in the background. Obviously, he gets terminated.  PERINO: Did he get fired?  COMPAGNO: Yes, 100 percent.  GUTFELD: He was terminated?  COMPAGNO: Yes.  WILLIAMS: Wait, why is there -- why is there a hot tub in the Wendy's?  COMPAGNO: No, in the sink. He was in the sink with the dishes.  WILLIAMS: In the sink?  COMPAGNO: Yes, yes, yes. That is -  PERINO: There's not a hot tub in Wendy's, Juan. All right, oh my God. That's it for us. Have a great weekend everybody.  Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC.

79,FOX,"Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg admits to paying people to post satirical memes on social media. Michael Bloomberg has admitted to paying people called “influencers"" to post satirical images known as “memes” on Instagram. What are influencers? They’re what we used to call nobodies. But now they’re nobodies with a footprint on social media who persuade the clueless into thinking people listen to them. That's easier to explain than trying to explain to Bloomberg what ""satire"" is. TRUMP WARS WITH BLOOMBERG: RIVALS GO FULL NEW YORKER WITH EPIC BOUT OF INSULTS But it’s true. Even people who fashion themselves as trendy hipsters will take cash from a billionaire. Who wouldn’t? That’s one of the least reported stories of this campaign. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Seriously, how good has Trump been for the political economy? He’s actually forced his new nemesis, “Mini Mike,” to pay millions for posh events, perks and pricey staffers. Good for him. That’s capitalism! ""You’re welcome,"" says Adam Smith. Still, it's odd to see Bloomer shoveling his fortune in the direction of an oncoming orange tornado. Only four years ago, Trump won everything by spending almost nothing. Instead, he got MSNBC's Morning Joe and CNN CEO Jeff Zucker to do the heavy lifting. They have the hernia scars to prove it. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Thanks to Bloomer, and Donald, too, some consultant who came up with a dumb idea to pay dolts on Instagram to say stupid stuff probably just got a down payment on his 50-foot cabin cruiser. And it's all to beat the president. In Trump's economy, a rising tide raises all boats. It buys a few yachts, too. Adapted from Greg Gutfeld’s monologue on “The Five” on Feb. 13, 2020.

80,FOX,"Sanders scores victory, Buttigieg in close second. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., placed first in New Hampshire’s primary. Former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg placed second, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., placed third. Poor Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., came in fourth. After the polls closed, an MSNBC host pointed out that Warren was at a campaign event ""taking pictures with all who ask."" Another added, ""This isn't lonely to me. This is awesome."" It was a photo finish! Now she’s on her way to becoming a Walmart Santa. MSNBC was so supportive. They sounded like your buddy after you get dumped, saying, ""Don't worry, there's other fish in the sea."" TRUMP DOUBLES OBAMA'S 2012 VOTE TOTAL IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, SIGNALING FIRED UP BASE But she doesn't just take pictures. She'll take your last three bucks! Warren told MSNBC in an interview that a college student conveyed that she only had $6 in her bank account, and so she gave Warren $3. ""That's what we gotta do,"" Warren said. Typical Democrat, taking half your money without a thought. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Former Vice President Joe Biden came in fifth. Like the time I stained a table with a cheap varnish, it was a disappointing finish. Yes, that joke is as bad as his campaign. So what did we learn? Authenticity rules, even when you're authentically wrong about everything. Remember, Bernie chooses socialism over capitalism every day. However, polling shows Americans will never vote for a socialist, so Bernie may do more to reelect Trump than Trump. Speaking of Trump, look at his numbers. He won more votes in New Hampshire's primary than President Obama in 2012, President Bush in 2004, and even President Reagan in 1984. Calling that a win is like calling the coronavirus the sniffles. ""Trump is going to be tough to beat,"" MSNBC's Chris Matthews said. ""I'm a bit frustrated, and I'm not the answer to all questions ... I'm just not tonight,"" he added with a sniffle of his own. Somebody get him a therapy chicken. As for Joe, he said, “You can’t win a general election as a Democrat unless you have overwhelming support from black and brown voters."" What exactly does he mean? Well, it’s a knock against Mayor Pete, who the media claims has a ""black voter"" problem. I suppose if they were white conservative voters, the media would just say they're homophobes. Meanwhile, Trump may get the most black votes of any Republican in recent history. He's done well creating an economy that favors all citizens. So ponder this contrast. Democrats say to African-Americans, ""You're a victim of the past and we're going to get you damages."" But then they never do. Trump says, ""You're going to do great right now and I'm going to help you."" And then he does. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Which one sounds better to you? To be victor or victim? Democrats know the answer. No wonder Chris is miserable. Adapted from Greg Gutfeld’s monologue on “The Five” on Feb. 12, 2020. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY GREG GUTFELD"
81,FOX,"Media, Democrats minimize economic surge under Trump. How bad do Americans feel about life in America? If you listened to the media and their favorite Democratic candidates, you'd say ""bad, ugly bad.""  You'd expect to look out the window and see breadlines and food riots. That's what Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., calls a ""worker's paradise"" from the porch of one of his big houses. SOURCE OF BLOOMBERG STOP-AND-FRISK AUDIO BLASTS CNN FOR 'DISMISSING' STORY But once again, the picture they paint and the reality lived by the rest of us diverge dramatically. That's what happens when you invent despair. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Take Gallup's annual mood survey. It reports that as Americans say they're better off now than they were a year ago 74 percent predict they'll do even better next year! That's the most optimistic reading they've ever recorded. So why the great mood amidst the gloom and the doom? Well, perhaps we finally see the gloom-and-doomers for what they are: fabricators with a grudge against a country that built the colleges where they were brainwashed. So while they paint an apocalypse with their bitter brush, the economy surges with amazing job and labor participation numbers. And not just for some, but for all. Women, black, teens, even ""never Trumpers"" and Democrats. It's great watching Republicans deliver on promises that the left could never keep. But there's another reason for optimism as well. Amidst the tweets and taunts, people forget that Trump is a cheerleader-in-chief. For years, he has been telling us how amazing America is. And that optimism is contagious, so much so that it's reversing the negative charges of an anti-capitalist, anti-American press. Trump shows us that solutions need not always involve blood or treasure. But by simply adjusting one's outlook.

82,FOX,"Candidates battle it out for the primary; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" February 11, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: And you know, it's the largest stadium in the world. He's building it now. It's almost complete. And it's the largest in the world, and he's a friend of mine. He's a great gentleman. And I look forward to going to India, so we'll be going at the end of the month.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE)  TRUMP: They want to do something --  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Hi, everybody. THE FIVE is going to come up in just a few minutes. We're going to finish listening to the president first.  TRUMP: I don't want to say. But you would be surprised. You'd be surprised, but I don't want to say.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You could talk a little bit more about some of the recent departures from the White House (Inaudible).  TRUMP: No, I obviously wasn't happy with the job he did. First of all, he reported a false call. It wasn't what was said on the call. What was said in the call was totally appropriate. And I call it a perfect call. I always will call it a perfect call. And it wasn't one call. It was two calls. They were two perfect calls.  And there were no set up. There was no anything. And he reported it totally differently. And then they all went wild when I said that we have transcripts of the calls. And they turned out to be totally accurate transcripts. And if anybody felt there was any changes, we let them make it because it didn't matter.  So we had totally accurate transcripts. And it turned out that what he reported was very different. And also, when you look at Vindman's -- the person he reports to, said horrible things, avoided the chain of command, it leaked, and did a lot of bad things. And so we sent him on his way to a much different location.  And the military can handle him anyway they want. General Milley has him now. I congratulate General Milley. And he can have him. But -- and his brother, also. So we will find out -- we will find out. But he reported very inaccurate things. You understand that, John, when you look at his report and then when you look at what actually -- the exact words.  Fortunately, I had the words, because otherwise, we would've had a lot of people lying. And we were able to do it. So fortunately, we had transcripts of those calls. I think you guys will agree with that, right? Wasn't it nice after they said these horrible things and made up these horrible, horrible, lies about what was said on the call?  And I then said here's the call and the transcript. If I didn't have a transcript, it would've been my word against their word. But there were other people on that call, too. Many people were on that call, Mike Pompeo. And I know that. When I speak to the head of state, of countries, presidents, prime ministers, etcetera.  There are always a lot of people on those calls, especially from the other countries, I imagine. I don't know that for a fact. But I know for a fact that we have a lot of people on those calls. Who would say something wrong? I wouldn't say it wrong anyway. But who would say wrong when you have -- when a call is loaded up with -- you know, sometimes as many as 25 people, sometimes as many as 3 or 4 or 2.  But there's always people on those calls. I fully know that. But that was a perfect call and it wasn't reported, though it was reported like, oh, it was so terrible. That was a very nice call. That was a very friendly call. Couple of things, the president, as you know, of Ukraine stated very strongly that there was no pressure.  There was no anything. There was nothing wrong. And it was really a very sad state of affairs that our country wasted that much time on nothing, on nothing. And I want to thank our three senators that are here for agreeing with me. I mean, you had one grandstander. He's always been a grandstander.  (OFF-MIKE)  TRUMP: Oh, sure. Oh, sure, absolutely. They always are.  (OFF-MIKE)  TRUMP: That is up to them. He is over with the military.  (OFF-MIKE)  TRUMP: That's going to be up to the military. We'll have to see. But if you look at what happened, I mean, they are certainly -- I would imagine take a look at that. But no, I think what he did was just reported a false call. If you look at what he said, and then I will tell you. One worse was you looked at Shifty Schiff. Take a look at what he did.  He made up my conversation. And then we dropped the transcript. And he almost had a heart attack. Didn't he say eight quid pro quos? Think of it. So eight times I said the same thing, according to Shifty Schiff. If I ever did that -- so you say it once. Now you say it again. We are talking about a man that I never even met before.  Now you say it a third time, a fourth time, a fifth time, six times, seven times, eight times, eight times. He said that I asked for the exact same thing in one call. After the third time, they would have to take you away, OK? He is a sick person. Schiff is a very corrupt politician and he's a sick person. So he made up -- totally made up, and because he shielded, which a lot of people didn't know.  But because he is shielded by the halls of Congress, you know, in terms -- he can say anything you he want. He made up of a story that was total fiction. And then at the end, he said don't call me. I will call you. That is a mob statement, very famous statement in numerous movies, one in particular. That is a mob statement.  Don't call me. I'll call you. He said that I said that. He said that I said eight times quid pro quo. Well, there were no times quid pro quo, nothing. And that whole thing was corrupt and a disgrace. And Romney is a disgrace for voting against. He is a disgrace, OK, anybody else?  (CROSSTALK)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Inaudible) do you support that policy and is it, as you said --  (CROSSTALK)  TRUMP: -- we can do to get down crime and get rid of drugs. But I think when a man is with -- stopped and frisked his whole life, and then decides to go Democrat, and he goes to a church, and he is practically crying. It looked like hell. He is practically crying, saying what a horrible thing he did. I think it is so disingenuous.  You know what I'm talking about, fellows. That was so -- of Bloomberg. Look, he is a lightweight. He is a lightweight. You're going to find that out. He's also one of the worst debaters I've ever seen. And his presence is zero. So he will spend his three, four, $500 million. Maybe they will take it away. Frankly, I would rather run against Bloomberg that Bernie Sanders.  Because Sanders has real followers, whether you like him or not, whether you agree with him or not. I happen to think it is terrible what he says. But he has followers. Bloomberg is just buying his way in. But we're going to find out what happens. We're going to find out. But when you watch -- go back to the church where he apologized for everything he ever did, practically.  And he looked pathetic. Our country doesn't need that kind of leadership. Thank you all very much.  (CROSSTALK)  TRUMP: It is doubling. It is mumbling, not pretty. But we will see how he does. You never know. You never know. The only time you knew for sure was the Trump campaign. Trump was going to win.  (OFF-MIKE)  TRUMP: He can always turn it around. I think it's not going to be easy. I think he can turn it around. I think he has a shot. He's got probably almost as good a shot as anyone. But he is going to have to work. He is going to have to work very hard, much harder than they thought. Don't forget. When he first ran, I called him one percent Joe.  Because every time he ran, he only got one percent. And then Obama took him off the garbage heap. But he only got one percent, right, John? You know that. One percent Joe, but now he is what, 19 percent Joe? It's better. He is doing better. He's made a lot of progress. But it's going to be very interesting. I think we're going to have a very interesting Democrat race.  And I think we're going to have a very interesting election. But our country is doing better than it has ever done. We've rebuilt our military. Thanks to the people back here. We've taken care of our vets at a level that they have never been taken care of before. And it is really something that we are very proud of. You look at the economy.  I mean, we have the best economy we have ever had. We have the best employment numbers we have ever had, African-American, Asian-American, Hispanic-American. We are going to protect our Second Amendment. The Democrats want to take away the guns. They want to take away everyone's gun. They want to destroy the Second Amendment. So when you add it all up, you know, I don't see how we lose. But you never know. It is politics, right, fellows? Thank you all very much.  (CROSSTALK)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you very much.  PERINO: All right. That was President Trump talking about a variety of topics, mocking the 2020 Democrats as well before the polls close here in New Hampshire. Welcome to THE FIVE. The next big chapter in the battle for 2020 is right here in the granite state. It's primary day for the Democrats, and yet another high stake contest in the race to the nomination.  So you just heard from President Trump going after his 2020 rivals. Well, they took aim at him in their final pitch to voters.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  BERNIE SANDERS (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We are going to defeat the most dangerous president in the modern history of America, Donald Trump.  JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I will be damned if I'm going to stand by and lose this country to Donald Trump four more years.  PETE BUTTIGIEG (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is our shot, our only shot to defeat Donald Trump.  ELIZABETH WARREN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He is the enemy, right? He is the guy who is out there undercutting every Democratic value.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: But the president is not one to rest on his laurels. And in fact, he decided to come to New Hampshire. He was here last night for a huge rally. Take a look. We don't have it? OK, I thought we had it. Because it was so good, I wanted to have it. Jesse Watters, Greg Gutfeld, Katie Pavlich, Juan Williams are all here with me. Am I right? Do we have them?  (CROSSTALK)  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: How are you doing?  PERINO: I could not see you. And I missed you so much.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: I'm wired up. I'm going to be so awake today. So one of the reasons I wanted to show that, Jesse, is because when President Trump came here last night, he's basically in the hunt for four Electoral College votes. He just missed it in 2016 by .4 percent. Last night, they had lots of voters come that had supported him.  And then they had an additional 17 percent of people that were here last night who were voters who did not vote in 2016. And half of those were here in New Hampshire. So the Trump campaign is doing pretty good.  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Yeah. They're not going to take this for granted. And what stains the momentum are these rallies where they can identify people. I think 20 percent were Democrats, 20 percent never even voted in the last election. So they have a real army that they are identifying and now just not activating the base, but reaching out to new voters, minority voters.  Now, his approval rating from non-white voters is up to 28 percent, a 10- point jump in just the year alone. So the man has been very blessed with great enemies, though, because none of these Democrats running for president has any sort of breakaway speed. Even if any of them starts getting any kind of lead, they're not going to be able to pull away or put anybody else away.  And here's why. It is not a winner-take-all situation, number one. And number two, if Bernie starts winning, then the never-Bernie forces are going to fight the guy to the death until the convention. But if a non- Bernie guy starts getting in there, Bernie's not going to let it go. He's going to fight to the death to the convention.  So you're going to have a very badly broke, damaged ticket. It's going to limp out of there, and Trump's just going to shred them. And his strategy is very simple. This is a Trump blue-collar boom. And these losers, socialist, weak, phoney Democrats, they are going to make us go broke and maybe kill us, or both.  PERINO: Wow, kill us even. OK, Greg, I want to show you a little bit of that Trump rally. We have that sound now. Take a look.  GUTFELD: Yey.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: With your help on November 3rd, we are going to defeat the radical socialist Democrats. We are going to win New Hampshire in a landslide. This is a truly incredible time for America. They always talk about the Democrats. They have enthusiasm, right? We have so much more enthusiasm. It is not even close. And people are signing up left and right.  But if you want to vote for a weak candidate tomorrow, go ahead. Pick one. Pick the weakest one.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: That is a good strategy, right? Pick the weakest Democrat.  GUTFELD: Yeah. You know, I think a lot of times the media doesn't understand these rallies. They are less political than they are fun. Like, I know people that go to these things. And it really is like Woodstock for woodworkers or Lollapalooza for longshoremen. It's actually people get there. They have a good time. The never-Trump filter never seems to understand this, which is why they misdiagnose so many issues.  And it's also why Trump is able to steal the spotlight from the Democrats, because you see life at the rallies. You don't see life among the Democrats. I mean, there is more life at Blockbuster video store than on the stage of Democrats. And that leads me to my comment about tonight in New Hampshire. I think we are seeing the end of this electability myth that we keep hearing about.  The most electable person, you know, whether it was Marco Rubio or Jeb or Hilary or Biden. Electability is like that hype you hear before a movie and then the movie turns out to be Cats. And it's, like, Joe Biden right now, he is Cats. And once the movie goes away, everybody stops talking about it. Meanwhile, when you're looking at Trump, it's like you are seeing a fantastic fun bar like Cheers.  And you look over the Democrats and it's a bar that hasn't been built yet because nobody can get along and figure out how to build it.  PERINO: They're drinking milk in there.  GUTFELD: Yes.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: Juan, I want you to take a look at -- we have a call from the media talking about Democrats and how people in that party are a little worried. Take a look at that.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have all talked to the voters. They are very concerned with the current field right now.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They are beginning to have that feeling of a loser. Joe Biden is almost on fumes really.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There is this kind of real unmistakable sense of fear among Democrats, particularly coming off of last week, fear of the president of being re-elected.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: How do they shake that off, Juan?  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Well, I think one thing is when you have a nominee, I think a lot of that's going to go away. It will be one-on-one. And I think it's pretty clear. Democrats, they know their number one priority is beating Donald Trump. But just to get back to what Greg was talking about, I could not agree more.  I think that this is like, you know, Wrestlemania or the -- you know, your favorite rock group comes to town. Lots of people turn out just to have the experience because it is fun. So I think lots of people do that. I think Trump you over read in it. And then Trump, of course, I think he uses these to troll not only the Democrats but he trolls the media.  You know, distract, mock, belittle, and everybody buys into it because you have got to cover at the president. He has the bully pulpit. But let me just remind you that right now, according to the Wall Street Journal, NBC, according to Quinnipiac, Biden is plus seven. For all we talk about Biden in trouble, he is plus seven over Trump, right now head-to-head. Sanders is plus eight, Warren plus four, Bloomberg plus nine.  These are numbers coming from reputable places. And I think today when you have two federal prosecutors quitting because the president decides to put pressure on the Justice Department, and then they put pressure about sentencing on career prosecutors. I think America looks at this and says you know, something is crazy going on right now in our country.  PERINO: Katie, we're going to get to Greg's monologue in just a minute. But let me give you a chance to talk about whatever you want to talk about here on the media side of things. I do think that there is a sense, it feels like, when the media starts saying that your candidacy is in trouble, it starts to become a self-fulfilling prophecy.  KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Yeah, which is why we saw Joe Biden kind of skip town today from New Hampshire, leave his supporters just like Hillary Clinton did when she did not show up for her election night, non- victory party. But Juan, 52 percent are -- in swing districts that President Trump needs to win to win again. He has a 52 percent approval rating.  So you can say that Biden is up on him nationally by those percentages. But what really counts and where the voting matters, President Trump is winning on the issues that Democrats are having a hard time taking back. But on the electability thing, that is certainly is something that is always overblown by the media's favorite candidate.  And if you notice, every single Democrat has campaigned not necessarily against each other, but against President Trump, and making the case that they are electable. Bernie Sanders is one of them. There was an op-ed that was published that was very critical of Joe Biden on behalf of a Bernie surrogate. Bernie came out and said I'm sorry that an op-ed was published.  And so they're all making the case that they are electable. They are not allowing the narrative to drive how they think this thing should end up.  PERINO: Indeed. All right, Greg.  GUTFELD: All right. Can I do my monologue?  PERINO: Yes, please.  GUTFELD: All right. I know. Try to control yourselves, people. I know. All right, how bad do Americans feel about life in America? If you listen to the media and their favorite Democratic candidates, you would say bad, ugly bad. You would expect to look out the window and see bread lines and food riots, what Bernie calls a worker's paradise from the porch of one of his big houses.  But once again, the picture they paint and the reality lived by the rest of us diverge dramatically. That is what happens when you invent despair. Take Gallup's annual mood survey. It reports that as Americans say they are better off now than a year ago, 74 percent predict they will do even better next year. That's the most optimistic reading they have ever recorded.  So why the great mood amidst the gloom and the doom? Well, perhaps finally we see the gloom and doomers for what they are, fabricators with a grudge against a country that built the colleges where they were brainwashed. So while they paint an apocalypse with their bitter brush, the economy surges with amazing job and labor participation numbers.  And not just for some, but for all, women, blacks, teens, even never- Trumpers, and Democrats, it is great watching Republicans deliver on promises that the left can never keep. But there's also another reason for the optimism amidst the tweets and the taunts. People forget that Trump is a cheerleader-in-chief. For years, he has been telling us how amazing America is.  And that optimism is contagious. So much so, it's reversing the negative charges of an anti-capitalist, anti-American press. Trump shows us that solutions need not always involve blood or treasure, but by simply adjusting one's outlook. It turns out the power of positive thinking actually works. I will start tomorrow if there is one. So why do you think, Katie, optimism is so high when everybody is saying otherwise?  PAVLICH: I don't think that everybody is saying otherwise. I think that Democrats running against President Trump have to have a victim mentality when it comes to the argument that they are making. And people in America who are making more money have -- more job opportunities are saying I'm not a victim. I am reaping the -- I have success.  I'm reaping the rewards of my hard work and perseverance. I started a new business. I'm able to work in the gig economy. So I think Democrats thrive on a message of victim-hood all of the time. And it really only works when the economy is down and people feel like they need some benefit from the government to really succeed. That doesn't really fly here.  Democrats, I think, are portrayed as weak because that is the only thing they have to go on. But the reality of everybody's situation, whether it's their happiness or their job employment, it doesn't really add up.  GUTFELD: Dana, I have a theory that Americans in general see the glass always as half-full, but the left see the glass as racist. So it is like nothing can be done with that glass or that country, because fundamentally it is polluted.  PERINO: Yeah. So when I -- I lived in England. I know you lived there, too. I don't know if you experienced the same thing. I used to say to Peter Americans are glass half-full kind of people. And it felt like the Brits were kind of glass half empty. If you asked them how it's going. Oh, not so bad. If you ask an American how's it going? Oh, I am good.  Like, it is just a different outlook. I do think that it's interesting. President Trump's inauguration speech was very much doom and gloom, if you remember that. But then he skilfully figured out a way to say OK. I'm going to let the free market work. He hasn't micromanaged his cabinet. The media is so focused on the president himself that they don't have any idea what is going on in any other agency.  So all the deregulation is happening on a quick pace and the free market is actually been able to produce these results. I don't know if they will be able to figure out a way to communicate that to these young people that think that socialism is a better way to go. But that might be a good challenge for them to try to tackle in his second term.  GUTFELD: We have had a lot of good news, Jesse.  WATTERS: Yes, we have. What are you talking about specifically?  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: My new haircut?  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: I would say this. I think socialism is for people who are lazy, jealous, and don't understand how the world works. The world works through competition. Whenever you have socialism pop up, it fails because people don't compete. I read the Green New Deal. They guarantee free college, free housing, free healthcare, free income. They raise taxes by trillions of dollars.  What is that going to do to the workforce? People are going to stop working and they're going to stop competing and then America dies. Is that what socialism wants to do, destroy America? Or is it just a sales pitch by radical Democrats to get in power on the backs of people who are uninformed and lazy and jealous? How are you going to have free healthcare if you couldn't even get Obamacare off the ground?  How are you going to have free housing when you can't even put the homeless in homes? How are you going to have free college if I am supposed to pay my neighbors dumb sons tuition? I mean, the guy is going to fail out after the first semester. And why am I paying for someone's free income and then paying for their free college?  I am supposed to pay for the job they are not going to get? It doesn't make any sense. But the thing that makes the most sense is that Bernie Sanders is leading this charge. The guy has never done anything his whole political career, yet we paid his salary. So literally, we have paid Bernie to do nothing.  GUTFELD: Juan, care to respond?  WILLIAMS: Well, you know, I mean, so you don't educate people. What are you going to do? Pay for them to be in jail? Pay for them on unemployment? Listen, let's get real here. You know, you guys are making the case that everything is great, re-elect Trump. And I will agree. I think the unemployment rate is low. Labor participation rate is high.  But here's other side of the coin, in case you missed it. Household debt has been surging. It's the highest right now that it has been since before the great recession going back to 08, 09. Suicide rates, a real indication how people are doing now, the highest since World War II, the deficit is over $1 trillion. Remember when Republicans said we have to be responsible?  This is going to impact future generations. And in fact, when you think about household debt, don't forget. Half of Americans said if they had a $400 bill, not only would they have to go either to friends, neighbors, or credit cards, some say they just could not pay it. That is the reality. Think about healthcare, 34 million Americans.  The 34 million Americans, that's in 1 of 6 Americans, by 15 percent say they know someone who has not been able to pay a medical bill, not able to pay for prescription drugs. And that's why they died. So when you talk about that from the Democrats' perspective, not just Trump's spin everything is great, re-elect me.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: It's not spin. It was -- a Gallup poll of Americans saying they felt good.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: I'm just telling you --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: And they say oh, this is -- he tells people everything is great. Everything is great. And if you are not great, you're not in the club.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: We want you in the club, Juan. Juan, we want you in the club, half glass full.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: You said everything is racist if you say, hey, you know what, America? I believe in America. And America, we can do a better job of taking care of our children, and our elderly, and our sick. You say that means you're racist. Come on.  GUTFELD: I actually didn't say that. But we'll let that go. If you want to believe that you heard that --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: I think I heard it.  GUTFELD: Coming up, how bad will New Hampshire be for Joe Biden? He has already left the state. That's next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WATTERS: The polls closing in New Hampshire in about two and a half hours from now. And we have brand-new Fox News voter analysis. The most important issue there, healthcare, so we're going to keep an eye on that data as it comes in. Meantime, the implosion of the Biden campaign continues. Sensing a disaster tonight in New Hampshire, the former vice president is booking it out of the state and is headed to South Carolina. Here is Joe trying to downplay it.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  BIDEN: We will fight for every vote we have and then we're heading down to South Carolina. Having lost nine primaries and win only one, this is just the beginning. We have an entire nation to vote yet. I am not giving up on New Hampshire. Don't poke that in my face, OK, buddy?  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: And even though Biden's campaign is still on the ropes, he's talking about Trump.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  BIDEN: I refuse to suggest any Democrat can lose. I think, you know, we could run Mickey Mouse against this president and have a shot.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: And the president hitting back just a few minutes ago.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: It is doubling. It is mumbling. Not pretty, but we will see how he does. You never know. You never know. The only time you knew for sure was the Trump campaign. Trump was going to win. Don't forget. When he first ran, I called him one percent Joe, because every time he ran, he only got one percent. Now, he is what, 19 percent Joe? He's better. He's doing better. He's made a lot of progress.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: All right. Greg, well, Mickey Mouse couldn't beat Donald Trump. I mean, Hillary lost to Donald Trump. What is he saying about Hillary and Mickey?  GUTFELD: Well, he would know. He is Goofy. No, this is the perfect line for Trump supporters next rally. Could you imagine like everybody wearing a Mickey Mouse mask? Like having somebody print up those masks and having 20,000 people wearing masks?  Here's the deal. On the Friday's debate, Biden's performance was loud and defensive, very ornery, kind of like the way it was just then. And now that's among a group that contains people like Amy and Mayor Pete. He's already kind of in the red zone, straining his engine. You don't think he's going to blow a gasket up there with Trump?  And I mean, he's -- he is chummy. But the last thing you want when you're around a shark is a chum. He's going to be eaten alive and I think that -- I think it's -- I think it's getting -- he's an old -- he's an older man who projects weakness, and that's a reverse Trump who's not a nice guy, but he projects bottomless energy.  WATTERS: Dana, what does it say to you that he's leaving and going to South Carolina before the votes finished?  PERINO: I actually think strategically it's pretty smart because he knew that he wasn't going to necessarily get a win here. And so if he were to stay here tonight, imagine this, he goes to his watch party, and everyone sticks a microphone in his face and says, When are you going to drop out? When are you going to drop out? When are you going to drop out?  And instead of having to answer those, they have a readymade answer. It's like, I'm moving on to South Carolina, we got a long way to go. You already heard him to kind of say that. They got a long way to go. I did think that one of the worst messages -- messaging points from him today was in that clip you just showed about Mickey Mouse. Because this entire election, the reason he got in is he said that he is the only Democrat that could beat President Trump. And now he's saying that all of them could. That doesn't really mean that you should win.  WATTERS: Great points, Dana. Katie, what do you think?  PAVLICH: I completely agree with Dana. I also think that his ability to just leave New Hampshire behind creates ads for his fellow Democrats and for President Trump. You can say if he's bailing on New Hampshire voters and not giving them a chance to celebrate with him or not waiting for the votes to come in, why would he not bail or be reliable on anything else?  You know, strategically, his campaign has always banked on South Carolina. He knows that he has to go down there and defend what he sees as his territory. It's Michael Bloomberg, and even Bernie Sanders are catching up to him the demographics that he really needs. This has been his entire campaign narrative about where their campaign is going to begin and their path to victory in the Democratic primary, so I can see why he would go down there.  Their argument essentially is this is -- New Hampshire is a battle and the long process of the primary war and they're confident that they can go down and defend their territory.  WATTERS: Juan, how bad is it on the Biden campaign? Are we making too much of this?  WILLIAMS: I think you are, because just to quote President Trump from what we saw earlier tonight. He says, oh, yes, he can come back. You can see that. I think I can see it too, because the long-term strategy is always been South Carolina and Nevada.  The problem here is that I think that Bernie Sanders going to do very well tonight, according to every poll, all indications, all I've seen on the ground here visiting some of the rallies. Bernie Sanders was the one with energy. And not only that, I think Bernie Sanders has the potential now to run the table. I mean, I think he's picking up speed in South Carolina and not -- I don't think he's going to win there, but I think he's picking up speed, noticeably in Nevada, especially with Latino voters.  And again, I think a lot of people have overlooked Bernie. I don't know how you can do it at this point. He really has a lot of momentum, not only from Iowa, but now, you know, here. And my sense is that you got to also think about Bloomberg as a factor. I think we're going to discuss that shortly. But it is -- at this moment, what you're looking at is the battle for that middle lane to go against Bernie Sanders who has taken control of the most energetic -- not the majority, but the most energetic sector of the Democratic base, the left-wing.  WATTERS: All right, well, as you mentioned, Bloomberg, he's doing some damage control after being called a racist over this old clip where he defends stop and frisk. We'll show that to you next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PAVLICH: Michael Bloomberg in major trouble after an audio clip from 2015 resurface where he is defending stop and frisk.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  MICHAEL BLOOMBERG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: 95 percent of your murders - - murderers and murder victims fit one M.O. You can just take a description, Xerox it, and pass it out to all the cops. They are male, minorities. That's true in virtually every city. People say, oh, my God, you are arresting kids for marijuana that are all minorities. Yes, that's true. Why? Because we put all the cops in minority neighborhoods because that's where all the crime is.  (END VIDEO CLIP)'  PAVLICH: Now, Bloomberg campaign putting out a statement saying he inherited the policy and has already apologized for it. Here's President Trump's reaction.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think when a man is with stop and frisk his whole life, and then he decides to go Democrat, and he goes to a church, and he's practically crying and look like hell, he's practically crying, saying how -- what a horrible thing he did. I think that's so disingenuous. You know what I'm talking about, fellows. It was so Bloomberg. Look, he's a lightweight. He's a lightweight. You're going to find that out.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PAVLICH: And so Greg, President Trump has also been a supporter of stop and frisk. He's probably talked to police departments about the -- or police union organizations about that. Is Bloomberg canceled now as a result of his statements?  GUTFELD: I don't think so. I will criticize him, but I'll also defend him. One, that was a bad way to put it about the Xeroxing, and it was inelegant, to put it mildly. But what's missing in this story is what was the reality like before this was instituted? Were there meetings, borough meetings where minority citizens and family members pled for help in their -- in a neighborhood that was plagued by crime?  They wanted their kids to go out -- be able to go out and play. They wanted to walk home from the supermarket. So the cruel irony here, for people who are just trying to make a minority neighborhood safer is that the methods you use to help save these minority neighborhoods can be recast as specifically targeting minorities simply because it's in that community, when actually what you're trying to do is save people's lives. But that could be now twisted in turned into, you are going after black kids.  PAVLICH: You know, Juan, a lot of this has been a reaction and a claim that African-Americans have think monolithically about the issue of crime and the police. But the CDC says the number one cause of death for African- American men ages one to 44 is homicide by gunshot. So how do you kind of draw that distinction between trying to make these communities safer, but also not maybe phrasing it the way that Michael Bloomberg did?  WILLIAMS: Well, I think we're -- you know, I think Black people are citizens and they want to be safe and they want police protection in their neighborhoods, Katie, but it's not the case that you want to have your kid, your son, especially walk out the door, get in the car and realize they're going to be immediately harassed for being a black kid in America. I mean, that's where it really breaks down.  It's not a matter of providing protection. It's not an anti-police attitude. It's a matter of police, you know, as reflected in what Bloomberg said, basically saying, I see a young black person, you know, the stop and frisk thing, a lot of people still defend it, but it was only like one out of every 10 that were ever found with anything, one out of 10.  And so you're, you're antagonizing a whole community, not only the young men, but also their families with that kind of attitude. I will say that to me, when you have the president then send out a tweet that says Michael Bloomberg is a total racist and then have to delete it, once he realized all he was on the record is saying stop and frisk is a good thing, it tells you a lot about the hypocrisy on not only this crime policy, but on race in America.  PAVLICH: So Dana, President Trump also said that this was Michael Bloomberg pandering, that he's just simply changing his position because he changed his party. He's now running against him for President. So how did the politics of this play out?  PAVLICH: Well, I think that the only reason you saw this come out today is because Michael Bloomberg has been gaining momentum because he spent so much money on ads, and he's got this infrastructure built out all across the country. We've have never seen anything like this before with someone spending this kind of money.  And just yesterday, the Quinnipiac poll that came out that showed that his -- Michael Bloomberg's approval with African-Americans had risen significantly. So I'm not surprised that something like this came out and I think a lot more of it is to come. It will be interesting to see if -- when Michael Bloomberg says I should have -- I apologize, I take ownership of it, I'm sorry to see how that plays out. I don't -- I don't know exactly how that will be determined, but we might be able to see it when he gets on to the debate stage in Nevada.  PAVLICH: Jesse?  WATTERS: Well, when he steps up on his box at the podium at the debate stage, I think the Democrats are going to go for the jugular here, because he's been looming over Super Tuesday, banking on black voters turning out nationally. And this might make black voters look at Bloomberg and say, this is not the kind of guy that we want representing us.  It's one thing to say we send more police to areas where they get 911 calls. No one argues with that. That makes perfect sense. What he said and we didn't play it, was you throwing black kids up against the wall and frisking them. No one wants to hear young black kids getting thrown up against the wall. It's not right. It's illegal search and seizure.  And I agree with Juan. 80 percent of the time they frisk these people, nothing was found. No weapons, nothing. So these were innocent people and it just ended up hurting the relationship between police and the minority community.  PAVLICH: Certainly, we will continue to watch. But up ahead, it's big night for Democrats in New Hampshire. More in the primary coming up on THE FIVE.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WILLIAMS: Election Day in New Hampshire finally here. The polls close and just a few hours from now, our very own Bret Baier and Martha McCallum, they will be anchoring special live coverage tonight. Thanks for joining us, guys. We have this Fox News exit polls, voter analysis polls out -- the voter analysis polls, I should say. And the number one thing I noticed was healthcare. 35 percent of Democrats in New Hampshire say that's their top issue. Bret?  BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANCHOR: Well, I think that's right. And I think that you can characterize the Democratic race that they're really going to go after that issue and it's driving voters. I think, just anecdotally we're hearing the turnout could be high. Also, we're hearing more about the actions of the campaigns, how they think that this night may go.  The fact that Joe Biden is left for South Carolina kind of gives you a sense that he -- they don't feel his going to go well. And Elizabeth Warren turning to kind of a blunt attack, kind of gives you a sense that maybe she doesn't think it's going to go well.  MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANCHOR: Go ahead, Dana.  PERINO: Oh, if I just quick quickly ask you this. I noticed at the end, they asked -- how do you feel about the Trump administration on these Democratic voters in New Hampshire? Four percent said enthusiastic, 16 percent dissatisfied, and then 75 percent angry. And I wonder if you see that, like that's going to really drive 2020 is anger.  MACCALLUM: Yes, I mean, I think it's clear that a lot of these voters and a lot of people that we spoke to up here, the number one thing that they wanted to was to replace the president. If you look at the discussion of decency, and empathy, and issues like that on the campaign trail that seemed to be resonating with these voters. We'll see how they voted later tonight. But clearly, anger at the president and a desire to get him out of office seems to be dominant in everything that we've seen so far, Dana.  BAIER: And these two lanes are forming. And I think that they're pretty -- they're forming tonight and will continue to.  WILLIAMS: Jesse Watters.  WATTERS: Hey, guys, how satisfied do you think that voters in New Hampshire are with the candidates because looking at some of the Exit polls, you have if the candidates a female, if the candidates gay, if the candidate is very liberal or older, would that make it harder easier to defeat Donald Trump. In almost every poll, they say, it would make it harder. And that defines basically the field.  BAIER: You're right. I think that there is some questions. There are some questions about, about who is going to pull this out. There is clearly an undecided New Hampshire Democratic population. And then you add to the mix, obviously, Mike Bloomberg on Super Tuesday. So it's going to shake things up.  MACCALLUM: I mean, those are clearly numbers that make him very happy, no doubt, in his campaign. They've put a ton of money into this. I mean, there's just such an irony behind the potential that Mike Bloomberg could be somebody that these voters turned to.  And on the other hand, you see such strong support, at least in this state, and we'll see how it turns out tonight for Bernie Sanders. I mean, you can't get further apart than the billionaire and the guy who puts at the bottom of all of his mailings and everything, not from billionaires, you know, so it's pretty striking.  WILLIAMS: Gregory.  MACCALLUM: He says it better than I do.  GUTFELD: I would like to cede my time to Katie.  PAVLICH: Oh, thank you, Greg. OK, Brett, I have a question for both of you, but I'll put it to you first. So, coming out of Iowa without results still now going into the New Hampshire primary, these voter analysis says that 59 percent are confident that the process is fair, which leaves 41 percent thinking it is unfair. Looking way down the road, how is that going to play when the results start coming in and we're really in a tight race for delegates among the candidates?  BAIER: Well, I think there's a lot of skepticism among the Bernie Sanders folks. They just don't think that this process the last time was fair to them. They're worried about the process this time being fair to them. So we'll have to see. Tonight could be the time that Bernie Sanders steps up, takes a big W, and moves on.  MACCALLUM: Yes. And I think there's a real concern in the Democrat Party about treating those Bernie Sanders voters fairly and having them feel that the process is fair so that they don't just sit on their hands if this ends up going another way, and making sure that they feel like, you know, this time around it's the same thing didn't happen as last time around. That could lead us to a brokered convention. That is a possibility that I think is very real.  WILLIAMS: Yes. Bret and Martha, will be watching it tonight. Thanks so much for coming over to THE FIVE.  MACCALLUM: Thanks, you guys.  BAIER: Bye, guys.  MACCALLUM: Good to see you.  WILLIAMS: ""ONE MORE THING"" up next. Stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PERINO: It's time for one more thing. I'm going to go first. So we have footage of Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg out New Hampshire. They were battling. I couldn't believe it. Take a look at this. This is very -- Bernie Sanders going after Mayor Pete. Sanders pulls him of.  WATTERS: Wait, which one is Pete?  PERINO: Pete is in the blue, Bernie is in the pink. And they're really going after each other. This is how you're going to settle things here in New Hampshire.  GUTFELD: They are the greatest of all time.  WATTERS: It's like the caucus. It doesn't really matter.  PERINO: But like you got to put the pool noodles on your goats if they're going to fight safely. It's how they do it.  PAVLICH: Those look like guardrails. Those are nice.  PERINO: All right, Juan, your next.  WILLIAMS: All right, today, we have for you the fad of the moment. It's called the broomstick challenge. The idea is to have a broom stand straight up on its own defying gravity. This is all based on phony, totally false report that NASA said Monday the earth was position so to allow a broom to stand straight up on its own.  So take a look at Paula Abdul doing the challenge. And then we have Fox Business' great Lou Dobbs, one of Greg's favorites. And you know what, I had to try it myself. So take a look. Here I am. I'm telling you. Can we -- talking about fake news.  PERINO: All right, Jesse, you're next.  WATTERS: I'm going to have to try that. All right, we have a feeding frenzy, folks. So you know our good friend John Rich. Well, Redneck Riviera is rolling out some new products. So you guys ready for these meat strips. We got three flavors. We have whiskey Barbecue Steak, Amarillo Heat Season Pork, and Spicy Fried Pickled Pork Strips. I'm going to try one right now. It packs a big punch and go to food.redneckriviera.com to get yours.  PAVLICH: This is Greg's center.  PERINO: Wow. My mouth is watering all the way up here in New Hampshire even.  WATTERS: It's good. It's good.  PERINO: Greg, you're next.  GUTFELD: I think John should really start selling more products on THE FIVE. All right, do this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Animals are great. Animals are great. Animals are great.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: You know, if you're like me, you don't have any friends, sometimes you just got to play with yourself like this little fellow.  PAVLICH: What?  GUTFELD: Look at this. That's -- you know, this is my childhood lying on my side, playing with a ball, pushing the ball around. What a smart cat this is. I mean, to have figured this out is kind of pretty impressive that -- what are you going to do? What are you going to -- oh, it's going to come back around. No, it did. Anyway, that cat knows where it's at. You don't need friends, cat, when you have a ball.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Animals are great. Animals are great. Animals are great.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: Katie, bring us home.  PAVLICH: OK, so 18-month-old Kenley Britton was devastated when her special daddy doll went missing on a Delta flight. The doll featured a picture of her father in military uniform and played a recording of his voice when she pushed a button. So sweet. Kenley's mother took to Facebook writing that her daughter carries the doll everywhere with her because her father was deployed and she needed it to go to sleep.  Her story went viral and Delta found it, and good news, and tweeted we found your doll, Kenley. He missed you but don't worry, we're bringing him home. So another uplifting happy story about a little girl getting her dad's doll back while he's deployed.  PERINO: That's such a good idea.  WATTERS: Did you bring a little --  PERINO: I need one of those dolls of Greg to take around with me --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: That's actually life-sized.  PERINO: On the campaign trail.  WILLIAMS: Jesse, you know what, the food up here in New Hampshire, the clam chowder, delicious.  WATTERS: All right, I'll be there.  PERINO: All right, set your DVRs.

83,FOX,"Democrats, media rage over current state of party; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" February 10, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST: Hello, everybody. I'm Jesse Watters, along with Katie Pavlich, Juan Williams, Dana Perino, and Greg Gutfeld. It is 5:00 in New York City and New Hampshire, and this is ""The Five."" President Trump looking to shake up the Democrats ahead of their big primary in New Hampshire. Trump getting ready to hold a rally in Manchester tonight before the 2020 contenders face off in the state tomorrow. Trump supporter's lining up for hours to see the president, while Democrats are in a state of total dysfunction. They are still fighting over the results in Iowa. And now, they are going after each other. Check out this back and forth between sinking Sleepy Joe and Mayor Pete. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He is a good guy. He is a great mayor. But guess what? He was a mayor. He is a good guy. But the idea of passing a budget as mayor of a town the size of Manchester and managing 900 billion, you think -- this guy is not a Barack Obama. PETE BUTTIGIEG (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, he is right. I am not. And neither is he. Neither is any of us. And this is not 2008. This is 2020. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Wow. And while candidates continue to tear each other apart, top liberals are warning that the field doesn't have what it takes to beat Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The problem here is the Democratic Party. The idea of a political party is to win elections. That's all it is about. If you don't do that, you have done nothing. It's not to make a point. It's not to start a revolution. It is to win the election. I have the idea of the Democratic Party that I read about and I see on television. And that is a bunch of people on Twitter running around causing trouble. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The other depressing thing about this week was, you know, at his best moment, the Democrats are -- they just look like the gang who can't shoot straight or can't run straight. And if they can't get their act together soon, it's going to be over before it begins. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Wow. Greg, it looks like despair has set in on the Democratic Party. And you know what? You can't argue with them. Carville and Maher are right. I can't believe I just said that. GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Well, you know, the thing is you notice there's a strong sense of sadness in Bill Maher's voice. And I could feel bad for that. I could feel bad for the -- all the smart cool kids like him and Sam Harris. But these people were warned, right? Every day for months on this show, we were saying you are going to be in for a huge let down if you don't start thinking about the future and stop putting all your eggs in the impeachment basket. Unless you divorce yourself from that emotional fantasy, you're going to end up -- it is like a worse hangover than tequila. Tequila doesn't cause you -- (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: There is nothing worse than tequila. GUTFELD: -- months of therapy. DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: I can't drink it. GUTFELD: Yeah. I got to tell you. The only reason why they are sad is they keep -- their filter is broken, right? Why do so many smart people, and Bill Maher is smart, and Sam Harris is smart. They keep stepping on the same rake and it's the same rake we keep saying don't step on it. So you step on it with obstruction. You step on it with collusion. You step on it with Kavanaugh. You step on it with -- and we keep saying, you have got to change your filter. The big point that I find that -- I think the fact that you are sad is a selfish commentary because the country is doing really great. WATTERS: Oh, that is a good point. GUTFELD: You're really, really great. But I feel sad. And it's, like, almost like your sadness, your emotional pain caused by Trump's personality is more valuable than a stronger, safer country. And I would much rather -- I would much rather be happier with a less competent, more warlike president because, you know, that makes me feel good. So there is an underlying selfishness behind these intellectuals that makes me want to laugh and watch them drown in their tears. And that is a joke. Drown in their tears. WATTERS: Juan, Greg's analogy, how does the rake taste? We warned you. JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: I don't know why -- (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: I think you guys must know the taste of that dirt in the rake's teeth, because gee, I think half the country still wants this guy out of here. And I'm sitting in a state -- (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: -- in New Hampshire. I'm just sitting in the state of New Hampshire where I saw today was, like, plus 60 percent of the Democrats in the state say they would rather have the state hit by a meteor then see Trump re-elected. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: Isn't that an emotional point? WILLIAMS: Oh, wait a second. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: Oh, I see. Look, I think you guys -- I am so curious to see how you react to all of this. Because, in fact, the reality is that the nominating process is always a messy process, and it is always like a roller coaster. And sometimes the roller coaster goes off the tracks. And sometimes you think Jeb Bush is going to be the nominee and then it is Donald Trump. And then Trump is on tape saying awful things about grabbing women. And you think it is gone again. And look how it worked out for the Republicans. You got a Republican president. So we don't know where this is going. But once there is a nominee, I think the dynamic shifts. And you stop talking about that dysfunction. You start talking about Democrats coalescing behind a candidate. And at that point, then you start to see why Trump has never, never hit -- (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: I would agree with you, Juan, in a normal cycle. But I don't see the Democrats, Dana, coalescing behind anybody in this field who they nominate. Have you gone to a few diners and heard a similar opinion? PERINO: Well, I would tell you that the mood here definitely feels like -- there is some excitement, especially the Bernie Sanders rallies. Like, those people are in love. They follow him. They believe in him. He doesn't talk down to them. It is not condescending. He has always been who he is. Do I see the entire Democratic Party getting behind him to try to oust Donald Trump? I have to tell you today I find that very hard to imagine. But, you know, if he became the nominee, maybe we would see something different. The other dynamic that is happening here is that President Trump is coming tonight. He's going to have his rally here in Manchester. And the beat was the sight of his last rally before the election here in the primary in New Hampshire, where he ran away with it. And I think he has a special affinity for New Hampshire, because that was kind of the first contest that said, OK, he could actually win this thing. He could be on to the White House. And so he will be coming back tonight. And it will be packed. People have been staying up overnight. There are people coming from different states in order to be here. So the -- he -- whatever he has done here, he has locked in his support. And I think that anyone who was independent in 2016 that voted per President Trump has probably switched their registration to Republican to vote for him this time. And he only lost this state by .4 percent in 2016. And I think that they think that they will be able to win that in 2020. I didn't say I think they think -- they think they can. I think they will. WATTERS: Yeah, I think they will, too. Katie, do you agree? KATIE PAVLICH, GUEST CO-HOST: I think that President Trump may win New Hampshire. But going back to the chaos in the Democratic Party, I want to say that I agree with Juan in the sense that we do have a very long way to go here. But when it comes to momentum, momentum doesn't just apply to individual candidates. It applies to the party as a whole. When you have the Iowa caucus vote still being in disarray, they still can't figure out whether all the data and information was in the voting system. There is now this cloud over the entire primary process from the beginning about whether the person who may end up winning actually won it fairly. And that is certainly something that the Bernie camp will be thinking about when they go into this if he doesn't get the nomination. And whether they are going to then support the nominee against President Trump, but that Trump campaign has been on the ground all over the place, not just in New Hampshire, Vice president Mike Pence has been in New Hampshire today with Ivanka Trump at diners, meeting and shaking hands. And Democrats have had a very hard time catching up, not just on the ground but on issues. And they are running out of things to run against the president on. In New Hampshire, he ran on dealing with the opioid crisis and he has delivered on that. And I completely with Dana that people will see that issue. See what he has done and decide to change their registration and vote for him. WATTERS: Greg, when was the last time you were at a diner? GUTFELD: I actually frequent many diners. Are there other places beside diners? Aren't there restaurants? WATTERS: No, just diners. GUTFELD: Just diners? WATTERS: Just diners all over New Hampshire. GUTFELD: I think we need more man on the street interviews, Jesse. Go out there and see -- (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: Wait, wait, wait, Jesse, Jesse. Chris Wallace and I and Chris's wife went to the Red Arrow Diner today. And they have plaques on the chairs where Al Gore, Obama, even Mayor Pete sat. PERINO: What about you? (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: You have to get up here. I am saying we need a plaque for Jesse Watters right in the snow. You might have to wait in line outside until I let you in. WATTERS: All right. I will check the temperature and I'll be right up. All right, next up, all but one 2020 Democrat fully embracing the party's socialist push. We will show you that next. GUTFELD: Diners. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GUTFELD: You remember Friday night's Democratic debate? Yeah, me neither, the high point, this question. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is anyone else on the stage concerned about having a Democratic socialist at the top the Democratic ticket? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I am not. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Senator Klobuchar? (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: See that? Amy Klobuchar was the only one who raised her hand. We don't count Bernie, which says something good about her and something frightening about the rest. She thinks for herself as the rest cower before the fringe. The sad thing about this crop, you're grateful for even a grain of common sense. Apparently voicing disgust of an ideological menace that helped kill millions is now an act of blasphemy, anyway, what a mess. Mayor Pete is a thesaurus without specifics. Liz Warren is an evasive phoney. Joe sounded like the guy at the bar after he got fired, talking loudly about all the stuff that he did better than everyone else. It's also kind of bad when Dems say they would not kill a terrorist. Who are they worried about passing off, other terrorists? Oddly, they seem more spiteful of companies which are just people. But lacking economic skills, Democrats think companies are sinister engines run by the Monopoly Guy in a top hat. They plead for unanimously while slamming folks who were once examples of American opportunity as the economy rolls on with more jobs, wages, and satisfaction. They accuse half the country of exploiting the other half. So now, a reasonable Democrat becomes the fringe as others parrot the line that America is racist through and through, which leads to divisive factions and punitive actions. They deny real progress with race which puts future progress in jeopardy. How do you measure change when you reject its existence? Amy is at least rooted in some reality, which means she is toast. You, Jesse, had an interesting perception about Amy. We both think that she might be the surprise. WATTERS: Yes. I think she will do well tomorrow. And she could beat Sleepy Joe. She is right at his heels right now. So, you know, she could really put the nail in the coffin for Joe. I think she is the only one that really shows like she wants it. I mean, you have to take this nomination. Barack Obama took it from Hillary. Trump took it from Jeb. They are serving up these questions about socialism on a silver platter. And everyone's just looking around at their shoes. These guys really have to want it. But I do get the sense that socialism now in the Democratic Party is too big to beat. They are not going to be able to put it in a corner anymore and pretend it doesn't exist and pay it lip service. They are going to have to make peace with Bernie with the socialist faction at the convention. Because there is a good chance he could wind up with the most delegates at that convention. And they only have themselves to blame with socialism. They have radicalized themselves on Twitter. They've abandoned the middle-class workers in this country. And a lot of the Democratic elites went hard in with the lobbyists, went hard in with Wall Street, and they just didn't deliver the goods for average working class American people. At this point, if you have Bernie, though, a socialist at the top of the ticket who wants the Boston bomber to vote from prison, who wants open borders, who wants a dismantled Wall Street, who wants to revolutionize the capitalist system and do away with the internal combustion engine. You -- when you face off against Trump with someone like that are facing a 40-state landslide. And that's what they are going to have to reckon with. GUTFELD: Hey, Dana, I want to play you some sound on tape of Chris Matthews. Would you like to hear it? PERINO: Please. GUTFELD: All right. Let s roll that for Dana. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I've seen what socialism is like. I don't like it, OK? It's not only not free, it doesn't freaking work. It just doesn't work. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Yes. But the thing is -- here's the deal. Didn't he play some role in this? He is like a guy who ate a large cake everyday for 30 years and then woke up and realized they need a crane to get him out of bed. PERINO: Well, I think he is sounding the alarm because he does remember what it was like. And he remembers watching Ronald Reagan who stayed against socialism and how that built a generation of people that were very pro-capitalist and pro-America. And I think that he realized is that those people in America still exist. Bernie Sanders is right that no matter who the nominee is, though, they are going to have to reckon with this issue. They will probably be labelled as a socialist, maybe not directly by President Trump. But that will be the message from the supporters. And they're going to have to figure out a way to deal with it. And I think this also falls along generational lines. These polls that came out today show that Bernie Sanders has got a really good grip on the youth, like the younger people, and somebody like a Biden has the older people, because I think that this socialism issue is not just about temperament. I think it's also about the issues. GUTFELD: Biden does have a good grip on younger people, but not the way he should. Katie, what are your thoughts on this -- do you think this is overblown? PAVLICH: No, I don't. I think that people severely underestimate the socialism message that is based on lies. I have a t-shirt that says socialism, communism killed 100,000 million people and all got was this lousy t-shirt. Young people, when you ask them what socialism, they can't actually define it. And by the Democrats not standing up and saying, yes, I have a problem with it on the stage. It proves that there are no moderates running in the Democratic Party, and they deserve the label of being socialist. And Bernie Sanders, you know, the question on MSNBC after Chris Matthews said that was, well, is he like a Denmark socialist or is he like a Cuban communist? If you go back and listen to Bernie Sanders' own words about Cuban communism, he was excited about Fidel Castro who was responsible for the murder of the hundreds of thousands of people. He said that redlines in Nicaragua were a good example of how the economy works. So when we are talking about policy here, these are just differences in minor policy. These are about two completely different structures for the future of the country. And it should not be underestimated, considering how many young people are falling for the messaging on it. GUTFELD: Hey, Juan, I have a theory about Amy Klobuchar. I think she might be Trump's toughest challenge. Because if candidates were like a mountain that you have to climb, it's hard to find the nooks and crannies on Klobuchar that you can call Ms. Warren Pocahontas. You can call Biden old and frail, and Bernie socialist, but what do you call her, nothing. WILLIAMS: I'm sure he will come up with something. He's pretty good at nicknames and bullying people. You know, I just watch you guys, and I think, wait a minute. These guys are so pro-Bernie, but now they're going anti-Bernie. And I'm thinking they must see Bernie as really coming on, right? But let me just say with regard to Bernie and this communism, which the president said he is a communist. PERINO: Well, he is. WILLIAMS: The socialist thing is just wacky. I mean, look. He is not for having the government control the means of production in this country. PERINO: But he is actually. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: Hang on. What Bernie is talking about, and by the way, most Democrats support, is the idea that you need a stronger social safety net in this country to deal with healthcare, to deal with the high cost -- (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: That is not a safety net, Juan. WILLIAMS: Hold on. Let me finish. The deal with the high cost of education, especially college education debt that is such a problem for young people. And not only that, you have so many issues that already -- we are so called socialist on. If you want to go at social security, I know the president said to his big rich friends over in Davos. Yeah, well, you know, we have to look at Medicare. That is socialism. But that's because we are caring American people. PAVLICH: And they're all going broke, Juan. All of the programs are going broke, Juan. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: You guys just go on and on. You won't let me talk. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: This not is socialism. This is America caring about its people, and that's what you are seeing from not only -- (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: -- from Democrats who support that idea. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: The bread lines aren't compassionate. WILLIAMS: It is not bread lines. This is fair wages. Instead of giving tax cuts to the rich, which is a socialism of a different kind. It is not my kind. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: Coming up next, Joe Biden caught in another bizarre campaign moment as his polling tanks. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PERINO: Tomorrow's New Hampshire primary could be a make or break moment for Joe Biden's campaign. So after a fourth-place finish in Iowa, Biden getting more bad news out of the granite state, the former VP is tied with Elizabeth Warren for fourth place. It comes as Biden is getting attention for another exchange he had with a voter. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN: It is a good question. Number one, Iowa is a Democratic caucus. Have you ever been to a caucus? No, you haven't. You're a lying dog face pony soldier. You said you were. But now you have got to be honest. I'm going to be honest with you. It was a little bit confusing in Iowa. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: So that was kind of strange. And now, the mainstream media is starting to write Biden off. Here are just some of the headlines. Joe Biden is running out of gas, Joe Biden on the ropes. Democratic establishment eyes Bloomberg as Biden falters. So he is having a little bit of a moment here. Just to add a little bit of fun here, Greg. I pulled a little sound from Tom Shillue, who is, of course, on the G.G. Show. Maybe you could set it up for what you had him do. GUTFELD: What did I have him do? I have him pretended that he is Joe Biden. PERINO: Making insults. OK, watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look, you fly a corvette directly into the sun. You're going to end up in 1983. Everyone knows that. I am serious. I have got a speeding ticket from a Minotaur. That is a half man, half bull, Chicago Bulls. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: I love it. It is so cute. GUTFELD: You know what -- what Tom is doing is that he kind of understands that Biden is kind of confrontational with people, right? He is like, whenever he is talk -- he said what are you doing, man? It is always that way, where Trump is more confrontational with things, like the media as a whole, and politics as a whole. Biden gets kind of individualistic in the people he goes to. The phrase that he used in that case was from John Wayne, which is a fine thing if you get the reference. But you want to keep your references within the last half-century. Because -- and the bottom line is if Jesse had made that reference to Katie or you on this show, every media vlog, they would not care if it was from John Wayne. PAVLICH: We are not allowed to quote John Wayne anymore. GUTFELD: Why not? PERINO: Well, I wanted to play some sound for Jesse Watters here. This is Biden talking about how he is winning nationally. OK, if we can play that for him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN: I am still winning nationally. And you guys keep forgetting that part, OK, number one. Number two, the fact is that the first two states are important. But they don't make -- they don't determine the outcome. Number three, we have not had a debate yet. We have a minute and fifteen second assertions. You call these debates? I have been in debates. I debated Paul Ryan. I debated that woman from Alaska who could see Russia. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Oh, that woman from Alaska. GUTFELD: He never said that. PERINO: Saturday Night Live said it. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: Hell of a crowd he had in that classroom. I mean, wow. That was like where you go when you get in trouble after school and you're the only one sitting in an empty classroom. He doesn't even sell that he's in first place nationally. I mean, he's hunched over, looks like he's about to collapse. And it's not true anymore. I think it was Quinnipiac that just came out, Bernie has now surged ahead of him, and he's in first place nationally. Biden is now trapped in a negative news cycle that he created. If any other candidate called some random woman a dog-faced pony soldier. You'd say this guy is folksy. He's got color. He's the kind of guy you want to have a beer with. But the fact that Biden you know, was massaging people and saying things about record players and stock tape and all this crazy and Korean pop. I mean, this just comes on a long line of negative headlines for him. So when he said something like this, you just roll your eyes and that's the problem. Can he have a comeback? We'll see the media wants to write about the Biden question, but he might not have been far enough to have one. PERINO: That's a great question. I don't know. I don't think -- I don't know if the media is looking to write that one. I think that they're looking to try to find a way to get to yes with Mayor Pete. But let me ask Juan about Biden. Do you think that if he comes in fourth or fifth in New Hampshire, that that's OK? WILLIAMS: Yes. But it'd be better if he came in third. Obviously, he's really struggling at the moment. I mean, he needs to shift some kind of media strategy. He's got to get out there. He's -- you know, no off the record, no gaggles. I think he's got to get himself in front of a T.V. camera in front of reporters. I think he's got to be far more aggressive about that. And by the way, this thing with this John Wayne reference, it was a total joke. But I see you guys want to take it seriously and demean the man. WATTERS: No, I think it's funny. WILLIAMS: And if you want to talk about people saying horrible things in this political era, I would point to Donald Trump saying horrible crazy things. WATTERS: I'm not demeaning him. I think it's funny. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: This was -- this was meant in a totally humorous sense. And the young woman, by the way, she said she was lying to Joe Biden. She had not attended a caucus. GUTFELD: Blame the woman, Juan. Blame the woman. WILLIAMS: No, I'm just telling -- that's not blaming, that's telling you the truth. PAVLICH: I actually have a response to that point. So Dana, we hear a whole lot about suburban women and how they may like President Trump's policies, but they don't necessarily like his attitude and his behavior and some of the things that he says. Well, if Joe Biden is trying to differentiate himself, why would he continue to go to town halls in these local places he's trying to win to gain momentum and then insult people that way. So I don't know if he's trying to be a tough guy, he's trying to be like President Trump, he's trying to be like himself, where he's been for three decades. Joe Biden has kind of gotten away with Joe being Joe and he's a nice guy. But when you get down to the things that he's actually said and continues to say, he doesn't seem like he's very nice guy. And he's going to need more than that to beat Trump. PERINO: All right, we'll move on now. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, we just mention him, he's raising some eyebrows with his stance on drug legalization. That 2020 debate up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WILLIAMS: Surging Democratic candidate Pete Buttigieg has been on our role since his strong performance in Iowa. But now he's getting some attention over his stance on drug legalization. Here's Mayor Pete renewing his call to decriminalize all drug possession. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PETE BUTTIGIEG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think the main thing we need to focus on is where you have distribution and the kind of harm that's done there where yes, of course, it's important that it remain illegal but -- CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANCHOR: But you would decriminalize it so it wouldn't be illegal. BUTTIGIEG: Possession should not be dealt with through incarceration. And - - WALLACE: But your view would say that possession of heroin is not illegal. BUTTIGIEG: Is not going to be dealt with through incarceration. WALLACE: But your Web site says decriminalize. It would not be illegal. BUTTIGIEG: Yes. Or it could be a misdemeanor. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: So today I went out to Plymouth state here in New Hampshire to see the mayor and he had a crowd of about 250 people. And when he asked the question, how many of you have dealt with or have someone in your family, someone you know, dealing with drugs, and mental health issues, the whole crowd raised his hands. It was really a startling moment. And you can see why he says that 40 years of this drug war haven't succeeded. So Dana, how does this play politically? PERINO: Well, I think before you can understand how it would play politically, I think he -- I don't know if he's thoroughly thought through this policy issue, which is what Chris Wallace was exposing, and it is a complex one. And I'm not saying I have the answers to it, I don't know. But it again, I think it goes back to that generational issue where you're talking about with socialism. So like older people who grew up with war on drugs and see -- if their loved ones have died of drugs, they think this is bad. We should not have them at all. And if it's bad, that means it should be illegal. Whereas the new generation is said, no, we should make them legal so that we don't have criminal -- people being criminalized and penalized unnecessarily. And that -- I just don't think -- I think the jury is still out on it. I don't know how it plays politically. WILLIAMS: All right. Katie, I think there's an important distinction to be made. I think it's like 90 percent of Americans at this point, think that a doctor should be able to write a prescription for people who want to use marijuana. And there's a high percentage say, even for recreational use. But he's talking about things like meth, and heroin, and that strikes me differently. How does this strike you? PAVLICH: Well, there's -- there has been legalization of marijuana in a number of places. Colorado was one of them. And a lot of people who voted to push that through now come back and say they regret doing so because of the societal impacts that it had. So, you know, as Dana said, we don't have a whole lot of information, but I can imagine the effects would be the same. And we're talking about an entire structural issue here. What is -- you know, if you do A, legalized things like heroin and crack cocaine or whatever else he wants to legalize, are there then going to be more victims of crime as a result of these people not being in jail? I mean, these are big questions, and also, structurally, the federal government has a lot of agencies dedicated to the drug war. So the DEA would have to be eliminated, you'd have lots of parts of ICE and Border Patrol that would no longer be functioning in that capacity. So it's a very big issue. I'm open to lots of arguments about how legalizing marijuana in the United States or other drugs that actually help decrease the violence in places like Chicago and Mexico. But it's not just a talking point answer. And I don't think that Mayor Pete did a very good job of explaining more thoroughly how he would handle the consequences because it would not be a seamless transition. WILLIAMS: That's a good point. I mean, there would be unintended public health consequences. Greg, you know, I was thinking when I was listening to him, maybe he's making play for you for the libertarian vote. GUTFELD: Well, I think so. I mean, the facts are this. It's illegal opiates that are killing people, not legal opiates. My belief and it's always been this which is why I agree with him about all drugs is that legality creates feasible delivery systems. If you look at a bought -- a pack of cigarettes, right? You have 20 cigarettes, each one gives you a mild narcotic kick. I'm not saying it's safe. We know it's deadly. However, if you ban a pack of cigarettes, the delivery system immediately changes. It becomes more potent and damaging because you're leaving it to street vendors to deal with that illegal thing. So when you compare legal opiates, prescriptions to fentanyl on the street, you can see the differences. People live completely normal lives on opiates, others die on the street when they get their fentanyl mixed also with their Xanax. So modulating delivery systems solve the biggest problem which renders the pleasure you get manageable chunks. So my opiate of choice when I get home from work is no different than your martini of choice. If you have five martinis that's not on society, that is on you. However, the point is, you have to plan for this kind of decision because there are intended and unintended consequences. Will homelessness increase? Will overdoses spike? Will the workforce suffer? That's where I see the problem is where the workforce might suffer. But you can't say that this will cause any worse of a problem than the drug war, because the drug war creates these unmanageable delivery systems that kill people. And when you don't prepare for the consequences, you end up with De Blasio and bail reform which is caused dramatic spikes in crimes in New York City because he didn't think about what might happen. WILLIAMS: Well, this is so -- this is a really interesting conversation. I think we're right in saying the mayor didn't really explain all this, so I want Jesse, in fact, I think as he now tries to make inroads with the black community -- and you saw the debate on Friday, he was scored on the idea that there was an increase in arrest among blacks in South Bend for marijuana possession. WATTERS: Yes. WILLIAMS: And he came back so well, but generally all this kind of stuff. But remember that the war on drug has had a disproportionate impact on minority and poor people in terms of incarceration. Maybe that's the play he's making. WATTERS: Maybe he's pandering. I respectfully disagree with Mayor Greg over here. I don't think he'd thought this out. As Dana said, he's not ready for prime time. If you run a candidate on the left that wants to legalize narcotics possession in the United States of America, Trump will chew him out and spit them out, and it won't even be close. This is just what the Chinese want. The Chinese would love to decriminalize narcotics possession in this country. GUTFELD: That's not true. WATTERS: It makes it much easier for them --- GUTFELD: They sell us the drugs. WATTERS: Exactly, they're selling us the drugs and then we don't do anything about it. GUTFELD: No. WATTERS: Listen, Mayor Greg. You had your chance. GUTFELD: No, they're selling the street drugs one. WATTERS: And this is the problem. If you decriminalize meth and you decriminalize the possession of heroin -- GUTFELD: So I become (INAUDIBLE) WATTERS: It will make people feel like they can walk around and do drugs in public without any consequence. GUTFELD: What's wrong with that? WATTERS: They can shoot up outside of my apartment and not get a ticket. GUTFELD: That's not how you take it. WATTERS: They can smoke it outside of my apartment and not go to jail. GUTFELD: That's you. That is you. WATTERS: I want people going to jail. I want people hitting rock bottom. WILLIAMS: Gentlemen, gentlemen, calm, calm. WATTERS: I want people go cold turkey and then they can go out and rehab. GUTFELD: That's not your choice. WATTERS: Greg doesn't want to live in society with boundaries, I do. WILLIAMS: Hey, guys, it's 5:00 somewhere. It's 5:00 somewhere. We can have a drink and settle this later. Coming up, Hollywood, A-listers get political at the Oscars. Plus, more highlights from the big night next on THE FIVE. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PAVLICH: Liberal Hollywood once again lecturing America at the Oscars with some truly bizarre rants. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOAQUIN PHOENIX, ACTOR: We go into the natural world and we plunder it for its resources. We feel entitled to artificially inseminated a cow. And when she gives birth, we steal her baby. Even though her cries of anguish are mistakable And then we take from milk that's intended for a calf, and we put it in our coffee and our cereal. (END VIDEO CLIP) PAVLICH: So Karl Marx, Greg, also got a shout out and Brad Pitt made a reference to impeachment and John Bolton in an unfunny way. Your thoughts about the Oscars. GUTFELD: Well, I've always -- I love Joaquin Phoenix because I know that everything he says comes from a good place. And the second part of that speech, he went off on cancel culture, which I thought was an important thing to say. He probably has friends that have been canceled. I thought Maya Rudolph and Kristen Wiig were amazing -- WATTERS: Yes, they were funny. GUTFELD: -- with their medley of songs about costumes, no music back -- behind them, and it was the funniest thing I've ever seen in the Oscars. But, you know, I felt bad for Brad Pitt, because he paid so much money to an agency for that joke, and he thought it really landed. And now for the rest of his life, for that moment, it's going to be about a dumb joke. He should have just enjoyed it. But you know what? I stopped watching it because my wife said to me, you know, Greg, this isn't for you. And I go, you're right and I left. And she goes, where you going, where are you going, you're going to watch with me. And I go, no, it's not for me. So that's what this does to America. It cleaves -- it cleaves us. PAVLICH: Poor Brad Pitt. Dana, who do you think is best dressed? PERINO: Well, we were -- we're here up in New Hampshire so I didn't get to see the Oscars. But the truth is, I never watched the Oscars because I'm always late to see the movies because I don't go to the movie theater. I wait till they can get them on Netflix or whatever. And I think that when it comes to comments about animal rights, or even about politics, I've just never taken much stock in what Hollywood has to say. And I guess last night was no different. PAVLICH: Juan? WILLIAMS: Well, I think just like, you know, when you hear Brad Pitt make some comments and people on the right don't like it, I guess you should say wait a minute, we also say that what Hollywood says is not relevant. So take it with a grain of salt. It's like when I hear something that Ted Nugent says, I just take it with a grain of salt. I don't think all people on the right think like that. By the way, why don't they celebrate movies that actually people go to. Because so many people don't go to the movies that they're talking about, you know. PAVLICH: That's a good question, Juan. WILLIAMS: I think the Joker is the only movie that was a top 10 movie, that was the only one, and they legitimately didn't deserve to win so -- hats off by the way to Parasite. PAVLICH: OK, Jesse, final word to you sounding off on the -- WATTERS: I mean, it looked like Zach Galifianakis hearing an impression of Joaquin Phoenix's acceptance speech. I don't know. I think Joaquin Phoenix is almost too compassionate. You know, when I pour milk into my coffee, I don't think about the cow. GUTFELD: We know that. WATTERS: I think about not spilling my milk. I mean, maybe he's got mad cow disease. I don't know. PAVLICH: OK, ""ONE MORE THING"" -- PERINO: Katie, I'm sorry if you heard me sneeze there. WATTERS: God bless you, Dana. PAVLICH: God bless you. ""ONE MORE THING"" is up next. PERINO: Thank you. Thank you, America. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WATTERS: Time now for ""ONE MORE THING."" Greg? GUTFELD: Well, Hollywood lost a major legend Friday night. It was Orson Bean. He died at the young age of 91. Tragically, he was hit by a car in Venice as he was, I believe, walking home. He's been in a ton of movies. You've seen him in so much stuff, TV shows like Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman, Fernwood 2 Night, Desperate Housewives. He was in being -- the doctor Being John Malkovich. He was in probably one of the more memorable twilight zones. He was blacklisted. I grew up watching him and countless game shows like password and to tell the truth. But I got to become a friend of his because he was Andrew Breitbart's father in law. And I used to go to when I'd see Andrew and or see Orson, and he was such a wonderful, just a wonderful person. And I mean, this weekend we've lost him, and Robert Conrad, and Kirk Douglas. I mean, we're losing a lot of interesting people. We got to make sure we're replacing them. I wrote an obituary. It's up there at FoxNews.com and you can find a podcast I did with Orson from a few months ago. WATTERS: All right, well said, Greg. All right, so on Thursday, I was speaking at the South Georgia Medical Center Foundation in Valdosta Georgia. There I am. A lot of questions about Juan Williams, I got to say. Usually, I get asked about Greg but I got a lot of Juan questions. And Juan, I did do justice. Don't worry about a thing. WILLIAMS: Way to go, man. Take care of me, Jesse. WATTERS: Also, on Friday, I was at the father-daughter dance with my daughters Eliana and Sophia. There I am dancing up a storm, only a few toes were stepped on. And they definitely got their dancing skills from their dad. PAVLICH: That's very nice. WATTERS: Dana? WILLIAMS: Oh my gosh. PERINO: Well, there was a big explosion in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, but it was a kind that they designed and they worked on. It was a steamboat fireworks. They set a world record Saturday Night. Watch. So that was at the Steamboat Springs sort of -- it's called a night extravaganza. It's a festival that they have. They've been trying to do this with a Guinness Book of World Records who was there certifying indeed was the largest one ever. And Tim Borden who heads the team over there in Colorado says, wait till next year. So we'll see what they have in store. PAVLICH: Pretty neat. PERINO: I mean, if you didn't know it was fireworks, you might have been scared. WATTERS: Wait, so they broke the Guinness Book of World Record or they didn't break it? PERINO: They broke the world record. WATTERS: Oh, they broke it, OK. Because that would be pretty bad if they called Guinness and they showed up and they didn't break. But that's happened a few times. PERINO: I don't know. I think I'm running out of brainpower. WILLIAMS: It's OK. She sneezed a minute ago. Maybe you know -- all right. WATTERS: All right, Juan. PERINO: I'll do better tomorrow, I promise. WILLIAMS: All right, so I'm a big fan of Cosmo Cougar, Brigham Young University's mascot for his famous dance moves. But now Cosmo is blasting off to a whole new level. Take a look at this, folks. Yes, he launched from behind the three-point line for that slam dunk. Take a look at this in slo-mo. The BYU dunk team threw Cosmo into the air. He traveled 22 feet before throwing down the dunk. That's one high flying cool cougar. Go Cosmo. PERINO: Yours was way better than mine, Juan. PAVLICH: At least you sign a waiver for that. WATTERS: All right, Katie. PAVLICH: All right, so this past Friday, a funeral service was held for Staff Sergeant Clyde Baldwin, at Pikes Peak National Cemetery in Colorado. Despite lots of snow, hundreds of people came to honor this veteran who served in the U.S. Air Force from 1950 to 1970, and recently passed at the age of 91. He didn't have much family but the family he did have were unable to attend. So a number of veterans groups posted about the funeral. And despite horrible driving conditions and cold weather, people not knowing him personally, hundreds of people came. So it is an amazing way to honor his memory and his service and I think a good vision of America and the way that Americans feel about each other. PERINO: So special. WATTERS: Very nice. PERINO: Thank you to him. WILLIAMS: Way to go. WATTERS: All right, will Juan have fun at the Trump rally tonight in New Hampshire? Just trying to stand at trouble. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: Hey, I'm going to give bring the hat back for you. WATTERS: All right, set your DVRs. Never miss an episode of ""The Five.""

84,FOX,"Democratic Party appears headed for a big divide; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" February 7, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Hi, everyone. I'm Juan Williams along with Emily Compagno, Pete Hegseth, Dana Perino, and Gregory Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City. This is The Five.  President Trump in a triumphant mood while Democrats reeling from the fallout over the Iowa caucuses. The president boasting about his impeachment acquittal while attacking Speaker Nancy Pelosi.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: I think there is a lot of evil on that side. They've gone crazy. They've gone totally crazy. Should they expunge the impeachment in the House? They should because it was a hoax. It was a total political hoax. I thought it was a terrible thing when she ripped up the speech. First of all, it's an official document, you are not allowed. It's illegal what she did. She broke the law.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: The president also mocking Democrats over how the Iowa caucuses were handled.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: They understand the votes are fried in Iowa. They -- they couldn't even take a simple tabulation. And yet, they are telling you how to run the country and how to run health care. They have no idea who won. They have no idea.  But I will tell you who won, the Republican side. They accounted for every single vote. And it was a lot of votes. It was a record-setting number of votes. Trump won.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: While President Trump tries to capitalize off the Iowa Democrats' chaos, the Democratic Party is heading for a big divide. Election forecaster Nate Silver is giving Bernie Sanders a 50/50 shot at winning the entire game of the party's nomination. Many Democrats they're not happy about that including Hillary Clinton.  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Yes.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: Vote for the person that you believe can actually win in November. And the person who you think can govern your country. But you've got to be responsible for what you say. And what you say you are going to do.  We need to rebuild trust in our fellow Americans and in our institutions and if you promise the moon and you can't deliver the moon, then that's going to be one more indicator of how, you know, we just can't trust each other.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: I don't know.  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Goh. Honestly, that doesn't make any sense. Sorry. It's Friday.  WILLIAMS: you don't think that doesn't make sense? She doesn't like Bernie Sanders.  PERINO: No, I get it. I just -- you know, I'm tried to be really nice. OK. So --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Don't be nice. Say what you think, Dana.  WILLIAMS: No.  GUTFELD: This is The Five. This isn't Fox & Friends.  PERINO: When she was --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Hey, don't take a shot at the guest.  PERINO: So, while she's talking, I'm like, I really don't see her landing any point. It's just the same thing you've been hearing since 2008. Really when she ran against Barack Obama and lost in that primary. And then with the Bernie Sanders thing I just -- the Democrats have had such a bad week.  I read all the coverage this morning. It was like, I was really enjoying myself. But David Brooks, for example, in the New York Times writes, are Democrats trying to throw away -- are Democrats going to throw away an election?  You have James Carville in vox.com, do yourself a favor, go there, read the interview that he does. It is priceless in which he says, we are in a terrible state. And then you have Jonathan Chait --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: So, you think when he says the f words.  PERINO: Yes, that's the good part. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that in the next bloc.  GUTFELD: OK.  PERINO: So, you got to stick around for that. Then Jonathan Chait who writes at New York magazine, he's like, we actually are in such bad shape that we might look back at this week and think it was the high point of the election.  So, it's not just the Republicans are saying the Democrats are having a bad week. Like Donna Brazile was just on with Bill Hemmer, she says, that was embarrassing in Iowa on Tuesday night. Like it's just bad. I think America needs a weekend.  GUTFELD: No.  WILLIAMS: America needs a weekend.  PERINO: Yes. The Democrats needs a weekend. America needs a weekend. I need a weekend.  GUTFELD: No.  WILLIAMS: Well, I tell you -- I tell you who doesn't seem to be quite as happy as you would think, is Donald Trump. Pete, he says he wants Nancy Pelosi and the House to expunge the impeachment. He's still fuming.  PETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: No. I actually came on the show tonight, Juan, to check on your health.  WILLIAMS: Thank you, thank you.  HEGSETH: So, because you're doing OK after this week. And if you want a week, come and I said Fox & Friends for the weekend --  PERINO: For the weekend?  HEGSETH: -- we'll still be talking about the best week ever. Remember that show?  GUTFELD: That's my -- that's my -- that's what I'm doing tomorrow night.  HEGSETH: All right. The best week ever absolutely for the president, he has his own style and way of spiking the football but when you look at the State of the Union, the acquittal, 49 percent on Gallup approval rating up from 39 since the thing start -- the thing started.  Ninety-four percent GOP approval, 90 percent of people are satisfied with their personal life.  PERINO: Yes.  HEGSETH: I think President Trump can take credit for that.  GUTFELD: Not me.  HEGSETH: Except for Greg Gutfeld. Two hundred twenty-five thousand jobs added. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman fired. This is a White House totally undeterred by someone who -- why would you want that guy inside your White House?  So, and then you turn to the Democrats and say when you've got your former nominee who couldn't win claiming that they need to nominate someone who can win, and then you've got the guy --  PERINO: Yes.  HEGSETH: -- you've got the new front runner is the mayor of the fourth loud -- largest town in Indiana. This is as bad of a moment as Democrats have had and we are talking all about Iowa?  Look at Milwaukee where the top aides for the convention has now resigned and said we can't even handle the convention that's coming. And how many months from now? Around four or five. It's a disaster --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: I don't know that they were Democrats. But let me just say this. Do you think that things will change once there is a Democratic nominee? All this vindictive behavior by the president like, you know, people will say, huh?  GUTFELD: You just heard everything he said.  HEGSETH: Fifty-fifty percent chance that they nominate a socialist who is not even a Democrat and that's from the New York Times who the last person they want is Bernie Sanders.  PERINO: Yes.  WILLIAMS: Wait a second.  HEGSETH: How does it change?  WILLIAMS: I think -- I think Trump would very much like to face Bernie Sanders.  PERINO: I don't know.  HEGSETH: I agree.  WILLIAMS: You agree? All right. So, you know, one of the things that's been puzzling me as Trump says, you know, Russian interference is a hoax, but aren't you -- isn't anybody concerned that the Russians are still interfering and they might do it again? I don't get it. So, when he comes out and says, it's like, nothing ever happened, nothing changes.  GUTFELD: Nothing really -- nothing really changes, Juan.  EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS HOST: Yes. And I think to borrow one of Hillary Clinton's phrases in that really odd speech. You know, when you promise the moon and then you can't deliver, that's what's been happening in this entire time.  The Democrats to me, you know they've always been -- we talk about this all the time. They are pushing the goal, they've moving the football, they're saying it's the Mueller investigation, it's Russia, it's impeachment, it's this.  And now they've messed up Iowa, they messed up the State of the Union. This is not an isolated event. Everything that occurs, they make fools of themselves, and to me, they are like zombies running around eating each other and pointing fingers, and then trying to drag us into it.  So now for example, we have the Iowa congresswoman saying look, Tom Perez, you should resign. Then we have him blaming the Iowa state Democrats saying that this debacle is their fault.  At every part of the way, they are pointing fingers at each other or pointing fingers at Trump without offering any type of solutions. We have nothing to show for it as citizens who have benefited not at all from this and they have nothing to show for it because they are continuing to reveal themselves as inept laughing stocks.  WILLIAMS: Wow. OK. Greg, you had a strong reaction to Hillary.  GUTFELD: No. I want to talk about, well, first, I want to talk about Iowa. Saying it's in disarray is like saying the Grand Canyon is a hole. This is really, really bad. We always talk about this was their first day of school and they showed up wearing their dad's golf bag with their mom's wedding dress over it.  There's something seriously irrevocably wrong about it. Trump -- we're talking about Trump's victory lap. We deserve a victory lap because we were put through what, two months of this crap?  PERINO: Six.  GUTFELD: Six months of all of this crap. I yelled at the producers every day about the hearings. But I don't want --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: Yes, they deserve an apology.  GUTFELD: I don't -- no, no, no, they should be apologizing. No. The Democrats should be apologizing to our producers because I can't -- yelling at the producers -- because at hearings they were, it was like watching people with constipation eating bran. It was just a bad scene.  So, the victory lap should not just be Trump but it should be everybody who had to be put through the charade. lastly, the big picture, the contrast. OK? The contrast between the Republican Party whose numbers and appeal are growing and the Democratic Party whose numbers are going down.  Right now, you've got three metrics with the Republican Party. You have jobs which are soaring, you got satisfaction which is soaring, you got wages which are going up. OK? What are the Democrats' counter offer? Division, impeachment, race baiting, cancel culture, going after people in their own party for saying the wrong thing.  They're pitting identity groups against each other. It's a hateful, hateful place. The Democratic Party is supposed to be about compassion and love and they are eating themselves alive. You have Liz Warren blaming America for her toxic work culture. I mean, it's a joke. You guys -- I mean, watch his face, that southerner dude you are talking about?  PERINO: Carville?  GUTFELD: Carville is so right. He's so right. He's trying to save his own party.  PERINO: The thing is, there is no mercy rule in politics. So, when you ask, are things going to change when there's a nominee, like, if you are winning, you just want to keep winning.  COMPAGNO: By the way --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Yes. But wait a minute. Do you know who is winning? Bernie Sanders. Right.  PERINO: Against Trump.  WILLIAMS: Pete Buttigieg. Joe Biden all beat Trump right now.  GUTFELD: Joe Biden is winning?  WILLIAMS: Yes, over Trump.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Until they become the single nominee and then it's over.  WILLIAMS: I'm just telling you, once you get a nominee, this is what I was saying to Dana. Once you get a nominee, this dynamic shift and all of those people --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: Maybe.  WILLIAMS: -- if they were the nominee right now would beat Donald Trump.  GUTFELD: And then that would fall apart.  COMPAGNO: We can't ignore that court case today, you guys. That was a significant development. And yes, it was on standing. But the fact that the D.C. circuit, the federal court of appeals ruled in Trump's favor and said, hey, Democrats, hey, lawmakers, you can't sue the president in court over the emolument clause. Remember, that was another huge talking point from the Democrats --  GUTFELD: Yes.  COMPAGNO: -- for the last three years? That failed also. It's one more thing.  PERINO: Maybe they don't need a weekend.  WILLIAMS: All right.  PERINO: They need a drink.  GUTFELD: Yes. I like the -- I wanted to keep going. Let's just go straight through the Monday.  WILLIAMS: No. Hey, hey, hey, guys, we've got to go. We going to have another segment. You can keep coming. All right.  Up next -- I think they are so happy. Up next, growing concerns about Joe Biden's campaign as the 2020 race turns to New Hampshire. Stay with The Five. We're having fun.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  HEGSETH: Outstanding. All right. Forget about, where is Hunter? The real question is where is Joe Biden? The former V.P. has been MIA from the campaign trail ahead of the New Hampshire primary, which as I recall is next week.  It comes after an embarrassing fourth-place show in Iowa once they finally get around to counting them all.  And check out this new poll out of the granite state, in New Hampshire. Bernie out-front with Mayor Pete Buttigieg surging while Biden stuck in third and sinking quickly.  Juan, I'll go to you. You just said Biden is winning. He lost big in Iowa. he -- the reports are he's gone back to Delaware to huddle with his team. If you hope to win a state, you're usually out in that state trying to win more votes, instead they are also spending money in other states. Is this the end for Joe Biden?  WILLIAMS: Not even close. But they are shifting money, you're right, shifting money to Nevada and that shows you the importance of two upcoming races. the first Nevada and the second South Carolina. He really needs to reinforce the idea that he can win.  Iowa, you know, he wasn't even sure he was going to compete there, then decided to go in. New Hampshire is Bernie's neighboring state to Bernie Sanders Vermont and Bernie clearly has the lead there, so.  But I think lots of people especially the Trumpian types who are so fearful of Joe Biden are quick to throw dirt on the grail.  (CROSSTALK)  HEGSETH: Well, I think the fear has totally dissipated. Is there -- is there anyone here at the table that fears --  GUTFELD: I'm shivering.  HEGSETH: -- fear from Joe Biden at this point?  COMPAGNO: Only if he touches me.  WILLIAMS: Wow. Holy smokes. Let's no go in there.  COMPAGNO: I'm -- OK. I think that Biden is the next Beto. He is the desert mirage. And think about the two biggest things that everyone said about him. That basically he's infallible. Right? He's always leading in the national polls.  Well, we just saw him basically be decimated in Iowa and guess who gobbled up his votes as is being indicated in New Hampshire, Buttigieg who went from 11 percent to 23 there. And then the second kind of immovable characteristic about Biden is the fact that he had all of the voters of color. And now not only did Sanders get more voters of color than he did when he in 2016, but now even Buttigieg got more voters of color than Biden.  GUTFELD: I like when you say his name.  HEGSETH: Is it Buttigieg?  GUTFELD: It's Buttigieg.  COMPAGNO: So, I'm just saying -- I'm just saying Mayor Pete. I'm just saying that, basically everything about Biden that we thought was, you know, set in stone --  GUTFELD: Yes.  COMPAGNO: -- has been totally obliterated and we're only in Iowa.  WILLIAMS: What are you talking about? Where did you get more voters of color?  COMPAGNO: Everything. Right here  HEGSETH: He got more voters of color in Iowa that Biden did.  WILLIAMS: Let me just say -- let me just say --  (CROSSTALK)  COMPAGNO: Outpace Biden 50 percent to 30 percent.  WILLIAMS: -- that's pretty hard to do because there aren't many voters of color in Iowa. OK?  HEGSETH: What do you think, Dana?  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: So, I think, so Mayor Pete has said, as he said, if they come within five of Joe Biden -- I'm sorry, of Sanders on Tuesday, they will consider that a win for them because that's Sanders' home turf, he won it in 2016. For Biden he has a chance tonight to see if this retreat that he had in Delaware --  HEGSETH: Maybe he's preparing for tonight.  PERINO: Well --  WILLIAMS: That's right.  PERINO: No. I think look, they knew they had a to make a change. They've already started to announce them. And part of them what they need to do is they need to show that they are willing to make some changes so that the media will write that they recognize that they have a problem, they need to make some changes.  He has started to try to punch now against Bernie Sanders and Mayor Pete, but it's hard for him to land a punch.  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: And you -- some people think he should've been punching for a long time because now Bernie Sanders, he's got this the big M.O. as Bush 41 used to say. But it would be an amazing comeback story if he wins in New Hampshire or Nevada or South Carolina.  HEGSETH: I mean, Greg, do you see comeback Joe here making a big change?  GUTFELD: I see go away Joe in a polite -- what they're trying to figure out a way. I don't know. Did you want to ask me about Liz?  HEGSETH: I do.  GUTFELD: Yes. I want --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: It is amazing. If you get in third place --  (CROSSTALK)  HEGSETH: Actually, we got a clip. Hold on. We've got a clip of Liz Warren. Remember she's --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Yes. She's getting away with murder here.  HEGSETH: Watch this.  GUTFELD: Metaphorically.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I believe these women without any equivocation. And I apologize, personality that they had a bad experience on the campaign. I'm also very aware that racism and oppression in this country has left a long legacy. I take responsibility for this and I'm working with my team to address this kind of stuff.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  HEGSETH: You had eight women of color quit her campaign in Nevada. That's her response. What do you think?  GUTFELD: I don't know if maybe Emily and Dana should cover their ears because I'm going to say something very mean.  PERINO: I'm all ears.  GUTFELD: She's a big -- she has a big poo-poo head. She is a big poo-poo head because she's the queen of white privilege. And she's blaming America for her sins.  This is a woman who got to where she was pretending to be a minority and then she has audacity, she finger point her to like tell -- say that it's America's long history of racism and stuff.  You know, it tells you how bad the Democrat Party is right now. And she is getting -- because it's such a mess, she was able to sneak by. Did you even remember that there is a debate tonight? A three-hour debate. Who on Friday night, who on Friday night is going to sit through a debate with these clowns? Maybe the bozos at Newsweek. I don't know. But nobody. We all have lives. I'm going to go out to dinner. What are you going to do?  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: I have to unpack and repack.  WILLIAMS: Yes. But you know what? It's going to make news.  GUTFELD: It'll probably, it might make news.  WILLIAMS: They will make news. Let's catch it in the Saturday morning paper.  GUTFELD: What do you think is going to happen?  WILLIAMS: Well, I mean, look, Pete, you said it a moment ago. Pete Buttigieg is the mayor of, what do you say the fourth largest --  (CROSSTALK)  HEGSETH: The fourth largest town in Indiana.  WILLIAMS: OK. All right. So, can you imagine --  (CROSSTALK)  HEGSETH: Come on.  WILLIAMS: -- if you -- all right. So, yes. But if you're Joe Biden's campaign manager's strategist that's what you are saying. Hey, remind people this guy has never won make a statewide election.  GUTFELD: So, you're going to see Biden --  HEGSETH: That Biden works?  WILLIAMS: So, if you're -- if you're advising him on Sanders, again --  (CROSSTALK)  HEGSETH: But do you really think he's capable of delivering --  WILLIAMS: Yes. No. Stop. Please.  HEGSETH: -- you can watch this guy in debate performances.  WILLIAMS: He's -- he'll do fine.  HEGSETH: No, he's meandering from one answer to another and then he's making a joke and then the moderator cuts him off so he stops.  WILLIAMS: Pete, Pete, he was trying to play vanilla because if this is a referendum on Donald Trump --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: That's racist, Juan.  WILLIAMS: -- Donald Trump loses. So, he, everybody on the Democratic side is saying, look, just play it easy. He's made a mistake, he needs to become more forward and imagine, what would Donald Trump say about Bernie Sanders. He already has said it this week, communist.  GUTFELD: Yes, he's right.  PERINO: Well, I mean. Well, yes.  GUTFELD: He is.  PERINO: Mayor Pete, I just want to say about Mayor Pete and this idea that he is only a mayor of this small town.  HEGSETH: Yes.  PERINO: So, I remember this dinner with Barack Obama in 2006.  GUTFELD: It must be nice.  PERINO: I know. Look, listen. So, I was just a deputy press secretary at the time. He was first term there. We got -- we got to talking because we're sitting at the same table. I got home and Peter said, how was your dinner? I said I got to meet the new senator from Illinois, Barack Obama, he's a really nice guy. I could see him being president in like, 20 years.  And lo and behold he is the nominee and he is the president. So, a community organizer and somebody who had served two terms in the Senate became president. I wouldn't say that somebody like Mayor Pete couldn't do it.  GUTFELD: That's different than mayor of --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: No. But --  PERINO: Community organizer?  GUTFELD: The way you say it.  COMPAGNO: He is soaring. He is surging  PERINO: Yes.  HEGSETH: You just look him -- you just look at him on a stage against Donald Trump.  (CROSSTALK)  COMPAGNO: He needs a lot of support.  WILLIAMS: Can I --  PERINO: No, I agree but I just --  HEGSETH: Hold on. Last point.  WILLIAMS: But I just want to make one last point.  HEGSETH: Real quick.  WILLIAMS: One last point, South Carolina and Nevada are not Buttigieg territory. And I just -- there's the poll that don't show -- nobody thinks that.  PERINO: That's true.  HEGSETH: So, Juan predict it even more chaos for the Democrats.  All right. Growing coronavirus concerns in the U.S. A big update on that cruise ship docked a couple of miles from here in New Jersey, coming up.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PERINO: Health officials are not taking any chances as the coronavirus outbreak threaten to put Americans at risk. A cruise ship making an unscheduled stop in New Jersey, just miles from millions of people here in New York City. Four passengers taken to a hospital for further evaluation.  And another cruise ship off the coast of Japan is under quarantine with 61 sick passengers. They are about 2,600 people aboard that ship including more than 400 Americans.  So far, the coronavirus has killed over 600 people globally.  Greg, I wanted to point out that this ship that made an unscheduled stop in New Jersey, passengers on that ship told our Bryan Llenas that they learned about their quarantine and this unscheduled stop from watching Fox News, not from the cruise line itself.  GUTFELD: That's amazing. That's how great Fox News is. We're ahead of the game. You know, only New Jersey can dock a ship with coronavirus be considered an improvement. kidding. I love New Jersey.  PERINO: I love Jersey.  GUTFELD: I love New Jersey. I love New Jersey more than life itself actually. It's probably one of the most underrated states in the union.  HEGSETH: It is.  GUTFELD: It is. It's home of the misfits. All right. Dr. Siegel said something interesting about this -- about the cruise ship outside of Japan. That it's a perfect medical study to see how contagious the viruses --  PERINO: Yes.  GUTFELD: -- because you have the population contained there and you can see, and from what they're being -- what they're saying, is if you get the proper treatment and you -- are you -- the death rate is very low. I think it's like, I mean, 1 to 2 percent is still pretty high. That's like the flu, I think. But they're saying that this isn't -- that this isn't as bad as people say. However, I do believe that we have to make super precautions when people are coming here.  COMPAGNO: Yes.  GUTFELD: To have them and --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: When they did the press conference today, I thought they might announce more travel bans.  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: But they didn't. I want you to take a listen to Dr. Siegel, Pete, and then get your take on this. This is what he says could actually be happening in china that we don't know about.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: They roped off entire regions of up to 60 million people causing panic, cutting off supply lines, helping to spread the virus. And we now have up to 600 deaths, and I believe we have way more deaths than that and way more cases than that, probably close to 100,000 cases.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: Might not be surprising.  HEGSETH: Yes. I mean, no surprise at all --  PERINO: Yes.  HEGSETH: -- that the communist Chinese would be lying about the extent of this considering the hit their economy would take when their economy has already that many hits. And you when you are --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: And also, that they --  HEGSETH: -- collected as government you don't care about the individual, you heard them all in, there's no consequences because no information keeps them --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: Well, they don't care about anybody because let it go for two months before they told anyone.  HEGSETH: A hundred percent. So, yes. it's definitely serious. But what's mt, you mentioned Fox News. I've watched a couple of these interviews of these couples in their cabins.  PERINO: Yes.  HEGSETH: That's your experiment right there.  GUTFELD: Yes.  HEGSETH: Three weeks in a 200 square-foot cabin with your significant other, with no access to go anywhere?  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Everybody should do that.  HEGSETH: That's a reality show.  GUTFELD: Yes. Everybody should do that first.  PERINO: How would that go, Juan?  WILLIAMS: Boy, it's not good. You know, I just want to reiterate. I think that the, from what I'm reading, it's only like 2 percent or less than 2 percent -- I mean, the flu, the flu can take you out and this can take you out. But it seems to me we have to be very careful because I think media can contribute to the idea of somehow, you know, everybody should be in --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: Panicking.  WILLIAMS: -- a panic. The fact is --  PERINO: And the Trump administration came out today to say that the chances of Americans getting this is very, very low.  WILLIAMS: Yes. And I think that given our public health official success in dealing with past problems especially like recently Ebola but as far back as SARS.  GUTFELD: Zika.  WILLIAMS: They've done very well. There's reason to think that our public health officials can't deal with this.  COMPAGNO: I have so many thoughts. First is that face masks everybody are designed and should be selected for the size of particles. So just because you see one put one on, it doesn't protect yourself or other people.  Number two, yes, the biggest threat is the fact that totally the Chinese government is mischaracterizing the level of infection that's happening. And even though it is less deadly than we thought and less deadly than SARS, it's my understanding it is spreading faster, which leads me to my next point which is why we should all care a lot more about these homeless explosions especially on the west coast because of that disease.  GUTFELD: Interesting.  COMPAGNO: If we are this nervous about the coronavirus enough to put it on every block of every show, this is exactly what every network should be covering out of Skid Row in Los Angeles and the rat population explosion. Because 100 percent ever since I read outbreak at age like seven, yes, we are all going to die by a virus. That's nothing to do with temperature -- the oceans. This is how we're all going to go. You heard it here first.  WILLIAMS: Wow.  GUTFELD: Emily is Nostradamus.  COMPAGNO: Yes, diseases.  PERINO: But you should -- everybody should watch pandemic on Netflix. It's a documentary series. I watched it last week, very interesting. But you won't be scared if you --  GUTFELD: I like the amazing --  COMPAGNO: I rest my case.  PERINO: You did?  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: You like that, Greg?  GUTFELD: The first season was great.  WILLIAMS: Oh, that was terrific.  GUTFELD: Yes.  HEGSETH: I hear that handwashing is good too.  GUTFELD: You don't need to wear -- you don't need to wear the mask outside. Because actually when people put them down, it collects star stuff.  PERINO: More stuff. All right, the ""FASTEST SEVEN"" is up next.  GUTFELD: Now you know. Now you know.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  COMPAGNO: Welcome back. Time for the ""FASTEST SEVEN."" First up, Liberal California might be putting an end to school fitness test. The governor there is proposing a suspension of the tests due to concerns that they promote bullying and body discrimination. So I guess we have obesity and diabetes in one hand or bullying and discrimination on the other. Juan --  PERINO: I think I still have the sit-up record at Ellis Elementary School in Denver, Colorado and I am offended that the governor would think this.  COMPAGNO: Nice. Yes.  WILLIAMS: Is that right? The sit-up record.  COMPAGNO: Top that, Juan.  PERINO: I think I did. I think I had the sit-up record for a really long time.  GUTFELD: You were turning -- you are now Tracy Flick.  PERINO: We were the Road Runners.  WILLIAMS: Well, I think it's great. I have no -- I know that people can say this is P.C., but you know what, I think we need kids to be healthy and learn how to stay physically fit throughout life. And if people have a bad experience in elementary school -- oh, I'm not one of the fast kids, I'm not one of the, you know, strong kids, and then turn off the exercise, that's not good. So maybe we should look at new ways to get people involved.  GUTFELD: But Juan, you know what, the thing -- the thing that's great when you do terrible in sports is you go to only 1.000001 percent ends up in pro anything athletics, right? When you find out your crap at sports, what do you do, you find something you love that makes money, right? Who cares if you don't like sports?  COMPAGNO: Like Jeff Bezos.  GUTFELD: Yes, you become Bezos or you become the other dude --  WILLIAMS: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I think you said you know, you weren't so great at sports, right?  GUTFELD: I was awesome, but I chose not to perform.  WILLIAMS: OK. OK. But you stay in shape, right?  GUTFELD: I do. I do.  WILLIAMS: So take care --  GUTFELD: I jog nude in the mornings.  PERINO: Oh my god.  WILLIAMS: I missed that. But anyway, you know how to take care of yourself now, and I think that we all know --  HEGSETH: Isn't what we do in school supposed to be a reflection of what we value. I mean, California went from Arnold Schwarzenegger who was like the leader of the presidential challenge on physical fitness to Gavin Newsome, who's saying we're not going to do it. I mean, I remember doing all these things and --  PERINO: I bet your kids are good at all of it.  HEGSETH: They enjoy it. I forced them to.  GUTFELD: Do you remember -- do you remember the rope?  PERINO: I was actually good at it, but I didn't like it.  GUTFELD: I mean, in my apartment, Pete.  HEGSETH: I remember that one. It was the day that may be the most nervous in school because you wanted --  PERINO: Yes.  HEGSETH: And I think it's because --  WILLIAMS: Yes, but you had -- you had added pressure because of your dad.  HEGSETH: Well, yes. PERINO: My dad came to the -- on a field day, my dad came in the parents had to race and I'll never forget my dad in his cowboy boots beat all the other parents in the 40-yard dash.  WILLIAMS: Pretty cool.  HEGSETH: With his boots?  PERINO: In his boots.  WILLIAMS: No, I was saying that Pete's dad was a coach, so Pete's dad would require him. You know, you got to live up to your dad's --  HEGSETH: I wanted to have supper that night.  WILLIAMS: Yes, really.  COMPAGNO: I loved all those physical. I mean, I loved all that stuff. OK, next up. President Trump touting this during the State of the Union.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: We created a brand new branch of the United States Armed Forces. It's called Space Force. Very important.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  COMPAGNO: But what should the government actually call the troops of the Space Force? A top Pentagon official ruling out spaceman and space cadet, but a final determination hasn't been made and they are open to ideas. So you guys, I thought we could brainstorm I have a few ideas. Intergalactic Warriors, Galactic Defenders, Earth Defender, Star Soldier, Starfleet, Space Trooper, Stormtroopers if it's not copyrighted. If it's not copyrighted.  WILLIAMS: Stormtroopers? That's the wrong -- that's the wrong team.  COMPAGNO: OK, whatever. But I'm just saying, right? How fun that we all get to contribute. What should we name them?  GUTFELD: It should actually -- Trump should make it into a contest and whoever names it gets to have the first suit. I just think if you put space in front of anything --  PERINO: It works.  GUTFELD: It's good. It works. Space dog, spacesuit, space-space.  COMPAGNO: Do you like Galactic, Intergalactic?  PERINO: I like double space.  GUTFELD: Double-space.  WILLIAMS: Wait a second. When -- and what was the name of that movie? Toy Story. They had -- they named their hero after Buzz Aldrin.  GUTFELD: Yes  COMPAGNO: Buzz Lightyear?  WILLIAMS: Was it Buzz Lightyear?  COMPAGNO: Yes.  WILLIAMS: So you could do something --  HEGSETH: I like -- I like super troopers or space warriors. You can't do spacemen, that's too gender-specific, you know. You can't do that anymore these days.  WILLIAMS: You do space ranger.  HEGSETH: Your people -- your guys would -- you Democrats to be against that.  WILLIAMS: Space rangers?  COMPAGNO: But ranger is already --  WILLIAMS: No you can't do Spaceman.  COMPAGNO: Wait, did you guys like any of my ideas?  WILLIAMS: You know, you could do --  COMPAGNO: Intergalactic warriors, galactic defenders?  PERINO: I don't think you can do intergalactic of anything.  WILLIAMS: Space rangers or you could do -- how about space people?  COMPAGNO: Boring.  WILLIAMS: Like the Washington football team.  COMPAGNO: All right, this is an important -- this is a really important topic. We have to get to this. It's very important. Pamela Anderson reportedly says she jumped way too fast into her fifth marriage. It only lasted 12 short days. The former Baywatch star married Hollywood producer Jon Peters in a secret ceremony last month and immediately regretted the union. Anderson attributes the split to her heart being too open.  So with this topic, we got a company in like a whole packet of research. And when I read about Elizabeth Warren was married to Nicky Hilton for a short eight months, in my head --  GUTFELD: What? Liz Warren?  WILLIAMS: Who told you that?  COMPAGNO: I mean, Elizabeth -- sorry, Elizabeth Taylor. I meant Elizabeth Taylor. I thought that you're (INAUDIBLE). I have a brain. I'm sorry. Just sent away. Save me.  GUTFELD: All right, OK, 12-day marriage.  COMPAGNO: Yes.  GUTFELD: That is like, you know how dog years in Hollywood, It's a year per day. So that is a lot. 12 years they stayed together.  PERINO: You should get half.  GUTFELD: You should get half.  HEGSETH: I just love the quote from her friend or spokesperson. She does not operate at the same wavelength as other people. She has a huge heart and she loves big, fast, and hard.  PERINO: Yes. That's amazing.  HEGSETH: I'm quoting. I'm just quoting.  WILLIAMS: That was him. Not me. That was him.  HEGSETH: Just quoting.  PERINO: But when Hollywood treats marriage so cavalierly, it's like you can stop lecturing us about others, please.  WILLIAMS: Yes, but you know what, imagine if those two had been on that ship.  GUTFELD: Who knows, it might have worked --  PERINO: You know what?  GUTFELD: It might have worked out their problem.  WILLIAMS: It might have worked out their problem.  PERINO: I bet -- I bet in 12 years it's going to be a musical on Broadway about two people who met on the coronavirus ship and got married.  WILLIAMS: And stayed married hopefully.  PERINO: And their immune system was amazing.  COMPAGNO: All right, don't go anywhere, you guys. ""FAN MAIL FRIDAY"" is up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: ""FAN MAIL FRIDAY."" We're answering your questions. First one from Alex W. What is your favorite sound? Emily?  COMPAGNO: My dog.  GUTFELD: What kind of sound does he make?  COMPAGNO: Like breathing and say hi, everything, just everything about her. You know, but really, like to wake up to her little sound like being there, like with playing like (INAUDIBLE) or classical music or silence around you. I don't know. The list is long.  GUTFELD: Yes. Pete, what's your favorite sound?  HEGSETH: Besides the Fox News bomb?  PERINO: Good answer. Good answer.  HEGSETH: I don't know. Maybe -- you know the sound it makes when you turn on the hot tub and the bubble start.  GUTFELD: Oh my god. That's a great sound.  HEGSETH: That's a great sound.  GUTFELD: That's a great sound.  HEGSETH: You know you're going into something.  GUTFELD: Oh, yes, yes, yes. Pete Hegseth in a hot tub.  COMPAGNO: Nice.  GUTFELD: Fans of Pete Hegseth. All right, Juan.  WILLIAMS: Oh, I like birds in the morning.  GUTFELD: Oh that's nice. Birds in the morning are nice. Dana, you hate every sound.  PERINO: The only sound I like is when the cork coming out of a bottle.  GUTFELD: Oh, yes, the cork coming out of the bottle. Good one.  COMPAGNO: Great answers.  GUTFELD: Yes, I was going to say I like turn signals. Don't you like turn signals?  PERINO: No.  WILLIAMS: Especially when people leave them on.  GUTFELD: I know. I'm in the car --  PERINO: I hate the ding, ding, ding of those. I hate phone noises. I hate them. Nobody needs -- you do not need an alert on your phone.  GUTFELD: I didn't -- I didn't say I hated your sound. Why do you have to say you hated my sound.  PERINO: Because you don't hate uncorking of wine bottle.  GUTFELD: Well, no, I'm not. But now I do.  HEGSETH: You're talking about the --  GUTFELD: Yes, I love that. I love -- I love any kind of technical sounds.  PERINO: You're good at sounds. Guys -- boys are always good at sounds.  GUTFELD: You know that ASMR kind of stuff.  COMPAGNO: No.  GUTFELD: All right, nevermind.  WILLIAMS: You know, just kind of think of it. You know, the typewriter. When people had really manual typewriters, and they were good. That's a good sound.  GUTFELD: Yes. They sounded great.  PERINO: You have one. You never told me anything about it.  GUTFELD: Oh, it's great. Yes, it's great. I love it.  HEGSETH: Do you drive a lot, Greg?  GUTFELD: Not lately. But we'll get to that later. All right. LMTURN1 says, what's the coolest thing you own? Juan?  WILLIAMS: Well, I can think -- I like -- I was in South Africa when Mandela was released from prison. And I was with him and he signed the front page of the newspaper that day from Soweto. So, the Sowetan.  GUTFELD: Oh, that's nice.  WILLIAMS: And then the other thing I had this interesting is I have a baseball with a picture of Abe Lincoln imprinted on it. You know, 16th President of the United States and it's signed by Barack Obama.  GUTFELD: I thought you're going to say it was Abe Lincoln.  WILLIAMS: Yes, he's an old friend.  GUTFELD: Barack Obama, I mean, OK, but Abe -- do they -- do they have baseball -- they probably didn't have baseball back then. I don't know. Emily, what is the coolest thing you own? I know you're going to say it.  COMPAGNO: Yes. I mean, it is by far my 1972 Mach One.  GUTFELD: Yes, there you go.  COMPAGNO: Right?  GUTFELD: Cars are the greatest.  COMPAGNO: They are.  GUTFELD: They're the greatest. Pete.  HEGSETH: It used to be my Jose Canseco rookie card. But that has dropped in value substantially over the years. Now it's AR-15.  GUTFELD: Nice. AR-15. All right, Dana, do you have an AR-15?  PERINO: I don't. But I do have Nash Metropolitan.  GUTFELD: Yes. Is that your favorite thing now?  PERINO: No. My favorite thing -- that's Peter's favorite. My favorite thing is the painting of Jasper as a puppy that 43 did. That's my very favorite thing.  GUTFELD: That's pretty good. I'm going to have to go with the car, the Facel Vega.  COMPAGNO: The Vega, yes.  GUTFELD: But nobody knows what that thing is.  PERINO: Nobody has seen it in 20 years.  GUTFELD: Nobody has seen it. But I still think about it from time to time. I dream. Oh, I'm on T.V. All right, what is something that everyone looks stupid doing? Dana?  PERINO: Oh my.  GUTFELD: Oh wait, I skipped -- I skipped a question.  PERINO: That's a good one though.  GUTFELD: All right, let's do that one. I skipped the --  PERINO: I would have to say, changing the sheets on the bed.  GUTFELD: Oh, that's a good one.  WILLIAMS: Wait, why was that?  PERINO: Because you always get it wrong.  GUTFELD: It's hard. It's hard. By the way, the worst thing is when you do the fitted thing and it goes here and the other one pops over and hits you in the face. And then you try and you go --  PERINO: And Peter and I always have it going the wrong way the first time always.  COMPAGNO: Totally. Blowing their nose.  GUTFELD: Oh, yes, that's true. It never looks good.  COMPAGNO: That's the end part of it. They're like --  WILLIAMS: An end part?  GUTFELD: And you instinctively look.  COMPAGNO: Oh, God. I want to throw up. I can't.  HEGSETH: When you get the trace residue.  COMPAGNO: No, I can't. I shouldn't have brought this up.  GUTFELD: The trace residue? Is that a weatherman? Trace residue with the news. The nose news. You got a 60 percent chance of boogers.  HEGSETH: It's true though. You never get a clean blowing of your nose.  WILLIAMS: Oh stop. Please stop.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: All right. All right.  GUTFELD: Number one. I'm talking about number three. I don't know. Juan.  WILLIAMS: Well, we just stick with the theme. How about -- how about sticking that Q-tip in your ear. T That looks pretty stupid.  PERINO: Wait. That's not stupid things.  GUTFELD: No, those are private -- I mean, it's something that you see --  WILLIAMS: You see --  HEGSETH: I think guys --  PERINO: Like when you trip and fall.  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: Nobody looks good doing that.  COMPAGNO: Dance, dance --  GUTFELD: I was going to say dancing in general.  HEGSETH: I would say large men also doing yoga.  GUTFELD: Yes, that's good.  HEGSETH: There's no way to make that look good.  GUTFELD: Stretching in general. Everybody knows that nobody needs to stretch. It's an illusion.  PERINO: That's not true.  GUTFELD: No, it is. Science bears it out. Science, whose buddy of mine says that don't stretch. He's also my dealer.  COMPAGNO: People say running at the airport.  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: Oh, running at the airport. Winner, winner.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: You're not supposed -- anytime it looks like you care too much about something. ""ONE MORE THING"" --  COMPAGNO: Oh my God.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WILLIAMS: It's time now for ""ONE MORE THING"" on this Friday. Dana?  PERINO: All right, so you may have noticed that everyone at Fox except for Greg is wearing red today for the American Heart Association's Go Red For Women Movement. Now, this is important. Nearly 45 percent of women aged 20 and over are living with some form of heart disease. And women's symptoms are different from men's. And you should really go to wearredday.org just to check it out and understand.  And also, Valentine's Day is right around the corner, gentlemen, next Friday the 14th. And you can get some new Fox gear. All items at the Fox store are 15 percent off.  GUTFELD: Are you kidding?  PERINO: Yes, get that for Elena.  GUTFELD: Yes, she'll love it.  PERINO: You can get Animals Are Great collars and leashes. You can get Fox News jackets, mugs, hats, even socks. Oh, that looks good on you, Pete.  HEGSETH: You like that?  PERINO: Yes.  GUTFELD: I think that's probably the most romantic gift you give to her.  PERINO: What you do, you go to shop.foxnews.com.  HEGSETH: It depends on the relationship, Greg.  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: I mean, I think they're pretty good.  COMPAGNO: I love that red hat.  PERINO: Yes, the red had.  WILLIAMS: Yes. That's the one I like.  COMPAGNO: I love everything.  WILLIAMS: All right.  PERINO: Here you go, Juan.  GUTFELD: Red, red.  WILLIAMS: Thank you. Thank you. All right, I'm going to go now. Do you know jokes about pizza are not funny? Why? Because they're cheesy and dangerous. Why dangerous? Well, apparently, a lot of people get hurt eating pizza. People going to the hospital after an accident involving pizza jump 50 percent in 2018. Some people fell while carrying the pizza upstairs. Others cut themselves with pizza knives.  COMPAGNO: What?  WILLIAMS: One 17-year-old stuck a fork on the roof of his mouth while he was eating pizza.  COMPAGNO: OK --  WILLIAMS: And a young woman swallowed her tongue ring eating a slice.  GUTFELD: Well, that's on the tongue ring.  WILLIAMS: OK. National pizza day is Sunday. Sunday is pizza -- National Pizza Day. So if you're going to have some pizza this weekend, be careful.  PERINO: National Pizza Day?  GUTFELD: Everything has a day now.  WILLIAMS: Yes.  GUTFELD: Too many -- we don't -- we don't need another day.  HEGSETH: Greg, we celebrate everyone on ""FOX & FRIENDS WEEKEND.""  COMPAGNO: You're going to get all that pizza on Sunday.  HEGSETH: Tune in on Sunday. We'll have pizza all morning long.  WILLIAMS: All right, Greg, you're up.  GUTFELD: All right. Oh, let's do the ""GREG GUTFELD SHOW"" tomorrow night at 10:00 p.m. I got Rob Long. I got Dagen McDowell, Kat Timpf, Tyrus. This is going to be the biggest victory lap ever, and it's going to be great. And then -- but at 8:00, Jesse Watters. And who does he have? The guy, Steve Bannon 8:00 p.m. Eastern. Watters, you owe me for doing this plug.  All right, and then let's do this. Greg's diet tips. You know, the thing about strawberries, they're high in copper, vitamin C, Vitamin E. They're fibrous, Dana.  WILLIAMS: Dana.  GUTFELD: But look at this little fella. He's never seen one before. That's -- I think that's called --  PERINO: Lemur?  GUTFELD: A bushbaby. It's a bushbaby. But look, he's never seen one. He doesn't know what to do. Isn't that kind of adorable? Look at how he stands on his hind legs. That's a lot like me.  COMPAGNO: I don't know.  GUTFELD: Trying to get a drink at a bar.  PERINO: Is he going to eat it?  GUTFELD: You know what?  PERINO: I like how he can turn his head like that.  GUTFELD: Every time he hops, I get a little warm -- a little warmer inside.  PERINO: You tingled down on your leg.  GUTFELD: You tingled down on my leg. Isn't that great though?  PERINO: A tingle down on your leg would not be good.  GUTFELD: Yes. Believe me, I know that feeling too.  GUTFELD: Is that a tough call between dietary tips and animals are great?  GUTFELD: Yes. You know why? Because I know a lot -- when I do the animals are great thing, the audience doesn't see all of these people cringing. They hate the sound -- the song.  HEGSETH: I love it.  GUTFELD: Yes, because you --  HEGSETH: I'm not just --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: You're a patriot. Pete, you're a patriot.  PERINO: You're a patriot, oh god.  GUTFELD: Dana is a communist. That's why she's wearing.  PERINO: Why are you not wearing red? Why are you not wearing red?  WILLIAMS: All right. Be nice, be nice to each other. It's the weekend. Pete, you're up.  HEGSETH: Speaking of the weekend. So I've had some interesting stand-up assignments on ""FOX AND FRIENDS over the years. But check this out. 9 Australia reporter, her name is Sarah Cawte doing a hit with a snake around her neck. Watch.  PERINO: No, no, no, no, no. No, I watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SARAH CAWTE, REPORTER, 9 AUSTRALIA: He just bit my microphone.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just stay still.  CAWTE: He's biting my microphone. What do I do?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You'll be all right. It's just the mic that he's seeing.  CAWTE: But what if he sees my hand?  (END VIDEO CLIP)  HEGSETH: That's just before the hit. She goes on to give a report while the snakes still wrapped around her neck.  GUTFELD: But she is wearing red, Dana.  PERINO: Well, I mean, she's participating.  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: And she even did it for two days because it was like you know --  WILLIAMS: Was that snake poisonous?  HEGSETH: I don't -- I did not do enough research to find out.  PERINO: You are good at ""ONE MORE THING."" That's how we do it.  WILLIAMS: All right, all right, Emily, you're up.  COMPAGNO: That is like -- well, I would never do that.  WILLIAMS: Go, Emily, go.  COMPAGNO: OK. All right, first, happy birthday, Johnny. We love you, vital member of the team. Secondly, best ""ONE MORE THING"" of all time. Check out this dog who lives in Seattle and he rides the bus by himself every day. His name is Eclipse. He's a mastador.  And basically what happened was one day him and -- him and his owner were waiting for the bus and the owner took too long getting on the bus, so the dog gets on the bus, doors closed, and he gets off at the dog park, and he now does it all by himself every day. And that -- what you see on his collar is the little like -- what's it called, bus card -- that he takes and everyone knows him. Eclipse, he's the celebrity Seattle adorable dog.  PERINO: That's so cute.  COMPAGNO: Look how cute he is.  GUTFELD: I don't believe it.  HEGSETH: I bet they have an ordinance. That should not be allowed.  GUTFELD: I think that's a man in a suit.  COMPAGNO: You guys --  GUTFELD: It's a little man in a suit, Emily.  COMPAGNO: No.  GUTFELD: You were taken again.  COMPAGNO: Nope. You're just jealous because it looks cuter than your little owl --  WILLIAMS: What if -- what if people aren't comfortable with a dog?  COMPAGNO: Dude, I get on the bus -- no --  WILLIAMS: All right, set your DVRs. Never miss an episode of THE FIVE.  Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

85,FOX,"Trump strikes back at opponents during White House speech; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" February 6, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Some would even argue we've never seen it before. ""The Five"" starts right now.  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everyone. I am Dana Perino, along with Emily Compagno, Juan Williams, Lawrence Jones, and Greg Gutfeld. It is 5:00 in New York City, and this is THE FIVE. President Trump has been acquitted, but the fight over impeachment appears far from over, a triumphant Trump taking a major victory lap at the National Prayer Breakfast this morning, holding up an acquitted newspaper headline and attacking his political foes.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I don't like people who use their faith as justification for doing what they know is wrong, nor do I like people who say I pray for you when they know that that's not so.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: Nancy Pelosi responding with these harsh words.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): I pray hard for him because he is so off the track of our Constitution, our values, our country. He's talking about things that he knows little about, faith and prayer. He is impeached forever, no matter what he says or whatever headlines he wants to carry around.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: Pelosi also taking direct aim at the president's state of the union speech, which she tore up.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  PELOSI: To me, like -- a little fixated being last year, too. And what happened instead was the president using the Congress of the United States as a backdrop for a reality show. I tore up a manifesto of mistruths. And I don't need any lessons from anybody, especially a president of the United States, about dignity. Next year, we will have a new president of the United States. It's an absolute imperative for our country.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: Then this afternoon, the president going off on impeachment, Pelosi, and much more.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: We were treated unbelievably unfairly. And you have to understand, we first went through Russia, Russia, Russia. It was all bull -- Adam Schiff is a vicious, horrible person. Nancy Pelosi is a horrible person. And she wanted to impeach a long time ago, and she said I pray for the president. I pray for the pre -- she didn't pray. She may pray but she prays for the opposite.  They brought me to the final stages of impeachment. But now, we have that gorgeous word. I never thought a word with sound so good. It's called total acquittal.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: All right, Emily, total acquittal. You heard it.  EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS HOST: This was funny because he said -- look, think what resonates with me so strongly here is the small world that Pelosi is living in that she truly doesn't see that this entire time what's resonated with this president and for the American people is the fact that the entire time he has aligned himself with them, with you, and me.  He's never badmouthed or criticized the public or an entire segment of the population, which is why the Democrats continue to shoot themselves in the foot and continue to seem so out of touch. And it's also why the American people took such offense at her ripping up that speech because it was ripping up them. It was ripping up names and policies and help and identification and a feeling of being heard that this president has done this entire time.  And, you know, we've sat through two years of Mueller and then six months of impeachment. And the Democrats have tried to sell the American people what they say that Trump did, what they said he did. And no one wants to go off that ledge anymore. We have been sold a bombshell over and over again. Who wants to take another leap of faith?  Everyone is exhausted. And to see her perpetuating that same self-lie in that same echo chamber, there's nothing to show for it, except our fatigue, and the fact that she's not going to be speaker next time around.  PERINO: Greg, the speaker is having what you would call a no-good, very bad week.  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Yes. I don't know if it can get any worse but it probably could. I have a piece advice for these people. If you want to get Trump out of the White House, here is an easy strategy. Wait five years, OK? That's all you have to do. I know people are all upset about the presser, but he deserves do -- I would've been worse. I mean, three years.  PERINO: There's no doubt. You would've been so --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: I -- at least he thanked everybody. I would've just been screaming my head -- I would be using much, much worse language.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: I thought the presser was hilarious. I thought it was great. He was right to say everything. But I'm aware that there will be people, like Juan, who disagree completely and people out there. So there is one side that feels really bad about this and one side that's ecstatic. So we can agree that the both sides are looking at the same thing and seeing two different things, right?  So what's the answer? Which side is best at predicting the outcomes? So when you have these two different visions, what predicted the implosion of collusion or the obstruction or Kavanaugh, impeachment? It's the people who were happy today, right? That side has been able to predict, with almost 100 percent certainty, what was going to happen.  And the other side, which is so emotionally damaged, that's damaged because every time their side is wrong because of their cognitive dissonance, they cannot understand why the vision in their head isn't matching the reality outside. And so you have these people -- Nancy did not look like -- she looked like she had had it.  And I think for reasons that had nothing to do with Trump. But her own side has not helped her. Every time that they predict something, it's bad and it bleeds into Iowa. They get everything wrong, should learn something.  PERINO: January was like Iran, impeachment. Then they have Iowa. It is like the ides of February, Juan. What's going on? What do you think about the speaker's response today?  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: I think she was right. I mean, look, I just couldn't believe what the president did in the East Room. I mean, obviously, we just played him using profanity. I just don't think it's me when I see a president behave like that. And, you know, I think this is inappropriate and wrong. I think most Americans, by the way, would agree with me.  I don't think it's that he's in touch with Americans. I think he did a power play. And there were a lot of spineless Republicans in the Senate who just couldn't deal with a matter of conscience. And when it comes to religion, which was so central, by the way, in the way that Mitt Romney --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: -- hang on. Yes, what Romney did and what Nancy Pelosi did would say this is appalling behavior. And they, therefore, acted in accordance with their conscience and with their faith as what Mitt Romney said.  GUTFELD: It's inconvenient.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: -- in other words, and then the president speaks to this religion angle today, Dana. But, of course, he behaved inappropriately at the prayer breakfast. This guy --  (CROSSTALK)  LAWRENCE JONES, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: -- when he said she was sedated.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: -- this guy doesn't know anything about religion. He doesn't know anything about forgiveness, about humility. No, he doesn't. He doesn't live his life that way. He says he doesn't forgive people. Greg, you said don't judge words, judge by actions. Look at his actions.  GUTFELD: Yes, and now he's acquitted. That's a great action.  WILLIAMS: This guy does not live like Jesus. This is not a Christian life.  PERINO: All right. Let's get Lawrence.  JONES: Here's the deal. For years, we've heard the Democrats say that Nancy Pelosi was the adult in the room. She doesn't do name-calling. She called the president sedated today. She's classy. She's about decorum. In the House, she ripped up his speech. And so the Democrats can no longer claim that they have the moral high ground.  And what I've been telling people for years is that the way Trump behaves is much like many of the people that are in the House. Many of the other leaders, they just do it behind closed doors. The difference from Trump is, he is who he is, and this was a day of celebration because not only was it about him. They destroyed this man's family, went after everyone in the cabinet, went after every business associate.  They used political pressure in the prosecution to squeeze people on false charges that had nothing to do with collusion. They destroyed everyone that was associated with the president. So, of course --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: So he just gets away with lying?  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Oh, he just lies in the state of the union. He tells outright lies about healthcare. Oh, I am protecting people with pre-existing conditions.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Don't a say word.  JONES: -- Democrats on pre-existing conditions. But again, you all didn't want to stand up for the kids, with school choice. You all didn't want to stand for the Tuskegee airmen.  (CROSSTALK)  JONES: -- essentially more people being on food stamps.  WILLIAMS: You know what I liked about that speech -- the state of the union, it was reality TV with a TV performance, but it was insulting to the House, because you don't give Rush Limbaugh a Medal of Freedom. The first lady put it. It was just like a sideshow.  (CROSSTALK)  JONES: Democrats would think their strategy as the president is rising in approval rating or they're still going to take this and say you all trying to impeach him. You all tried for the Russian conspiracy. And it still didn't work. His approval rating is going up.  PERINO: All right. We've got to go.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: Believe me. Greg will take a look at some of the most the most over-the-top reactions to impeachment, not including the one you just saw.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: The consequence of a delusion, the breakdown that follows after truth is revealed.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Slash his throat, every effen Republican. Slash Republicans' throats. Slash fascist throats, death to fascists.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: That person is going to do well in life. Imagine being his parents. I would make a joke but I feel sorry for them. It's a break down. What you also see on social media where celebrities resort to, all caps, insanity in response to cheeky memes. Remember this one? Trump just reposted it, prompting Bette Midler to scream frantically.  You think this is a joke, don't you? It's not. He means it. He will change the rules. And his enablers will let him. If he wins again, he will rule until you until he dies. You die or both then you get Ivanka if you're lucky. Of course, that's a joke but maybe not. At least Ivanka is sane. Midler is so nutty. Elephants keep trying to eat her. Meanwhile, after Trump's presser, CNN goes full Freudian.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This was a very disturbing tableau for the country. It was dark because he's made clear that his mind is dark. This is somebody in deep psychological distress right now, self-pity, insecure, angry.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: That is a straight news reporter.  PERINO: Right.  GUTFELD: Once again, CNN's very best become psychiatrists, diagnosing mental illness. No surprise Harwood a paranoid narcoleptic who eats his own hair. I'm kidding. But see, anyone can play doctor, especially in times of hysteria when you see someone else's good time is your bad. Emotion fuels the anger. The media gins it up for ratings, making the hangover worse once the fantasy collapses.  It happened before, righteous rage followed by depression. And it'll happen again. But remember, the media and the Dems resorted to similar attacks on Reagan, Bush, McCain, Bourque (ph), and yes even poor Mitt, the dog abuser. But the attacks on Trump are more plentiful and more intense. Why is that, because he fought back?  Remember when people mocked Trump defenders who would say but he fights. Hell, they were right. It's why he's winning and why the other side keeps screaming. Dana, I have a theory that you should only tweet in all caps if your house is on fire, and then you shouldn't even be on Twitter.  PERINO: Yes. Like, for people that are on Twitter a lot, they think that they're having an impact, but it really is, like, they are just talking to themselves. It's like spitting in the wind.  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: And it goes away so quickly so it's kind of pointless.  GUTFELD: That's rude, spitting in the wind, Dana.  PERINO: Well, if you spit in the wind, sometimes it comes back and hits you in the face.  GUTFELD: Exactly. It's an apt analogy for the Democrats.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: The other thing -- like Bernie fights.  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: Right?  GUTFELD: Bernie fights, exactly.  PERINO: He's not going to take these Iowa results lying down.  GUTFELD: I take a lot of things lying down, Lawrence, because I'm lazy. Let me ask you this. Did you see that -- what did you think of that video of that kid? Isn't that the creepiest thing? I thought it was funny, and I they look at it. I go there's -- what is wrong with these people in college?  JONES: Well, I covered college for two years on campus reform, and this is typical behavior. These people -- and it is part of the professors' fall as well, because, you know, we think the other side just have -- I think Juan has bad ideas but I love Juan. We go. We have a drink and everything. They're being talked -- that the other side on college campuses are evil.  GUTFELD: Yes.  JONES: That they're a threat to Democracy, that they're a threat to the country. And when you have these developing minds that should be learning both sides of the political spectrum, and you put that nonsense in their head, they just start reacting like that.  GUTFELD: You know, Juan --  (CROSSTALK)  JONES: -- we don't know.  GUTFELD: Yes. I heard that that kid, Juan, is actually now getting a job at CNN as a media reporter.  WILLIAMS: Could be, or maybe he'll replace you, I don't know. It seems to me, though, that -- I mean it's crazy to extrapolate from -- that's just bad behavior, and clearly threatening. I would -- if the police are aware of it, they should be checking him out.  GUTFELD: Yes.  WILLIAMS: Drugs maybe an issue. But you can't extrapolate and say that's typical behavior on college campuses.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: If you took an example of a right-winger saying something crazy and said all Republicans are all conservatives, we would say no, that's not fair.  GUTFELD: -- a trend, Juan. I have three examples.  WILLIAMS: Yes. So to me, the big news here it seems to me, look, trump and people who are upset, and I think lots of Democrats are upset at the idea that there was a power play that was devoid of paying attention to what was going on that you had Republicans who say he did something wrong, but we don't want to impeach him. It's like people just are lacking in saying conviction and holding to the promise to uphold the Constitution.  GUTFELD: All right. It's over, Juan. We've got to move on to the next step in this, which is the next impeachment. Emily, the thing that drives me crazy is the diagnosis, when people diagnose people's problems. I mean, doctors aren't allowed to do that without seeing a patient. But Harwood is?  COMPAGNO: I agree. Also, that video of that guy is that's my entire metaphor for the Democratic Party right now, which is that the Democratic Party leadership are screaming in the middle of their echo chamber. They are fueled entirely by emotion and contempt. And that's one of the Four Horsemen, right? Remember this.  John Gottman saying once you have contempt, like, the whole world is over. There's no -- you can't proceed with logic anymore. And meanwhile, while this guy is, like, literally going crazy, screaming at what he thinks is so true. All around him is everyone -- I've got to get to class in about 20 minutes. I'm videotaping this insane guy.  Like, what am I having for dinner? I've got to do this. Because meanwhile, we have these statistics that came that was covered in the state of the union. I mean, the DOW has been up almost 60 percent since the election, S&P almost 56 percent, 90 percent of Americans are satisfied with their personal life. These are things that matter.  So literally, the rest of the party watching the leadership in the middle go beside themselves and make no production whatsoever. And at the end of the day, we are going to learn at the ballot box who made the most sense to them. It's not Pelosi.  WILLIAMS: Yes. Well, let me just tell you. It's like -- what is it, 80 percent of Americans are represented by the senators who voted to convict and remove this president.  GUTFELD: Well, you know, it didn't work out. Coming up, bitter Democrats claim Trump wasn't really acquitted, plus, the media's new love affair with Mr. Mitt Romney.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WILLIAMS: The post impeachment political battle rages on, and some Democrats say President Trump was not truly acquitted. Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This vote is no vindication. It's no real acquittal. It's no victory.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: am uncomfortable with the word acquitted because that implies that there was a full and fair trial.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, but there's no vindication from a rigged trial.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's a giant asterisk next to the president's acquittal. (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: And Senator Mitt Romney, he's being praised for voting to convict President Trump on the abuse of power article of impeachment.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: God bless him for his courage.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It will cement Senator Romney's legacy.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I do want to salute Mitt Romney.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This was a profile in courage.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I was listening to a decent and honorable man who stood up and did the right thing.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He is now the president of the Republican resistance to Donald Trump.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It was something that I've never actually seen since I've been in the Senate.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: I guess they are saying that he voted as an act of conscience, Lawrence, and that, you know, it's a fact he was the one who stood up. I think I read today that in all the prior impeachments, the president who was being impeached was able to hold his party in line. So this is the first historically. But I think lots of Republicans saying, oh, it's just Democrats celebrating Romney. What do you think?  JONES: Well, it's clear, because he was the devil before, you know -- all this nonsense. You only have courage when you stand with the Democrats. That's apparently they have defined it as. Courage is when you decide to vote against the president. Look, on a sad note, though, this is bad for the Democrats. It is bitterness, and they can't move forward.  The game is over. He has been acquitted. That's it. You move on. You try to beat him in the next election. Instead, because they have no message, the party is in disarray. They don't know how to control the progressive wing. And I think this is not going to even be a competition when it comes to November. It won't be a competition, because they have no message.  They have no leadership right now, can't even run Iowa, right? But they are still worried about the president, impeachment, and so forth.  WILLIAMS: By the way, Dana, did you think that -- I saw that Mitt Romney did several interviews before he actually voted. Do you think he was trying to defend his legacy? How do you interpret what happened here?  PERINO: Well, I asked Mike Lee today who's on the daily briefing if -- because he is the other senator from Utah, if he had talked to Mr. Romney before, and the answer was no. But they -- I think he knew that the blowback was coming. He knew that he was going to be called a traitor. He knew people that people were going to mock his religion and say that he's just a faker.  So I think he knew all of that. So he is savvy enough to know, like, he lost the presidential election when Obama was up for re-election. And so he knew what the media attacks were going to be. But a couple of things, on the Democrats saying that he's not acquitted, do they now think that the media is fake news, because all of the headline say acquittal.  So it is acquittal. And I think that the spin that it's not really acquittal, that might work in some fundraising but it's not going to work at the ballot box for sure. Plus, don't forget it was Harry Reid, the senator -- when he was the majority leader, who suggested that Mitt Romney never paid taxes. And all these people who are praising Mitt Romney now did nothing to stand up and say that was wrong.  And even when Harry Reid later on was like I was just lying, but that's cool, right? All of them are, like, that's fine. You can do that to people and that's fine. Mitt Romney knows he's going to be lonely. And he will be eating alone at the lunch table. And I think he's accepted that.  WILLIAMS: It's funny. I remember that when Mitt Romney was nominated, you had Republicans speak so highly of him as a man of family, a man of faith, for example.  PERINO: Yes, of course.  WILLIAMS: And then in the last week, I've seen Republicans, conservatives just absolutely skewer him alive, Greg.  GUTFELD: Are you telling me that politics is a team sport thing that you end up supporting the person that is leaving the party?  WILLIAMS: No, but I'm saying that Republicans are now attacking and libeling Romney who once praised him --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: You know I don't have a problem. Mitt can do whatever he wants. And I think the Democrats need him. It's like, you know, how people have therapy animals after a really traumatic event. You know, is their therapy weasel. And they are clinging to him. At least we have Mitt, it's OK. You can have Mitt. I don't care. But I don't need anybody to lecture me on lack of character or a lack of conscience as though he's somehow the epitome of that.  Please, don't do that to me. I don't need that. Here's the deal. We have two different men, Mitt and Trump, they're vastly different. The Dems would have preferred to have Mitt because he doesn't fight, all right, but Trump does. So this is how the argument is always going to be. Mitt, he is the nice guy who loses. Trump's the animal who wins. And that upsets people. I don't care. I really don't.  WILLIAMS: I remember you did care when Trump insulted John McCain.  GUTFELD: And I have been through this. And I wrote a book on it. And I said that once he got elected and he became my president, I'd give him a chance.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: You gave him a pass or a chance?  GUTFELD: Did you hear me?  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: I think you might just given him a pass.  GUTFELD: You know what? You're screwed up in the brain, Juan. I said chance.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: When you said you give them a chance --  GUTFELD: Look at his deeds and not his words. I said this so many times --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Do you sleep at this table?  WILLIAMS: But I'm saying, well, his deeds don't seem to support the idea that, oh yes, he's doing great.  GUTFELD: Look at the economy. Look at peace, look at prosperity.  WILLIAMS: Oh, my gosh.  GUTFELD: Oh my God, Juan. Yes, those are called deeds.  WILLIAMS: Look at --  GUTFELD: If you want to get mad about his words, you've been doing it for three years.  WILLIAMS: No, I'm saying, look at his deeds. I think --  GUTFELD: It gets you nowhere.  WILLIAMS: Has he delivered on the wall? Wait, has he delivered on wall? Has he done something about healthcare?  GUTFELD: Well, so far the wall is coming.  WILLIAMS: Our troops -- are we sending more troops to the Middle East? All right, so Emily.  COMPAGNO: So on Mitt, what's interesting is that you know, when he ran for president, those ads, the DNC ads, you guys remember those? Like Paul Ryan pushing the grandma off a cliff and big bird, and he was absolutely vilified. So it's a little difficult to take with any credibility or honesty. These people who are now championing him were the same people that say, Look, you're innocent until proven guilty.  I thought Senator Scott had an incredible comment today, which is that look, you know, we thought through 60 hours of testimony and 190 video clips and 13 witnesses, and look, if you started out with the presumption of innocence, then 100 percent there was an acquittal. But if you started out with a presumption and a self-conviction of guilt, then no wonder that you came to that guilt conclusion.  And really quickly on Hunter, because I think this is important and will probably be circling back to this. The Treasury Department has complied -- has complied with the Republican senators request for that the highly sensitive financial documents, right, for Hunter and his associates. And we have now a leading Democrat on the committee who's saying, we'll, the origins of the evidence are highly questionable.  And I just have to throw out there that, you know, the entire FISA court, the entire surveillance warrants, everything was based on evidence of questionable origin and no one cared about it back then. So I find it curious that automatically and already Democrats on the Hill are carrying about questionable origin of evidence when it comes to Hunter Biden.  WILLIAMS: All right, if you thought what's going on with the Iowa caucuses is bad, wait until you hear what just happened. It's unbelievable, but it's next for you on THE FIVE.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  JONES: The DNC has said enough is enough with the disaster, that is the Iowa caucuses. Chairman Tom Perez is calling for an immediate re-candidacy. Even though we don't know who the -- who won the caucus yet, Bernie Sanders is declaring victory over Mayor Pete. And after his embarrassing showing in the Hawkeye State, Joe Biden is getting in the gutter to attack the new front runners.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: But if Senator Sanders is a nominee for the party, every Democrat in America up and down the ballot, blue states, red states, purple states will have to carry the label Senator Sanders has chosen for himself, Democratic Socialist. It's a risk, to be just straight up with you, for this party to nominate someone who's never held an office higher than mayor of a town of 100,000 people in Indiana.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  JONES: But Bernie and Mayor Pete are fighting back against Biden's attacks.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Let me tell my good friend, Joe, that when we're dealing with somebody like Donald Trump, he will pin any label that he wants on any candidate.  PETE BUTTIGIEG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If that argument is about electability and the ability to win, we just had the first election of the 2020 process and I think that's my answer.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  JONES: Wow. Dana, are you surprised that it took this long for them to actually fight?  PERINO: You know, I've been waiting for it for a long time because if you remember the 2015, beginning of that Republican Primary, that was a fight from the beginning, and it does never ended, and then it ultimately ended in the victory of President Trump.  For these guys, if Buttigieg is at 26.2 percent, Sanders at 26.1 percent, that is so close. And you can imagine that you might call for a recount, right? But I believe that Tom Perez, the head of the DNC, was trying to get ahead of the candidates. And he was calling for a recap and seeing -- which is a recount. That doesn't mean you have to go back and re caucus, it's just a recount because all the candidates are going to do it themselves.  Remember, the candidates had all their people keeping track as well, so they know. That's why I think Bernie Sanders feels very confident saying that he won. But I've also heard there's a lot of irregularities that came in. There's how many, is it 1,600 counties, Juan, or something, precincts? Just -- it's a lot to redo. And the Democrats desperately need some clarity as to where the party wants to go. They did not get it out of Iowa, but they'll get it in about five days in New Hampshire.  WILLIAMS: Well, I mean, you got to be careful here, because it's not Tom Perez's responsibility because it was done by the state party, not the national party. But I think that what you get here is Tom Perez is now trying to assert control. He's trying to say, listen, one of the problems we had that night was you had -- you know, Bret, Martha, and everybody else on the air and nothing being said, nothing explained.  So you had like a vacuum, and then you had conspiracy theories, finger- pointing and Trump celebrating, and jumping oh, the Democrats can't do anything. So I think he wants to take control and say, this is what happened and we're going to put it out, we're going to get this straight.  Now, just to those numbers that you see up on the screen, I'll say Sanders to me did very well. I think Buttigieg outperformed expectations by far, so he did very well. Biden, I think is struggling. And he didn't initially want to compete in Iowa, really didn't think that much about competing in New Hampshire because it's Bernie's home territory.  But what it means now is that he is on edge with regard to not only to Nevada, but South Carolina, and fundraising. He's got to start performing. If he's supposed to be elected, he got to win. By the way, that think Buttigieg said, ridiculous. Buttigieg can't even win a statewide election in Indiana. Joe Biden is senator many times over.  JONES: So Emily, I was down on the ground in Iowa, it was not foreign for me to see that Bernie Sanders did good in this because all the support, all the caucuses that I went to in the polling locations, they were all Bernie people. Should the Democratic Party be concerned that he looks like the new front runner?  COMPAGNO: Well, I think they should they should be concerned and they have been, right? We've been hearing kind of that growing swell of unease about his lead in these states. I think that just kind of jumping around a little bit, that notice all the headlines and the shaping about Sanders' win. Everyone is saying like, well, Buttigieg narrowly -- like it's all things about how -- they're kind of -- they're downplaying the fact that he absolutely soared there.  And I think we can't discount the fact that had that message is resonating, at least with those folks and probably more. I think the most impactful thing coming out of there for Biden was the margin. And you and I talked about this before on your show, the fact that, you know, it matters for donations, for fundraising, not in a myriad aspect with Nevada. But the fact that it matters, that margin from 26 to 15 is a really big deal.  And I can't remember if we talked about this in the beginning of the block, but Hillary Clinton coming from left field and like trying to be V.P. again.  JONES: Actually I think we have that sound. Let's play it for a second. We'll get Greg to react.  GUTFELD: Good transition.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  ELLEN DEGENERES, TV HOST: If someone asks you to be a vice president, would you do it?  HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Well, that's not going to happen. But no, probably no.  DEGENERES: You don't know that's not going to happen.  CLINTON: I think I do, yes.  DEGENERES: Really?  CLINTON: Yes, I think I do.  DEGENERES: All right. But what if they did?  CLINTON: I never say never because I do believe --  DEGENERES: OK, so you're serving my country.  CLINTON: But it's not going to happen.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  COMPAGNO: Yes, she doesn't --  JONES: Greg, What do you think? Well, she's actually -- she's often the distance waiting on a branch, right, overlooking this dusty desert highway, so she could swoop in, when the -- when Biden collapses or when the whole thing goes to hell, and she comes in. And I totally -- I thought she was going to get back in, and I said she wasn't. And my buddy Walter Kerns said, it's going to happen. And I'm beginning to think maybe it's true.  But I agree with Juan over Buttigieg that, you know, Buttigieg hasn't proved anything beyond mayor. However, when you listen to the candidates, he's still the smartest one. It's like you listen to him, and you just go well, yes, he could -- he could handle --  JONES: I think he could just rehearse.  GUTFELD: No, I think he could handle himself better with Trump than Joe. Joe, it's like I don't know. That's the way -- he had the -- start the new coke. You know, he's out in the parking lot shouting at clouds.  WILLIAMS: You know -- you know, one of the things that I think these days is we are in a culture war as -- and this culture now precedes politics in terms of policy.  GUTFELD: Yes, I agree.  WILLIAMS: If the Democrats are going to beat Trump, they got to start playing in terms of the culture war. So Greg, with -- who -- which of the Democrats do you think would be best against Trump?  GUTFELD: Well, geez, I would go -- right now I'm going to have to go with Buttigieg.  WILLIAMS: Really?  GUTFELD: Because I just think that he is the most articulate and persuasive of the group, though I do -- I do like Yang.  PERINO: And Democrats like --  JONES: All right, we got to leave it --  PERINO: Democrats do like to move forward generationally.  JONES: All right, we got to leave it there. The ""FASTEST SEVEN"" is back. Don't go anywhere.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  COMPAGNO: Welcome back. Time for the ""FASTEST SEVEN."" First up. PETA now claims that it's derogatory to call animals pets. Instead, owners should say guardians or companion animals.  PERINO: Oh my god.  COMPAGNO: You, who have no pets.  JONES: Wow  GUTFELD: How do you know that? I don't call them pets.  COMPAGNO: Because you always say you hate dogs.  GUTFELD: I don't call them pets. You know what's interesting, ironic? So PETA is a movement that doesn't want to call the animals pets, yet there's a whole another movement, kind of downtown and also in San Francisco, where humans are treated as pets. You can put them on leashes and you can walk them around. Juan, don't act like you don't know it.  WILLIAMS: What are you talking about? Is this sexual stuff?  GUTFELD: Yes.  WILLIAMS: OK, OK, all right, all right.  COMPAGNO: Dana, what do you think?  PERINO: Well, I think it's interesting. Look, PETA is ridiculous. It's called PETA, obviously.  COMPAGNO: Oh, sorry.  GUTFELD: That was very clever.  PERINO: Peter, my husband, Peter, has something similar. When people say, do you own Jasper? And he'll say, well, he's our dog, but he doesn't -- he doesn't like to say that like we own him. Like as a dog owner.  GUTFELD: He owns you.  PERINO: You think that's how it works?  GUTFELD: Jasper owns you.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Back it up.  JONES: This is so much better.  WILLIAMS: Holy smoke.  GUTFELD: Oh my God. That would have gotten water in my face if I said --  PERINO: Well, there would be some reporters who's going to write about this and then you apologize.  COMPAGNO: Lawrence, what about you?  JONES: I just -- I'm so sick of PETA. I mean, it would be one thing if they were focusing on animal rights, making sure they're not abused and making sure -- but now they're dictating people's English. I mean, some people call their pets family.  COMPAGNO: Yes.  JONES: It wouldn't be what I use, but I love them.  COMPAGNO: Any final words?  WILLIAMS: I don't know how to deal with this kind of situation. You know, I think the fact that we're talking about it gets us to think about it as an American people, that we suddenly start thinking about what what's our relationship with the animal that lives with us? That's not a bad thing.  PERINO: OK, you can say it. It's not the Washington Redskins. You can say pet.  WILLIAMS: That's bad. That's bad.  COMPAGNO: All right, next up.  WILLIAMS: But I must say, in terms of history, I remember Charles Krauthammer saying me once. When history looks back at this period, the way that we deal with animals, and eat animals, and put them in --  PERINO: He wasn't talking about pets. Krauthammer love dogs.  WILLIAMS: Oh, no, no.  PERINO: Read the book. He's got a whole column about dogs.  WILLIAMS: In close -- it's the fact of the way we treat animals is not going to be viewed very well.  GUTFELD: Factory farming.  WILLIAMS: Right, there you go.  PERINO: But that's not pets.  GUTFELD: I agree. I know.  WILLIAMS: Animals. It's animals.  COMPAGNO: All right, second topic, just how many bad hair days do Americans have in a year? The answer allegedly is 96. Which works out to about eight per month according to a new survey way. Weigh in if you want to.  PERINO: Well, we're not -- I mean, we shouldn't ask -- we get our hair and makeup done for us.  GUTFELD: I don't.  PERINO: I mean, Lawrence has bad hair days.  JONES: I do. I do. Because --  COMPAGNO: I can't imagine that.  JONES: I do have bad hair days because I'm (INAUDIBLE) about it. Like, I used to get haircuts twice a week.  GUTFELD: Talking about bad hair.  JONES: My hair -- my hair grows incredibly fast. This guy is a mess. And so, yes, I have better hair days all the time.  PERINO: Really?  JONES: I'm having bad hair day right now.  PERINO: No, it's like perfect all the time. What are you talking about.  JONES: I know what my ends up is supposed to be crisp in the line, and the line in my head is supposed to be crisp. So yes.  COMPAGNO: You have them all the time.  JONES: I have bad hair days a couple of times a month, but it's my back. It's interesting. All right, never mind. Anyway, anyway, we're having this discussion and there's probably people at home who are bald who are just going, shut up.  WILLIAMS: Right.  GUTFELD: I would kid everything for a bad hair day.  PERINO: I can't believe you're making fun of bald people. How dare you, Greg.  GUTFELD: By the way, you know, I'm getting older and I having more hair, isn't that bizarre?  PERINO: And it's not even coming out of your ears.  COMPAGNO: All right, finally, President Trump has made the infamous love affair between Peter Strzok and Lisa page a campaign rally staple. He even mentioned it today.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: This is Peter to Lisa. He's probably trying to impress her for obvious reasons. There's no way he gets elected, but I'm afraid we can't take the risk.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  COMPAGNO: Now, this Strzok-Page drama will be performed live at CPAC with Dean Cain and Kristy Swanson reenacting the text messages. Now, Dean Cain, he tweeted about this because he was getting kind of, you know, backlash from the left saying, aren't you just humiliating people and this is for media and laughs. He's said, no, we're doing this to expose the bias of federal investigators trying to unseat a duly elected president.  WILLIAMS: This is ridiculous, you know. I mean, I remember when people at this table said oh, why are celebrities reading the Mueller report? So now the shoes on the other foot and you're celebrating this. Oh my gosh.  GUTFELD: Can I respond to that? Because I want to -- I want to -- you made a point. That was a good point about how now politics is downstream from culture. This is evidence of that because now you're having entertainment go into politics.  JONES: You know what, I really don't care if people get -- made fun of that abuse their powers and target American citizen. I think they should be the laughingstock.  WILLIAMS: Oh, so when Mueller is --  JONES: I'm not talking about Mueller.  WILLIAMS: They should mock --  JONES: These are people that lied to the FISA Court --  WILLIAMS: They didn't lied.  JONES: -- that abused the president. Lisa suppressed evidence.  COMPAGNO: Lisa Page -- Lisa Strzok is if they -- if they legitimize their - - Dana, your thoughts?  PERINO: I don't have anything to say about it.  COMPAGNO: All right, fine, guys. ""ONE MORE THING"" is up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PERINO: Time now for ""ONE MORE THING."" I'm going to go first. Finny Molloy is a golden retriever. He has an affinity for tennis balls and a special talent when it comes to carrying them around. Check him out.

Ahmed Alwan, the son of the store's owner is asking math questions of his customers. If they get it right, they get a mini shopping spree. Ahmed said, his dad isn't worried about giving away too much food or he says it's all going to come out of the son's paycheck. The customer's five-second frenzy has made the store into a real-life version of the old T.V. show (INAUDIBLE).  By the way, here is my favorite winner. He nailed the question and then as you see, he just pulled a row of lottery tickets. Fast thinking.  COMPAGNO: Brilliant.  JONES: I like that.  PERINO: All right, Greg.  GUTFELD: I don't know how I feel about that. It's so weird. But I guess it's good. OK, what am I doing? This. What's with the animal noises?

JONES: You know what I like? A good high five, and so does this little boy right here. This is a three-year-old. He's an Atlanta Hawks fan. And here he is high fiving the entire team that are running on the -- running on the court to play the Boston Celtics. Look at him. And he just has enough.  GUTFELD: He better not have the flu.  JONES: Look at this kid.  PERINO: Wash your hands, everybody.  JONES: He just loves it. I think he's a great member for the team.  PERINO: Kids have germs.  GUTFELD: Kids have germs.

You go into what -- I'm buying something in an alley, and I never go back.  COMPAGNO: Oh my gosh, it's so cute.  JONES: He was waiting for him.  COMPAGNO: Totally. He was like hey --  PERINO: He was like, come on, come on. Because he wants his help.

86,FOX,"Democrats invented a new kind of crazy: Knowing the outcome of an event well in advance and still expecting a different result. This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" February 5, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Hi, I'm Greg Gutfeld, with Katie Pavlich, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and a dragonfly is her jet ski, Dana Perino -- ""The Five."" Well, that's over with for now. So you've heard the definition of crazy, doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. Well, the Democrats invented a new kind of crazy, knowing the outcome of an event well in advance and still expecting a different result. That's impeachment. The worst planned adventure since the Donner Party. The Dems blew all their energy on a losers bet, one that made the Iowa mess possible. Instead of wowing America, they fell flat on their faces because they were distracted. A return to Greg's Rule, Republicans run things, Democrats ruin them. The difference is one letter, which stands for impeachment. So once again, the losers return to their hallucinations. The snakes on the wall, they're real if you are Adam Schiff, because now Trump could offer Alaska to the Russians. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trump could offer Alaska to the Russians in exchange for support in the next election. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Adam is so nutty he farts trail mix. But it beats moving to Mar- A-Lago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Or decide to move to Mar-A-Lago permanently and let Jared Kushner run the country. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: So why claim to these crazy predictions? Because they don't exist, which means you can't disprove them. And the response will always be, well, you just wait. They are like imaginary mice and Schiff's the crazy cook on the table screaming. But those mad ravings had us waiting for the stock market crash, a tyranny, World War III, IV, and V, all paranoid nightmares that never came. Instead, all we got were stock market highs, trade deals, dead tariffs, and jobs. And since those successes are under Trump, the delusions only deepen. Without a real vision beyond anger, they cling to these mental phantoms. Look, early on, we told the Dems impeachment was a dead fish. We said don't follow Adam. He is selling you drugs that only end in bad trips. But did they listen? Nope. To them, bad drugs are better than no drugs, which is why they will be back at the lab coming up with a new paranoia pill. But we know not to gulp them. Let them have them all, because we saw it coming, but they have it coming. All right, where to start, Jesse, big fat waste of time. The only winner in this whole thing, us. The network is pulling in millions of eyeballs. God knows what the ad money is. JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST: It's a lot. GUTFELD: My second home is buying a third home. WATTERS: And I don't even have a second home. GUTFELD: I have a fourth home on top of my third home. WATTERS: OK, I mean, stop bragging, damn it. I'm really jealous. GUTFELD: My sixth home is dating my seventh home. WATTERS: OK. When I am your age, maybe I will have a second home. DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Oh, very good. WATTERS: Juan, when I got on the set, you asked me are you pumped. And I said about what? And you said about the acquittal. And I thought to myself we knew this was going to happen. This is like when your wife or your husband makes you go out to dinner to another couple's house who you hate. You have to go. GUTFELD: Right. WATTERS: Their food is terrible. You know you're going to have a bad time. Eventually, it's going to be over and you're going to be back in bed and you're going to say I told you, honey. PERINO: Was that the one at my House? WATTERS: Yes, it was. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: He's talking about the queso night. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: And then just to say something, to have a Trump impeachment, and you don't have any sex. You don't even have a dead body. You don't have a suitcase full of cash in the freezer. This is the lamest impeachment ever. Also, to your point about what you said in the monologue, these crazy predictions. It's the same thing with global warming. In 20 years, Miami is going to be underwater. And if you say I don't think that is possible. They say, oh, you've got to believe me. And by the way, you got to give me all your money. That's the same thing. It's a stickup scam. I didn't fall for it because I told you the whole time what was going to happen. You didn't listen, Juan. Are you happy, Juan? Are you happy because it looks like it backfired? JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Why do you say it backfired? WATTERS: I'm just saying because Biden got damaged. WILLIAMS: Oh, yeah. WATTERS: You're not going to retake the Senate. Trump's at 49 percent approval. And what did we learn? There was a phone call and the transcripts came out. I learned I was right, but I knew that before hand. WILLIAMS: Right. You're always right. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: But I will say I think impeachment led most of the American people now to understand that this is a corrupt president. But they said, in essence, and this was the Republican line. Even if he did it, we don't think it is quite impeachable. Wait until the election, as if the forefathers didn't think about elections. So you have now -- I'm just going to give you a few -- Senator Rubio, Senator Portman, Senator Toomey, Senator Collins, Senator Murkowski, and of course, Senator Romney, who voted to convict. All saying the president did something wrong, embarrassing, inappropriate, all of it. GUTFELD: We saw that trick there, Juan. You just grouped Romney with people who didn't vote to impeach. WILLIAMS: No. I'm just telling you that's what they said. They said that the House managers made a convincing case but were not going to convict. I mean, I think Romney should be honored as a man of principle in this case, because at least he voted with his heart, not about power or avoiding Trump's tweets. I mean, to me, what you get here is this is what Republicans in the Senate say. And then they -- you know what, they just said, you know, boy, we don't want Donald Trump saying nasty things about us. GUTFELD: Yeah. That's good mind-reading. That is what we are all thinking. Katie, what do you think? KATIE PAVLICH, GUEST CO-HOST: Well, I was a little bit surprised at the vote with Joe Manchin. I thought he would maybe vote to acquit the president on at least one of the articles, considering in West Virginia the president is very popular. And it would've been politically safe for him to do so. But he voted with Democrats. This was predicted as a bipartisan acquittal. It did not end up being that way. But there is obviously going to be a lot made of Mitt Romney's vote. I don't think that it really matters, because the president has a 95 percent approval in the GOP. The American people have given him an approval rating at the highest he's seen throughout his presidency. Throughout this trial, Adam Schiff was trying to say that he is going to cheat and steal and that you can't trust the American people to make decisions in the next election. I think people probably took that pretty personally. And so moving forward, I don't think that his vote really matters when it comes to the numbers. And the president has had a lot of wins. And as soon as Mitt Romney does something the Democrats disapprove of, he will no longer be the moral clarity that they are claiming today. And I would like to go back to the election against Barack Obama when they were calling him a racist. They were calling him an animal abuser. And of course, he was waging a war on women. So, you know, maybe some of those people can take back some of the things that they said about him at that point. GUTFELD: Yeah, the women in the binders. PAVLICH: Yeah, the binders full of women. GUTFELD: Dana, what are your thoughts on Democratic fatalism? PERINO: Well, I think that -- partly -- Pelosi -- did you write that down? (CROSSTALK) PERINO: I haven't even read this article yet. The -- it was written by John Ellis, I'm sure it's very good. Nancy Pelosi was also telling them for months don't do this. It's going to backfire. It is not a good idea. And then -- but she did feel pushed by the progressives. GUTFELD: Right. PERINO: And where else do you see being pushed by progressives? Well, you could look at after 2016, what did Bernie Sanders do? He got the DNC to change everything, and how is that working out for them? GUTFELD: Yeah. PERINO: And so I think her frustration last night was not only just at the president but also at her caucus. Looking at them, thinking, you know I told you this was going to happen. And now, they are in a fix. And the president looks like he is just going to waltz right back into the White House for a second term. Obviously, it's not going to be that easy, but right now it feels that way. GUTFELD: Yeah. It hasn't gotten any worse for him, and it's gotten better since then. I think we have some sound on tape of Mitchell McConnell smiling. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Speaker of the House, as she refuses to accept this acquittal, whatever that means. Perhaps she will tear up the verdict like she tore up the state of the union address. There is no sign this attack on her institutions will end here. Whatever policy differences we may have, we should all agree this is precisely the kind of recklessness, the kind of recklessness the Senate was created to stop. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: What do you make of that, Jesse? WATTERS: Well, I think he did a very good job as majority leader in the Senate, and he deserves a lot of credit for guiding this through. I think that Nancy tried to bully him. And Mitchell McConnell is not a man to be bullied, and that is very clear. This was not a closed vote. They were 20 votes short of conviction. It's not even in, like, the realm of possibility. GUTFELD: It was a partisan vote, which is the whole point of the two- thirds. WATTERS: They needed 67. They got 20 votes less than that. And you look at the Mueller investigation and now this impeachment trial. Trump is clean. Trump is an innocent man. He has been found guilty of zero crimes. And Juan, you said now that the American people are completely convinced this is a corrupt president. I would say this. I think the American people aren't going to believe any accusation by the Democrats against the president anymore, especially if it comes from an anonymous intelligence official like the last two hoaxes have come from. And that is your fault, because you didn't do it in the sunlight. You did it behind closed doors, and that is not the way you take out the president. WILLIAMS: You can keep arguing the process. I think -- the reason I asked if you were pumped was the man basically has got away with it. This is the man on Fifth Avenue shooting someone, as he's bragged, and his followers saying nothing. And after Mueller, where there was all this evidence again, he says I was exonerated. It's unbelievable. And we can expect to hear that. I hear he's going to give a statement tomorrow. I expect he will do that and he'll play to the base again. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: I want to finish here. He says basically what Republicans said today is Donald Trump, if you want to do this again, if you want to reach out to the Russians, to the Chinese, if you want to blame Ukrainians -- (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: Sell Alaska. WILLIAMS: Do whatever you want, because you, Donald Trump -- you know the best term I heard today? WATTERS: What's that? WILLIAMS: Dershowitz-ian, which is basically -- PERINO: Dershowitz-ian. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: I was, like, Dershowitz-ian which means anything that anytime the president acts -- as long as he thinks it helps his election and he thinks his election is best for the country, it's OK. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: That's a fact. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: Go read the quote. GUTFELD: I did. WILLIAMS: You know what the president says? Read the transcript. GUTFELD: No, I read it. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: In the interest of the country, then it obviously helps him in re-election. It's easy. WILLIAMS: Because you've got to re-elect Donald Trump -- (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: You're adding that. You're mind reading. You're adding a second part. WILLIAMS: He said if the president believes his re-election is in the best interest of the country, then fine, go for it. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: If you are investigating corruption or if you're trying to make a Middle East peace deal, that will actually help -- it just happens to help you get elected. That doesn't negate it. WATTERS: It's called a mixed motive. But I want to ask Juan a quick question, because I really want to hear his answer. WILLIAMS: OK. WATTERS: It is Trump innocent until proven guilty? WILLIAMS: Everybody is innocent until proven -- WATTERS: Thank you. Trump is innocent. WILLIAMS: But that is not a trial. This was impeachment. PAVLICH: I would argue that Juan keeps talking about the process -- (CROSSTALK) PAVLICH: It really shouldn't matter the Republicans focusing on it is a distraction. But in America, the process is everything. And the reason why Democrats are in the position that they are now is because they didn't go through the process in the House to make sure that they had a solid case that was ready to send to the Senate, which is exactly why Nancy Pelosi was steamrolled by her caucus from the beginning on this impeachment process. But we are moving on to more of Nancy Pelosi's behavior in just a minute. But President Trump just tweeted about the vote this afternoon. He said, quote, ""I will be making a public statement tomorrow at 12:00 p.m. from the White House to discuss our country's victory on the impeachment hoax,"" end quote. Also note in the media and Democrats told us it was a rock-solid case but that has fallen flat. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have a very rock-solid case. I think the case we have, if presented to a jury, would be a guilty verdict in about three minutes flat. JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He has, in fact, committed an impeachable offense. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The president committed the offenses, charged in the first article of impeachment. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Congress now knows that the president has committed impeachable offenses. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The president is guilty. He is guilty of committing impeachable offenses. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The president is guilty. Every fact shows that the president is guilty of these impeachable offenses. (END VIDEO CLIP) PAVLICH: And Democrats might not be done. Here's what House impeachment manager Jerry Nadler said earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Talking about everything, everything. And remember our investigations on the Mueller report that we never finished because we didn't get the witnesses. We will get those. We will continue with that. (END VIDEO CLIP) PAVLICH: Dana, is this ever going to end? PERINO: Well, Mitchell McConnell has said several times, which is there is nothing more you can learn from the second kick of a mule. And it's like touching the hot stove, gosh, don't ever do that again. You do it once when you're a kid and then you are cautious. I -- again, I still think that Nancy Pelosi's -- part of her frustration has to be that she got pushed into it. Now, they all have to say the same thing. They are all trying to say the same thing. Everybody is in their corners. But the president is actually come out on top. And all these numbers that are improving, it doesn't happen overnight but it's been pretty quickly. This has been going on for six months. And the country has been paying attention. Americans are smart. And they figured out how they feel about it. And they think that, one, they want to move on. And second, they think that they can fight this out at the ballot box. Six months is a long time, especially right before an election, and now we are just nine months before. You can have a baby between now and then. GUTFELD: Are you telling us something? PERINO: I said you could have a baby. GUTFELD: I do not have a womb, Dana. You know what? Maybe they should keep impeaching him because it makes them feel good. It occupies the Democrats' headspace. And it does -- let's be honest. It does make Trump better because he loves a good fight. It's like better than a Flintstones multivitamin. It gets him going. And it makes -- this is the other thing, makes him more sympathetic. It does. WILLIAMS: Is that right? WATTERS: Trump is the victim, Juan. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: He's been victimized by millions of Democrats and all of your investigators for many, many years. And that is why everybody feels sorry for the man. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: -- only he could put up with that much. WILLIAMS: What a man, what a man. He is your hero. But I must say Mitt Romney. I thought you said, oh, I believe it was a bipartisan vote. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: I said Mitt Romney, right? What happened to Republican unity on that front? (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: I don't see that -- Kristen Sinema, right? PAVLICH: Democrat? WILLIAMS: Doug Jones, what happened? (CROSSTALK) PAVLICH: Doug Jones doesn't have to worry about it. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: But what happened to Joe Manchin? Remember -- people don't vote on principle. Just vote to retain your power. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: First, it was a bipartisan. WILLIAMS: They voted from the heart as opposed to politics. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: Why would a Democrat vote guilty? That's from the heart. When a Republican votes acquit, that's political. What's the difference? WILLIAMS: Because I'm going to tell you what Republicans said, Rubio, Portman, Toomey, Collins, Murkowski, and Romney all said his actions were inappropriate and embarrassing. PAVLICH: Dana, I would like to hear from you. PERINO: Juan, they are not the only ones that have said that. Like, there are people like Ana (ph) McCarthy from the very beginning was like, well, the House should just do the censure vote. They should walk away, because otherwise they will walk right into impeachment. There's a lot of Republicans who have said all of those things, but don't think it was impeachable. I don't think that that is so out of the realm. I think overstating the Romney factor of the one person that decided to vote on one of the articles to convict and saying that that basically shattered Republican unity is a little bit -- (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: I don't think shattered. No, I just said it's a fact. In other words, there is a fact there's a Republican who voted -- (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: Judge Napolitano, you know right here at Fox News has been saying all along. This guy committed impeachable offenses. GUTFELD: He was wrong. I hate to say it. WILLIAMS: It's the power equation. Get elected. Protect yourself. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: What are you guys going to talk about after the trial? WILLIAMS: After the trial? WATTERS: Yeah, now that this is over? What are you guys going to complain about? WILLIAMS: Well, I'm not complaining. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: Why would I complain? WATTERS: You're going to have to focus on the Democrats. And you don't want to do that because that is a mess over there. You in the media are now going to be forced to focus on the Democrat primary. You don't have this impeachment anymore. You don't have another Trump scandal right now that you're cooking up. You have to focus on the Democrat primary, and that is going to be a nightmare. PAVLICH: Jesse, do you really think that they are not going to try and come up with some other scandal? WATTERS: Well, they've got to come up with something quick, Katie. WILLIAMS: I mean, look. It's still a fact. Half the American people think this guy should have been impeached. PERINO: But they did before -- impeachment was even started. WILLIAMS: No, that is what pushed Pelosi and the moderate Democrats to back impeachment. PAVLICH: None of this has been -- (CROSSTALK) PAVLICH: -- from the beginning. She had to go back on her word and say impeachment had to be bipartisan from the beginning. Democrats joined Republicans in the House to vote against it. And here we are now without the results that you think that you should have based on what you think the American people want. But it was political from the beginning. And the reflection of the impeachment polls reflects exactly how people come down, what they're voting on, and the momentum on this has been towards the president from the start. I mean, the poll numbers, the bipartisanship from the front end. I mean, that's been on his side. People have gone to that. Greg? GUTFELD: Well, I think, you know when I was watching the end of this vote. They all started to getting all friendly again. Did you see that? They started thanking people. They should thank the American people for putting up and sitting through this circus, and thank us for being so cogent in our analysis and seeing through this and being right all along. I didn't hear a thank you from them. I didn't hear it, and I am personally offended. WATTERS: I actually do want to say I was right all along. We told you from the very beginning that this was a phone call. These were weak articles. And there was going to be an acquittal. But all you did was whine the whole time. And you didn't listen to all we said, and the fact that Mitt Romney listened to a brilliant legal presentation, and he is a smart guy, and he came down on the side of guilty. Makes me think I don't think he was really open to hearing the legal analysis, because why would you vote for more witnesses if you were still open-minded and thinking about, oh, maybe this isn't a closed case? And then you get no witnesses and then you vote to convict. It doesn't add up. WILLIAMS: It was a strong case but -- the fact is you have John Bolton sitting out there. If you have documents, even today -- more documents coming out that indicate the president was intent on using this influence for his political and personal gain. Why not? (CROSSTALK) PAVLICH: -- the accusation will never end. You're continuing it. You're saying John Bolton, maybe, if. I don't know. WILLIAMS: No, no, no. I just think that he's sit -- John Bolton is sitting out there, right? PAVLICH: Yeah. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: -- he has direct knowledge. WATTERS: You know who else is sitting out there? WILLIAMS: Who's that? WATTERS: The whistle-blower. WILLIAMS: Yeah, so? WATTERS: Dems are going to call him. WILLIAMS: Oh my, gosh. WATTERS: We're going to hear from him. PAVLICH: And Hunter Biden, too. But we are going to move on. We're going to keep an eye on impeachment and we will let you know if there are any big updates. In the meantime, the other big story we are talking about, Nancy Pelosi shreds her copy of Trump's state of the union speech, up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WATTERS: Negative Nancy Pelosi making a big scene at the state of the union, even after hearing all that good economic news and stories about war heroes from President Trump. Nancy actually ripped up the speech and she continued to trash Trump while walking out of the capital. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why did you rip the speech up, Madam Speaker? NANCY PELOSI, HOUSE SPEAKER: Because it was the courteous thing to do, considering the alternatives. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: OK. Dana, what do you think motivated Speaker Pelosi to do that? PERINO: Three possibilities. One is obviously -- Chris Wallace reported yesterday that in the lunch he had with the Democrats before the speech, Pelosi and Trump have not spoken since October when they had that falling out. And so that relationship is quite broken, and I think that is part of it. WATTERS: Is that when she called him an impostor? PERINO: And he called her a third-rate politician. WATTERS: Got it. PERINO: Right. So it's like -- they both said things -- I don't know if they regret them but they both said things and so they're not talking. She left the door open, though, on lowering drug prices and infrastructure, though, in that lunch, though. The second possibility is that she is really, really frustrated with her caucus. As I said in April, I think that in a way, if she did it spontaneously, it's like, she just -- you know, sometimes you do get so mad and frustrated you want to rip something. Break a pen. I actually don't know if I could do that, break a pen. Or the third thing is it was planned all along. And she knew she was going to do it. And she did it on purpose so that the cameras could catch it, and she wanted to make a statement. WATTERS: What do you think that statement was, Greg? GUTFELD: Well, I don't know. I think she -- I think it was a perfect ending. You have -- it's like the climax of a movie where the villain gets beaten and throws her hat on the ground. It's like she tore up a betting slip that she bet her house on. And I think it -- for me, personally, it affected me and that it made me realize the speech was way better and more powerful than I thought. Because you could see the frustration build up in her, and I thought it was a pretty good speech. Then I go, well, maybe it really hit her where it hurts. On the other hand, we lead this segment talking about that, so she gets a win by focusing attention on this act. You take the attention away from the substance of the speech. That's why I wouldn't put too much emotion in it, even though I thought it was cheap. I mean, I think the bigger problem for me is, you know, I get it. You hate Trump. But can't you be happy for people who got jobs, who got welfare or not clapping for an African-American girl getting a scholarship? I mean, if a Republican didn't clap for that, my god. And the numbers for women employment, no applause from white women wearing white, I mean can't you say, yeah, I can't stand the guy but damn. He is doing good for them. WATTERS: Yeah. Katie, my theory was that she wanted to show AOC and that wing that she hated Trump just as much as they did, and she wanted a little street cred. PAVLICH: Yeah. WATTERS: And to say, you know, I'm one of you. PAVLICH: Which, again, she's getting totally steamrolled by the left of her party, which does not play well across the country. And by her doing that, she is trying to one up President Trump by taking attention away from him. But he -- she essentially wrote a campaign ad for him and a campaign ad for every single Republican running in the House to take back the power from her -- (CROSSTALK) PAVLICH: Right, proving that, you know, she cannot be trusted to just be a fair speaker who respects the process. But I think not standing for people who have school choice or for clapping at appropriate times when it comes to unemployment shows the Democrats really are interested in power. They're not necessarily interested in all these issues that they claim to care about. And also, you know the optics on this. You know, when Kayla Muller's parents were there, the young girl who was captured by ISIS, abused, raped, and murdered by Al-Baghdadi when they're talking -- when he is talking about that, and then Nancy Pelosi's back there shuffling her papers behind him and not paying attention to that. The optics there are not good. And so Nancy Pelosi can try and tell her left wing of the party and try to, you know, coddle them and make sure that they know she's doing all the right things for them. But overall, the country is looking at that and they can see that she has really played her hand poorly last night in a long line of things that have not gone well for her over the last six months. WATTERS: How would you react to that, Juan, if you were delivering commentary, and then I grabbed your nose and did that? WILLIAMS: I'm glad you haven't done that yet, but I expect any day. WATTERS: I would never. WILLIAMS: But I would say that if you're Nancy Pelosi and you were sitting there, I think it's easy to understand. You listen to this stuff for an hour and you get hugely frustrated. And I must say that this morning, she got a standing ovation from her Democratic caucus. WATTERS: That's why I think she was doing it for her base. WILLIAMS: No. I think she did it. I don't know if it was planned or whatever, but it was a successful gesture. And I will say this. When you look at the reality of what the President was doing, when he -- first, let's just -- I don't know about the handshake. Did he not see her hand out there, or did he, you know, snub her? I don't know. But clearly, they got an issue between the two of them. But I will say when the president says stuff like, oh, yes, we're doing more than anybody for pre-existing conditions -- and you just know this is not true. I'll let you decide if you want to call it a lie, but it's just not true. And when he does stuff like, oh, yes, I care so much about giving this scholarship to this little black girl, but I'm going to give the Medal of Freedom to Rush Limbaugh and then I'm going to do it like a reality show and have Mrs. Trump put it around his neck. You think to yourself, oh is Oprah giving away cars here today? PERINO: I think I think they were also frustrated because they are bested by him because he is a producer and a showman, and he knows how to talk on your -- I think that the whole speech, the great American comeback could have just been -- it was a great idea to build a theme, to build a speech around, and he could have just done all of the guests on the room, maybe edit a few more, and then said, I want to bring you more stories like this. I'm going to continue to work hard. I'd like to do this for the next four years. Can I say one thing about Nancy Pelosi? I'm not making this the strongest of predictions. But I think the other thing that could have been is that I think she knows that that's probably her last State of the Union that where she sits there, because one, like there's an election, so you never know what could happen. Like the Republicans come back then she wouldn't be the speaker. But I also think, remember, in 2018, when she won, she basically -- there was a wink and a nod that she would not run again. And so, her final act as a speaker at the State of the Union was to rip up the President's speech. I think it'll be like the second paragraph in the legend -- all the literature that's written about her in the future. WILLIAMS: Yes, people underestimate Nancy Pelosi. How's that worked out for you, Republicans? PERINO: I'm not underestimating her. WATTERS: What do you mean? I think Trump should ground her next flight. That's what I think. President Trump touts the booming economy and smacks down socialism in a must-see State of the Union moment. That's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PERINO: President Trump using his State of the Union speech to highlight major gains, as we've said so far in the show on the economy, but also delivered a very sharp takedown of socialism. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Socialism destroys nations, but always remember, freedom unifies the soul. 132 lawmakers in this room have endorsed legislation to impose a socialist takeover of our healthcare system, wiping out the private health insurance plans of 180 million very happy Americans. To those watching it home tonight, I want you to know, we will never let socialism destroy American healthcare. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: And Jesse, that was a call back to the 2019 State of the Union where he had the line that was the line of the night, I think, where you said social -- America will never be a socialist country. And so now he's getting more specific about healthcare. WATTERS: He is and he needs to. The story was the great American comeback blue-collar boom. And really, I think put the democrats on the defensive because he's rattling off these great economic achievements for the American people and the Democrats are sitting on their hands. He marginalized them on healthcare saying 130 of you in the House voted to take away 130 million Americans private healthcare. And by the way, they want to give it to illegal immigrants. That's a very extreme position. He had stuff for the base. He had stuff on guns, on pro-life, on immigration, the wall update, and then laid really sharp traps with these guests he had where he wells up the chamber with enthusiasm and emotion for these guests. And then he goes, oh, and by the way, this was the person whose husband died from a roadside bomb planted by Soleimani that I killed, and that was very effective. And then he had some bipartisanship too. He think he offered his hand on drug prices, the Mars mission infrastructure, a trillion trees. And at the end, it was a great show, well-produced drama. But the flourish at the end when he's talking about the American pioneer, the settlers, this adventure that we're all on, and this is a country with a very young spirit. The best is yet to come was a great quote. PERINO: And one of my favorite lines, they were just able to cut this sound for me. Of course, you know -- you know my feelings on terrorism and everything. Listen to this part right here about terrorism. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: Soleimani was the Iranian regime's most ruthless butcher, a monster who murders or wounded thousands of American service members in Iraq. Then, the U.S. military executed a flawless precision strike that killed Soleimani. Our message to the terrorist is clear, you will never escape American justice. If you attack our citizens, you forfeit your life. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: So that was what you were saying, Jesse, I'll go to you, Katie next. So he gets everybody applauding because you're feeling for the man who lost his brother, and then you find out oh, there's a policy out here too, which is that I'm saying that this is where America is going to stand. PAVLICH: And it goes to -- you know, he's really done a good job of balancing not getting America into another war as he promised, but also going after terrorism in a very real way. Last week, we killed al-Qaeda leader in Yemen, Baghdadi. He has a whole list of accomplishments. PERINO: He got the other guy in Arizona too. PAVLICH: And that guy too, the Iraqi police -- the Iraqi who came to America somehow and he had killed an Iraqi police officer, so they did get him. But yeah, he's able to stand up and have a record on that and say I'm going to take care of Americans and protect them. We're going use our tools to do it. And the thing about the Soleimani strike is that everyone was questioning when he would respond. Like why isn't the president responding to Iranian aggression? And that patience paid off with him with that victory for the - - PERINO: There was also a lot of outreach to Americans like broadening -- I think he was trying to broaden beyond the base. Listen to Van Jones over at CNN. Greg, we'll get your take. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VAN JONES, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: What he was saying to African- Americans can be effective. You may not like it, but he mentioned HBCUs, our black colleges have been struggling for a long time, a bunch of them have gone under. He threw a lifeline to them in real life, in this budget. He talked about that. He talked about the criminal justice reform. He talked about opportunity zones. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: That stood out to you too? GUTFELD: Trump is doing something that I think the Republicans haven't done in a while and Van Jones is seeing this for what it is and his -- some of his co-hosts failed to see it. It used to be that if you don't help minorities, you were called racist. Now if you help minorities, the left to say you're racist too, because you're trying to cover up the fact that you're racist. So if you promise you'll even be more helpful than you probably in the KKK, what Van Jones is saying essentially is that Trump is making it clear that he's putting Blacks first, while Democrats see Blacks as a group that competes among a bevy of other groups, because it's such an identity, obsessive party, that you're just a pocket. You have the best numbers for minorities in women. And in an even interesting thing, Trump is like one of the best liberal presidents we've seen. I mean, he's a better Democrat than most Democrats. You talk about prison reform, you talk about drug pricing, you talk about a trillion trees, you talk about black colleges, I mean, he's out Obama-ing Obama. And I think that's what Van Jones is getting at. Like, listen to the guy. PERINO: Juan, do you want to comment on that? WATTERS: Is it triangulation? GUTFELD: I don't know. WATTERS: Trump triangulation? GUTFELD: That means something else. PERINO: Anyway, Juan, what do you think about any or all of that? WILLIAMS: You know, I'm just sad. I got to tell you something. Sometimes you just feel despondent these days in American politics. You just think, am I crazy or are they crazy? Because when you talk about, for example, the drug pricing. You have people there in the chamber last night, if you believe this, if you say you will sign it, well then, sign HR-3 which is the Elijah Cummings bill to pull down. But no, he says it, and David Axelrod said this last night on T.V. He was very much a showman like speech. And Trump is great at putting reality T.V. together. Let the fact-checkers check after because most Americans just see the speech, and all these fact trackers, they're whining, they're just going on. PERINO: That's true with all speeches. WILLIAMS: And then -- so people will listen to this falsehood, this is the greatest economy? The economy -- the GDP is two. It's less than Trump promised. PAVLICH: Trump is also really going to say -- WILLIAMS: Where is the wall? Where is the healthcare? Where is the bringing -- remember he said he's going to bring troops home? We're sending troops out. He gets away with this. PERINO: All right. OK, we have more to come because we're going to talk about the Democrats Iowa Caucuses catastrophe. It continues. You won't believe this. We have it next. And why Joe Biden should be pretty worried. The latest next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WILLIAMS: Welcome back. More caucus chaos in Iowa. Poll results are still not in. Can you believe that? Right now, what we have is 86 percent of the total -- what was it, two days after? Pete Buttigieg now is holding a very narrow lead over Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden stuck in a disappointing fourth place. Here's the former vice president reacting today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I am not going to sugarcoat it. We took a gut punch in Iowa. The whole process took a gut punch. But look, this isn't the first time in my life I've been knocked down. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: Meanwhile, former Clinton advisor James Carville, he's out with a major warning for the Democrats. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAMES CARVILLE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: It matters who the candidate is, it matters what a party chooses to talk about. I mean, I'm 75 years old. Why am I here doing this? Because I am scared to death. That's why. This party needs to wake up and make sure that we talk about things that are relevant to people. We're like talking about people voting from jail cells. All right, we're talking about not having a border. I mean, come on people. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: Wow. So Katie, what you -- PAVLICH: He said, come on people. WILLIAMS: Come on people. So Katie, when you hear James Carville who, you know, is really I think in touch with Democratic Party politics, that he's scared of Bernie Sanders. How do you as a Republican hear that? PAVLICH: Well, I'm a conservative and I'm not a registered Republican. WILLIAMS: OK. PAVLICH: But I will say, I think that he's more in touch with the rest of the country. And if you look at the polling on Bernie Sanders' policies, people do not like the socialism aspect of this. And Joe Biden coming out of Iowa, while his communications director is still questioning the validity of the results, Joe Biden is taking the L essentially, and also going after Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg pretty hard, and said today, look, if Bernie Sanders wins the nomination, every single Democrat running for any kind of office will have the label of socialists over their head, and we're going to have to explain that. And that's not going to work when it comes to Democrats who feel like the party has gotten far too left for their liking when it comes to issues like health care and other economic factors. WILLIAMS: You know, one other factor Jesse, Biden is low on cash right now, very low, so he's got to do a lot of fundraising. I don't know. What do you think when you hear people who are dyed in the wool Democrats say that Sanders' brand of populism may be detrimental to the Democratic cause in November? WATTERS: I would agree with them. And that's what I've been saying. WILLIAMS: Wait a second. I thought you guys were -- especially that guy over there was pumping up -- GUTFELD: Who, me? WILLIAMS: Pumping up -- WATTERS: He thinks -- he thinks Bernie is like the second coming of Trump. I think he's overthinking it. With respect, because you never overthinking it. With respect. I think Biden comes out of Iowa zero delegates. WILLIAMS: OK. WATTERS: I think Bernie is going to win New Hampshire. Biden maybe gets second, maybe third. Maybe Pete gets second. He might not come out with any delegates at New Hampshire. And right now, it's a dead heat in Nevada, Bernie or Biden. Biden could go O and three going into South Carolina. I just don't think it's going to happen. I do not think he's going to get the nomination. Everyone that's saying Bernie is this big threat to Trump, I would just have to disagree. Everyone over 50 years old hates Bernie Sanders, only very liberal and very young Americans like Bernie Sanders. He's going to go in there, as Carville said, saying the Boston bombers should be allowed to vote in the election, and he'll probably vote for Bernie, and I'm going to take away your health care and give it to an illegal immigrant. The guy's a communist sympathizer. He's been in the Senate for decades, never done a damn thing. He's not photogenic. Hillary hates him. The powers (INAUDIBLE) hate him. It's only going to cause chaos. It's not going to be a good thing for Bernie or the Democrats are. And that's why I want Bernie to win. WILLIAMS: I know. But anyway, I'm short on time, but I want to get the two of you in. The idea that the establishment, the Democratic Party establishment like Carville is now in a fright -- PERINO: They're raising -- right so they should -- they let Bernie Sanders take over a lot of the responsibilities of the DNC. The DNC is basically kind of powerless, they've kept -- they've basically had to bend to him. He has all of this support out there. Biden might be short on cash. Let me just tell you quickly. I think that what could help him quickly is if Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, maybe some of the other -- maybe Michael Bennett, he's real low in the polls, if they could all get behind and say we are coalescing behind Biden, that might inspire some confidence. WILLIAMS: What -- is this like what the Republican saw with Trump? GUTFELD: Perhaps. But I love that Liz Warren came in fifth in Pocahontas County, Iowa. If you can't win a county that was named after you, you got no chance in America if you can't win in Pocahontas County. Anyway, I wanted them to only release half the caucus results so I could say the Dems left Iowa halfcocked. WATTERS: Well done. PERINO: Well, the Dems also left Iowa on private jets including Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. So green new deal for you, but not for them. WILLIAMS: Oh boy. ""ONE MORE THING"" coming up next. They're just for fun. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GUTFELD: Time for ""ONE MORE THING."" I'm going first. It's time for Greg's Plugs. Pretending that that's my real hair. It is. All right, so live show, the Gutfeld Monologues will be in Memphis March 21st, and then Nashville March 22nd. We got some surprise special guests showing up. Go to GGutfeld.com to buy tickets. It's going to be amazing. Also, my podcast is up. It's with Dr. Marc Siegel. And we get to the bottom of the coronovirus or coronavirus and separate fact from fiction. That's Fox News podcast.com. Now it's time for Jessie. WATTERS: You need to update your tour full screen with your new haircut. GUTFELD: Yes, that's true. WATTERS: I don't even know who that guy is anymore. GUTFELD: Yes, that guy, he's dead. To me he's dead. WATTERS: All right, scary moment at the Chiefs championship parade in Kansas City. Kansas City, Missouri, Juan, or Kansas -- who knows where it is? (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: There's a highspeed chase in the parade route. And they had the pole, the old pit maneuver. There it is. PERINO: Wow. WATTERS: So they had two guys pulled over, arrested, and they were under the influence as expected. Surprise, surprise. GUTFELD: Wow. PERINO: And that should still be a felony. GUTFELD: That'll be on -- you'll see that footage for the next 10 years on cable. All right, where am I, Dana? PERINO: I haven't something also Kansas City related. So this is -- they won 31 to 20, was that the score? And Derrick Nnadi, he started his celebration by making snow angels with confetti on the field. Of course, that's pretty fun. But he also said he would help animals as well. So in partnership with KC Pet Project, Nnadi paid up the adoption fees for every single dog in all of the shelters locations. So that's nearly 80 pets. They've already left the shelters with new families and more are expected to head home today. He's been working with KC Pet Project for quite a while even before they got into the playoffs. And he would cover the cost of a different dog's adoption each time. So he's pretty amazing guy and congratulations to the Chiefs. And congrats to all the new dog family members. WATTERS: She's a fan now, aren't you? GUTFELD: Pound for pound. PERINO: Oh, yes, I'm big time. GUTFELD: Juan? WILLIAMS: Well, I was a nice thing to do. Anyway, you never know where you're going to find genius. So how about the sixth grade? Well, take a look at this group of sixth-graders from McClintock Middle School in Charlotte. They devised a way to help a toddler with a rare genetic disorder. Children with Kabuki Syndrome needed daily help in the form of an oxygen tank. But you know, how do you get around with an oxygen tank if you're a little guy? That's where the sixth graders entered. They came up with a device that allows Emmett Hightshoe to easily move around with her oxygen tank. Emmett's mom said this project by the sixth graders is life-changing not only for the child, but for the family, and of course lots of other families with the same disorder. Way to go sixth graders. GUTFELD: That's why math and science matter to people. WILLIAMS: Yes. PAVLICH: And they'll become engineers and they will do even more good for the rest of the world. All right, so dogs sometimes get themselves in trouble. So this little puppy named Kahuna was exploring his home when something happened. Take a listen. So you see, the nine-month-old pooch was sniffing something on top of an ironing board when it tipped over. And then the items fell down on a heater grate, and an hour later or later, everything erupted into flames. But the two dogs who were in the house at the time were evacuated and firefighters were able to put out the fire and there was limited damage to the house. WATTERS: I put my dog up for adoption if he do that. GUTFELD: And that would pay for the adoption. WATTERS: Yes. And Nnadi would pay for it. GUTFELD: Yes. WILLIAMS: That's after you win the Super Bowl. GUTFELD: Exactly. PERINO: It's scary. WATTERS: Bad dog. PERINO: It's scary. GUTFELD: Everybody has -- no dogs can get away with anything because you have cameras everywhere. WILLIAMS: That's what I noticed. There was a camera. How did they get a camera in there? WATTERS: All right. ""Special Report"" is up next. Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

87,FOX,"Democrats invented a new kind of crazy: Knowing the outcome of an event well in advance and still expecting a different result. Impeachment is over, at least for now. You've heard the definition of crazy before. It’s doing the same thing over and over again while expecting a different result. Well, Democrats invented a new kind of crazy: knowing the outcome of an event well in advance, and still expecting a different result. That was impeachment, the worst-planned adventure since the Donner party. Democrats blew all their energy on a loser's bet, one that made the Iowa mess possible. Instead of wowing America, they fell flat on their faces because they were distracted. GREGG JARRETT: TRUMP ACQUITTAL IN IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IS A HUMILIATING DEFEAT FOR PARTISAN DEMOCRATS I return to Greg's Rule: Republicans run things. Democrats ruin them. The difference is one letter. It stands for ""impeachment."" So once again, the losers return to their hallucinations. The snakes on the wall? They're real – if you're Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. Now, Schiff says, President Trump could offer Alaska to the Russians ""in exchange for support in the next election."" Alternatively, Schiff said, Trump ""could decide to move to Mar-a-Lago permanently and let Jared Kushner run the country."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER So why cling to these crazy predictions? Because they don't exist. That means you can't disprove them. The response will always be, ""You just wait."" They're like imaginary mice, and Schiff's the crazy coot on the table screaming. Those mad ravings had us waiting for a stock market crash, tyranny and world war under Trump. They were all paranoid nightmares that never came. Instead, all we got were stock market highs, trade deals, dead terrorists and jobs. Since those successes were under Trump, the delusions only deepen. Without a real vision beyond anger, the Democrats cling to these mental phantoms. Early on, we told Democrats impeachment was a dead fish. We said:  Don't follow Adam! He's selling you drugs that only end in bad trips. But did they listen? Nope. To them, bad drugs are better than no drugs. That’s why they'll be back in the lab coming up with a new paranoia pill. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But we know not to gulp them.

88,FOX,"Iowa Democratic Party chairman apologizes, calls failure to deliver results from caucuses unacceptable; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" February 4, 2020 . This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  (CROSSTALK)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When does -- independent party -- never tested state wide. And why did the Iowa Democratic Party denied the Department of Homeland Security offer to test the app?  TROY PRICE, IOWA DEMOCRATIC PARTY CHAIRMAN: We have one -- I have no knowledge of the Department of Homeland Security making that offer to us. I will say that we have worked with cyber-security experts -- nationally renowned cyber security experts to test this app and do testing and security checks on this app. So we took the steps we felt was necessary, but we found a coding error last night. Once we discovered some irregularities as the results started to come out. What's that?  No, there weren't. And that is why what happened last night is simply unacceptable. And so, again, we're going to have a thorough and independent review of exactly what happened last night. We still -- right now, we are in the process of making sure that we get these results out. And that is what we are going to stay focused on.  (CROSSTALK)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Donald Trump has suggested that the process is rigged. How do you combat that? How do you assure Americans that this is trustworthy?  PRICE: We have said all along that we are going to make these caucuses the most transparent possible. This year, we are reporting out more data than we ever have reported before. And in addition to that, we have paper trails that we have never had before. And so we're going to take the time we need to verify these results. But these results are being based off what happened in the precincts last night.  (CROSSTALK)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you feeling pressure to step aside?  PRICE: When I ran for Chair, I made a commitment to see the caucus process through. That is what I'm working on. That is what I will continue to work on. And whatever happens after that is to be determined. Anyways, thank you all, folks. The results are coming in. We will see you later.  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: All right. So you were just looking at the Iowa Democratic Chair trying to explain the debacle in Des Moines last night. We have THE FIVE. We are all going to get to come. You'll hear from Katie Pavlich, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld, and myself. But let's first bring in Bret Baier and Martha. There are those guys.  But we have Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum. They're going to break it all down for us. What did you just hear? It was a little bit of an apology and a promise that there's going to be a review, and that you can be assured that the results that they are going to present to us are accurate.  BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST: Yeah. He said it was -- saying it is unacceptable, and that they're going to try to get to the bottom of it. Bottom line, he's going to put out 62 percent of the vote. You're going to see this on your screen once we get the actual vote dump from the Iowa Democratic Party. At that point, the Fox News decision desk is going to make a decision whether we can make a stipulation of where everybody came in.  First, second, third, and fourth, based on what we had going in and the raw vote total they dumped right now at this hour.  MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: All right, obviously, this is a very unusual situation. And you also have the campaigns weighing in with the numbers that they believe they have. They have their own apps, and counting people at all of these precincts across the state of Iowa. So brace yourself for what could be a battle over these numbers when we start to get them, because it's clear that they may not line up perfectly with what the candidates think is fair.  And Joe Biden's team already said last night that they would consider some form of legal action if they feel like the numbers aren't on the up and up. So a lot riding on that, gentlemen, Troy Price's shoulders right now as these numbers roll out, Dana.  PERINO: Indeed a lot of accountability. All right, Bret and Martha, we are going to keep you there in the studio next door. Let's take it to THE FIVE up in New York. Juan and I are in D.C. Let me start there. Look at all these fine people. You got Katie Pavlich, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld and his unicorn cup.  Greg, let me start with you about just your general thoughts as this all went down last night. We were there in a very quiet convention center waiting for results. We never got them.  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: I know. This was the Democrats' first day of school and they showed up in their underwear. And then they proceeded to throw up on everybody. I think everybody has had that nightmare. And they've got a whole that they have to dig themselves out of. The other -- I have a thing like Gutfeld's Law. Would you like to hear it?  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Republicans run things. Democrats ruin things. And one difference is I, which for four years stood for impeachment. They were so consumed by an outside phantom from Moscow that they failed to realize that the phone call was actually calling -- coming from inside their own house that they had issues. They had four years, four years to figure this out and they didn't.  I mean, they should've listened to Joe Biden and learned how to code, because this is so embarrassing. It just shows you that Dems can't run anything. They can't run cities. They can't run websites. They -- remembers cars for clunkers. The Puerto Rico disaster relief, they can't run anything.  PERINO: Well, look, I mean, it is absolutely embarrassing. And you have the chair there, Jesse, trying to say -- well, he did say he was sorry, but this is a big debacle.  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Apology not accepted. I don't think that guy exuded confidence. Maybe I'm wrong. I just didn't buy what he was slinging. I actually can't believe I'm going to say this. I've never said it before.  PERINO: You feel sorry for them?  WATTERS: But I feel sorry for Democrats, I do.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: I feel sorry for the voters in Iowa, because elections are supposed to be fun. It's supposed to be a great night, and they got robbed. And they got robbed by a crooked firm. Literally, the firm that did the app was run by Hillary Clinton staffers. They didn't need the app and the app didn't work. They got paid to roll the app out anyway.  GUTFELD: Wow.  WATTERS: And they're laughing all the way to the bank because they still get to keep the money. They didn't vet it. They say they tested it. They didn't roll it out by Department of Homeland Security. And then they said, oh, DHS never offered. We will see about that, because I bet there is a paper trail for that. And Greg is right.  This is why Trump was elected, because powerful people don't deliver results for the American people. And Democrats, above everything else, they have to be competent. And they have to be more competent, because their entire agenda is put us in charge. Let us control your healthcare, your food, your energy, your car, your lifestyle, because we know how to do it better than you.  And when something like this happens and they face-plant, that destroys their entire brand. And I am sick of hearing the mainstream media mock Trump supporters for being dumb hillbillies. They can't read a map. They can't even read. Making fun of Donald Trump misspelling something on Twitter, and they go out and they do something so catastrophically stupid. It blows up their entire brand of these brilliant, sophisticated leaks --  PERINO: OK, OK.  WATTERS: -- that understand technology. You know, Republicans don't believe in science, remember? But these guys have it all under control. Please.  PERINO: Now, it was, Juan, the mainstream media actually that was amongst the most critical. One, because they were furious, they wanted the result. But also, they spent all that time and effort and money covering this campaign. And then you get to the big night. You don't get any results. And now, I think that even though the chair says that all of this is going to be accurate and assured.  And the integrity of the election is of utmost importance. Do you think they'll be able to actually convince people of that?  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: No. I think that was an unmitigated disaster, a disaster, as Dana pointed out, for all the good people of Iowa who trekked off to the gym or the firehouse or the schoolhouse to caucus last night. And, you know, it is a wonderful exercise in American democracy. I've been there. And I to tell you those people are so proud.  And I have got to believe they are so hurt by what happened, just a terrible thing. And, you know, to what Greg and Jessie were saying, I've got to say it's a pretty good talking point that stuff about the Democrats now. How can you trust them health care? Look, I get it. I think that really works with the Trump base.  Although, I still think I haven't seen anything on healthcare coming from President Trump and the Republicans to this day after all those replace and repeal votes. But the key here for me is now all the conspiracy theories and the division among Democrats. Who does this help? Who does this hurt? What we are going to get in a few minutes is only about -- according to the Iowa Democratic Party.  Only 60 percent of the results, so there are still going to be arguments about who was helped, which cities, which sites did this come from, and could it be that the remaining 40 percent would change their results?  PERINO: Juan, speaking of that, we actually have the first results. And Martha and Bret, if you're still there with us, if you could share with us what do we know?  BAIER: You know, 62 percent. And you're seeing this on the screen. These are the precincts that are in. There's a slight lead for Mayor Pete Buttigieg over Bernie Sanders. You see Elizabeth Warren in third, and Joe Biden back at under 16 percent in forth, Amy Klobuchar at 13 percent in these early numbers. Now, let's just be sure that we understand.  This is 62 percent of the precincts. This is not the whole picture. And this could change as we get more of not only the raw vote total, but also what our decision desk is going to look at going in with our voter analysis.  MACCALLUM: And obviously, we want to keep an eye on the counties and get a feel for which counties are still out there and where those counties are and how they might impact the remaining movement of these votes, as we take a look. But I mean, clearly a good night for Pete Buttigieg, anyway you stretch it. I mean, even if he ends up in second place and Bernie Sanders in first place.  And that could happen as the rest of these numbers come in. He claimed victory last night. He got a lot of heat for it. And it did feel like he jumped the gun given the situation as it was unfolding. But clearly, he has performed well here. And no doubt -- and he's already, you know, crowing about in New Hampshire as he's moved on there to campaign.  BAIER: We should point out one thing, Dana. The internal Sanders numbers they put out today say that he is going to pull this out in the end at about 30 percent over Buttigieg at 24 percent. They are going by their precinct captains and their internal vote count. We can't, you know, confirm that. But looking at these numbers at 62 percent, you realize how lucky Joe Biden was last night to get out of there.  Because he is fourth, fourth, the former vice president of the United States, who now heads into New Hampshire where Bernie Sanders is running strong.  PERINO: Martha or Bret, do you know in -- do you know what the voter turnout was? And that was one of the questions last night, was if the turnout was more like 2016 than it was in 2008, that that didn't sound too good for the Democrats. Do we know anything about that from these numbers?  BAIER: They are still staying with 2016 right now. They're saying that it's roughly about 170,000. That is not a good number for Democrats over all. It may be better for Mayor Pete Buttigieg than it is for Sanders. Sanders would've benefited from the 240, the Barack Obama year number, 240,000. It looks closer to 2016, 170,000.  MACCALLUM: If that holds when we get the full look at this, I think that is one of the big story lines here as well. And it begs the question is there a candidate who is really driving this race on the Democrat side and exciting people to get out and vote and participate in all of this? They were really expecting blow-out numbers, that they might even surpass the number in 2008 for President Obama, which was around 240,000.  So that is something to watch really closely, and we will see if it changes as we get the rest of these numbers.  BAIER: One other thing. The Klobuchar campaign thinks that their internal numbers show them right neck and neck with Joe Biden in fourth and maybe even overtaking him. So again, the rest of these precincts we have to watch closely.  PERINO: Well, the Joe Biden campaign was setting very low expectations yesterday afternoon, and this might be explain why. Bret and Martha, we'll be back to you in a minute. Before I get back to Juan who has something to say, Katie Pavlich, we haven't had a chance to hear from you. Last night, just to talk about Mayor Pete, if he does -- this is 62 percent.  At 26 percent, he's in the lead. The line that really, you know, got everybody's eyes wide in the event last night is when this was all uncertain, he said we have turned an undeniable hope and it became an improbable victory. And it just felt premature, but maybe he knew something.  KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS HOST: He either knew something or just took the opportunity while everyone was sitting around trying to fill air time while we were waiting for these results. You know, 62 percent is still a D. It is two percent away from a failing grade. And the question I think that Democratic voters, especially, who made the effort to go out and caucus for their candidate and maybe change their mind and went over to somebody else is, how are we supposed to trust these results?  I mean, the chairman didn't come out and really say anything about the details of what happened. He said there were irregularities that beg the question about more explanation about really what happened. Where did the money go? Why is it that a party that's been sure worried about election meddling from Russia for the last three years didn't take Homeland Security's offer, which they say was on the table to vet the app and the cyber concerns that they had going into the caucus.  There are, I think, going to be a lot of questions rather than answers. And when it comes to an independent and thorough investigation, who's going to do the investigation and how long is that going to take what Democrats are -- as you mentioned Pete Buttigieg flying out to Iowa and they're all claiming victory here just like, you know, Amy Klobuchar essentially did last night for getting out first and --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: Indeed. Juan, you had a quick thought?  WILLIAMS: Well, you know, the thing about Iowa is it is politics, but also it is media. It's the balance that you get coming out of Iowa. That balance should've been there this morning. So just based on the numbers we've seen so far that have Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders in the lead, they're not going to get that big bounce. They have lost a tremendous opportunity in this moment.  We've got state of the union tonight. We've got the vote for acquittal in the impeachment tomorrow. Those are the headlines. And, you know, it's -- when you get that media balance it leads to donors and money. Pete Buttigieg clearly outperformed. He will get something. But I think a lot of Democrats who ran and put their heart into Iowa, I'm thinking specifically Amy Klobuchar. They really got ripped off.  PERINO: Greg, I read -- wish I could remember where I saw this, because I would like to give them credit. But I will just repeat here. And if you said on Twitter, congratulations, it caught my eye that this was really a win for socialists last night, because everybody walked away with a victory.  GUTFELD: I think I said that, Dana, if you don't remember it.  PERINO: OK, I will give you credit for it.  GUTFELD: Thank you. I didn't say that. But it is true. Every body went home with a trophy. But Juan is right. It's completely deflated. And to Katie's point, we had a party that had been seeding the -- sowing the seeds of doubt about our voting system. So in a weird way, they kind of got what they wanted through their own obsession over Russia and their own incompetence.  Now, who are they going to blame? Are they going to the Electoral College or Trump or the Russians? Meanwhile, as Jesse points out, the company, Shadow Inc., what a great name, I guess spies at night was taken. But it was linked to Clinton. And I think that -- you could make a lot of money if you sell something called a Clinton detector.  It's like a smoke or carbon monoxide detector and you just wave it in all the rooms, and it can detect a color-less, odor-less gas of a Clinton influence and then you can just fire those people. Lastly, to Jesse's point about how people mock the Trump supporters, it really is mocking the outsiders versus the insiders, because if you remember when a Trump administration took shape in 2016, those jokes were always about how stupid these outsiders were.  They were hiring terrible people. They were making awful mistakes. Now, you have these political pros and they can't do it. I think -- big winner here is Bernie. Bernie is their Trump. I would not joke about him getting the nominee. And I would say he's going to be the strongest person against Trump, because he galvanized the distaste and dislike for all the people, all the insiders, and elitists, the Clintonites.  The same way Trump galvanized it on the right. He's going to do it on the left. And you're going to see -- I think it is going to be Sanders-Trump.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: Jesse, I was going to mention that one of the things that I read this week was from Jonathan Chait in New York Magazine. And he said in 2016 there was that populist fervor. And you had some Bernie people say that they ended voting for President Trump because they were so mad about what happened to them and the DNC and all those changes that resulted from that.  But he also writes that the financial anxieties that existed in 2016 amongst people who have a populist band, those have been alleviated. And you today in Gallup that President Trump has a 63 percent approval rating in the handling of the economy.  WATTERS: Right. Well, it's bizarre to run a socialist during a record- breaking economic boom. It just doesn't make sense to most people. To Greg's point and to Juan's point, they really stole Bernie's momentum last night. If this thing goes the way Bernie's folks say it goes and he comes out ahead, then he loses that wind to his back going into New Hampshire where he is ahead in the last two or three polls.  So for me at least, Joe is on the ropes. And not reporting the results really softened the blow, but it's even worse than that. He had the whole state to himself or three weeks. He was on air with Super Pac money for the last week solo. I don't know if Pelosi's deal backfired. But if you think about it, all we heard in January was about where's Hunter, quid pro Joe, and Burisma.  That couldn't have helped things. And I think a lot of donors are going to get on the phone today and say the well is dry, Joe. We're going somewhere else. He didn't have a good fourth quarter last fundraising time.  PERINO: Yeah.  WATTERS: And I don't think people are going to come back and throw money around at this loser. He has to win somewhere, or else the whole electability rationale doesn't mean anything. He's not winning any elections.  PERINO: Katie, let's talk about Amy Klobuchar for a moment. Because as her team says, like, she's close with Biden but they are both going to be fourth or fifth when this is all said and done. Iowa's -- she was basically putting all of her chips and Iowa. If she does have this result, if it turns out to be at the end when they have all the votes in that she's only in fourth place. What does she do? What's the calculation there?  PAVLICH: Well, I think the calculation at this point is that Iowa, again, how long is it going to last when it comes to these results. When they get a 100 percent of reporting, people are going to have major questions about the process and whether the numbers are accurate and match all the data, how long is that going to take.  And now that everybody has already kind of moved on to New Hampshire, it's become really ground zero now for starting over, and really becoming the first state when it comes to actual results. You know, she can prove that she's willing to work hard. She's willing to be the underdog during impeachment. She flew into Iowa and flew out the next morning.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: Katie, let me interrupt you there. Bret and Martha have an update for us, some little news there, Bret and Martha.  BAIER: Well, I just want to point out something. The percentages you are looking at the screen, this is essentially the Iowa Democratic Party's final alignment. This would be after a caucus, after somebody doesn't qualify, and some people go to another corner. This is not the popular vote, the first alignment that we talked about. As confusing as this sounds, just bear with us.  (CROSSTALK)  MACCALLUM: -- so what we are asking is we were told by the Iowa Democratic Party that they were going to release the first alignment number, then the realignment number, and the final number. So this is the number that we are seeing that's going to go into the delegate count, ultimately. So one way that Larry Sabato's putting it right now is Buttigieg won the Electoral College and Sanders won the popular vote.  So the question is when voters -- you know, we talked last night about how some of these districts were -- you know, Biden was not viable in some of these areas, so where did that vote go? It appears that it went to Buttigieg.  (CROSSTALK)  BAIER: Because Sanders leads with 28,220, Mayor Pete, 27,030, Warren, 22,254, Biden all the way back down at 14,176. These are popular votes. That's first alignment stuff, just wanted to put that in there as we wait for more numbers.  PERINO: But then what really matters in the end then?  BAIER: The numbers you see on the screen, because that leads to the delegates, the percentage of the 41 delegates that Iowa is going to dole out.  MACCALLUM: Once again, you're going to have a situation like you have last time where Bernie Sanders is claiming that he won because he has the popular vote. And also, that he is the person who forced this issue, so that we have this new system in the first place, and he ended up sort of at the same boat.  PERINO: Wow. Let's get Juan's thoughts on that, Juan, some frustration there amongst Democrats?  WILLIAMS: Look, delegates count. That is how you get the nominee. So it's the delegate count. But I just want to point out that when you have the party handling this, it gets wild. I mean, I go back 2012. Remember the Romney-Santorum race where they said Romney won. And then the Republican Party of Iowa then says several weeks later, oh, no. Santorum won and got delegates.  This is really a -- it's not about a conspiracy theory. I think this is about absolute confusion, malfeasance in terms of management that the Democratic Party of Iowa has to be held accountable for. I think they have damaged the process and the faith in the process. And that is what goes forward. It absolutely contributes to the idea that Bernie Sanders and his supporters, the Bernie-bros, will say we are getting screwed and ripped off again.  Meanwhile, Pete Buttigieg is going to say I'm getting hurt. And guess what? Joe Biden, I thought a lot of people were going to say Joe Biden might be behind this. In fact, you see kind of crossfire now between Sanders and Pete Buttigieg as each is saying behind the scenes. I am blaming him. I'm blaming him. This is really now a circular firing squad on the Democratic side.  PERINO: So Greg, let me ask you. When you talk about Bernie Sanders, how does he take the strong support he has and broadened that out? Because you can't win with just the support he has. He has to either get the Democratic Party behind him in some way or to peel off some of the Trump voters which seem a little improbable.  GUTFELD: Yeah. I don't think that's going to happen at all. What's interesting, -- what they have in common, a lot of people voted for Trump even though he didn't express the same principles they did, right? It was like, you know, I didn't -- I'm free trade. He's not free trade. People question whether he was actually pro-life. And a lot of conservatives who became never-Trumpers believed that he was not sufficiently conservative.  On the Democratic side, you could do the same where this guy is crazy socialist. He's like -- even too left for us, but would override it both Trump and Sanders is the need to burn the house down. That is a very strong emotion, especially when something like this happens. And when you feel like you are being screwed and Trump rode that emotion about you are not being represented by the people in D.C.  They are screwing you over. And like, the mirror image, I swear, is Sanders, who maybe wrong on every single issue you believe in. But what he is right on is the same thing Trump was, which is a deep dissatisfaction for the people who looked down at you, who think you are dumb. And I think he's got that. What is amazing to me is that how Trump keeps seems to keep winning without actually doing anything.  Because of what the Democrats are doing, I mean, this helps him. He's got a state of the union tonight. This is, like, this makes him look even better.  WATTERS: Yeah. I mean, this makes Trump look like a competent, steady manager who has guided this economy into a league that we haven't seen before. And to Greg's point about the economic anxiety. I think where Trump survives this in a race against someone like Bernie Sanders is because of the Trump economic recovery has been from the bottom up.  If this was a recovery only on Wall Street and you still had that Obama era malaise where people were getting hosed. People feel like it was rigged against them. Wages were stagnant. And people feel like they weren't getting a fair shake, then Trump would've been vulnerable. But I think because his focus on the middle class, on the trade deals, on things immigration, and because of the massive regulation cuts.  He's been able to have a bottom up recovery, which kind of insulates him from the Bernie Sanders attack that this guy's from the rich. We need to burn the system down. Because right now the system, capitalism, free-market capitalism, is actually doing a lot better than it has been in say, a decade or two or even three.  PERINO: Let me ask -- Katie, can I get you to talk a little but about -- if the team could put up the alignment numbers again. I want to talk about some of the people that got significant amount of press. And yet, they were all at less than one percent. And I'm talking about Andrew Yang, Tulsi Gabbard, and Tom Steyer, the billionaire who put a lot of money into things.  PAVLICH: Well, look. Social media is not something that only reaches Iowa. And a lot of these candidates are trying to campaign not just in the first state but also around the country, obviously. But when it comes to what the media decides to focus on. There is the establishment version of people thinking that they can focus on all of the wrong candidates for all the wrong reasons.  Joe Biden, for example, the non-establishment Bernie part of the Democratic Party has accused the media of taking his side because polling shows that he is the most electable candidate. And yet, here we are with the results in Iowa, showing that despite having everything on his side, including the media behind him, he is coming forth at this point.  And when it comes to moving forward with this campaign, Michael Bloomberg decided not to play in Iowa. And last night, I think that he was looking at the debacle and going this is why I'm not there. And he's been able to buy a lot of his own ads. And he's doubling his staff and continuing to do that.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: -- double the amount of money --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: -- he spent a quarter of a billion dollars and got beat by uncommitted.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Here is the thing to keep in mind. So he is going to double his money right now. What does that say to people in the Democratic side? It says that what he saw last night indicated blood in the water. That he is starting to see an unravelling on the Biden side. He needs Biden out of the way to have a clear lane in the Democratic Party process.  I will say this. To be fair to Joe Biden, Joe Biden's been under attack from Donald Trump from day one. That is what the whole impeachment thing is about, getting dirt on him. And secondly, he didn't intend initially to play in Iowa. His bork (ph), his iron wall is South Carolina. And the key here is if what happened in Iowa and what's likely to happen in New Hampshire, Bernie ahead by a lot there. It's his neighboring state to Vermont.  Does any of this say to voters, especially black voters in South Carolina that, in fact, Joe Biden is not going to get over the finish line? I don't necessarily see anything there to indicate that yet. But that's what's at play at the moment. And with Bloomberg putting more money on the table and getting more support by the minute, I mean, it's really a fascinating moment in terms of American politics.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: You know what Juan is saying is really good point. And I can't believe I said that. I'm kidding, Juan. The irony is that the guy that really screwed over Joe Biden is named Adam Schiff. If Adam Schiff had not pushed this impeachment so much, you wouldn't have had this two month blowback on Biden's kids and Burisma.  PERINO: Yeah.  GUTFELD: So it's all on Schiff.  PERINO: Do we have -- Martha and Bret, I wanted to see if I could bring them back in for a moment to ask a quick question about somebody we haven't even mentioned, which is Elizabeth Warren, coming in third. And then she goes to New Hampshire, of course, that is kind of her neighborhood. She is from Massachusetts. What is she thinking now, Martha, do you wonder?  MACCALLUM: I mean, I think she's got a feel like she got some momentum last night. I think she will feel good about that, because the whole story going into it was that she kind of slipped off the map. The other interesting story that we're kind of looking at developing here as we look at the counties, Dana, is Buttigieg and the counties where he won.  A lot of them are outside of the cities. Sanders' looks like he did very well in Des Moines, Cedar Rapids. We look outside to the more rural areas, and Buttigieg seems to have won those. He spent a lot of time in the 31 counties that were Obama counties and then -- or districts and then became Trump districts. He wanted to try to win those districts back to the Democrat side.  So I think it's going to interesting when we get a really -- a better handle on it. But it looks like in the early indication that those are the areas where he did well. And those are areas I think where Biden had really hoped to do well.  BAIER: I think on Elizabeth Warren, Dana, to your question. Her close was about a unity candidate. And she's going to make that pitch to progressives and say I'm better at closing than Bernie Sanders, as far as head-to-head, and can get the Biden people and maybe even the Buttigieg people on their - - on her side. That was her close in Iowa. I expected it to be her close in New Hampshire. We should point out that these are not final numbers. These are 62 percent, and they could change as we get the rest of the numbers.  MACCALLUM: And just one other thing. Watch Amy Klobuchar because she did, I think, better than most people thought she would And they're -- it's highly possible that she and Biden could flip as you get the final numbers in here. They're very close and these tallies.  PERINO: Let me ask you a question you might not be able to answer. You both went to the lunch today at the White House with President Trump. There's an annual tradition that presidents do right before they give the State of the Union. Is there anything you can tell us about his thoughts about the 2020 election or is that off the table?  BAIER: It was not on the record so we can't get into the quotes about that. I can tell you that he is confident. I think you can see that on the stump and on the campaign.  MACCALLUM: Yes.  BAIER: But he exuded that in a number of different ways.  PERINO: All right. I don't mean to put you on the spot.  MACCALLUM: No, I think you can definitely characterize his mood.  BAIER: But you can characterize it.  MACCALLUM: He was very -- I think he was very confident, brilliant almost, and I think he's also very focused on tomorrow, and he's going to do a speech tomorrow as well after that vote. So I think that was a significant takeaway as well.  GUTFELD: I was there at the lunch and --  PERINO: What did you eat?  GUTFELD: I was serving.  PERINO: Greg, how did the lunch treat you?  GUTFELD: I was actually serving  BAIER: I saw you.  GUTFELD: So I could tell you everything that went on. It was crazy.  BAIER: Thank you for that Splenda.  GUTFELD: A lot of it is about you, Dana. I have to tell you. A lot of stuff behind your back.  WILLIAMS: I tell you what I'm looking for. I can't wait to hear tonight about Space Force. I'm sure that's part of the record. I'm sure that was discussed at the lunch.  PERINO: Well, let me ask -- let me get Jesse Watters in here on something. We saw something today that happened for President Trump. I mean, what a day for it to land. He gets a personal best in the Gallup approval rating at 49 percent. If he does well tonight, you can imagine that in the next couple of weeks, he might hit that 50 percent number. And then the talking point that the Democrats have used against him that he's the only president never to hit 50 percent in his first term, that will go away, too.  WATTERS: And this isn't a Rasmussen poll. This is -- this is Gallup. So, Juan, you can take that one to the bank. And there's a lot of other good material from the Gallup poll. I think Republicans, more Republicans are identified than Democrats for the first time in a while. Independent approval up five points to around 42 percent. And his handling of the economy is well over 60 percent --  PERINO: 63 percent.  WATTERS: 63 percent. So a lot of great numbers to chew on for the President of the United States.1 It does look like the more he prevails over these constant attacks, whether it's Mueller, he prevailed. If you look at impeachment, he's prevailing. The stronger he gets, and it looks like he is on the right side of history, and the Democrats keep coming up empty- handed, and the way they're going about it looks more and more underhanded.  And the economy surging in an election year at this point, he's got the wind in his back. It looks to me like the American people say, I get this guy, there's going to be some chaos, there's going to be some drama. But at the end of the day, I got a big paycheck this past week, things are calm, and we're just going to have to get used to the constant drama, and we have to get used to the president prevailing because he's undefeated when it comes to these coups.  PERINO: Are you getting tired of winning, Jesse?  WATTERS: Not yet.  WILLIAMS: Now, let me just remind you --  GUTFELD: Can I just say --  WILLIAMS: Let me just remind you, these same polls show that half the American people think he should be out of office?  WATTERS: That's not true, Juan. 52-46 against impeachment.  WILLIAMS: I don't know what you're looking at but every poll says it's about 45 to 50 even, beyond 50 in the Fox poll, say this guy should be out of office.  WATTERS: The last three polls, the last three polls show the president should not be impeached.  WILLIAMS: But here's the thing. He's going to talk about oh, this is all I've done tonight. I've done so much. What is he done about health care? I don't know. Where's that wall, Jesse? I don't know.  PERINO: I think though tonight -- Katie, let's talk about that for a moment. The President tonight, they've signaled that they are going to talk about immigration, the safety of the American people. What do you think that he will say tonight on that topic? I know you follow it closely.  PAVLICH: Yes. According to the press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, he'll be talking about the opportunity that America presents, and his eternal optimism for the country, and what America is capable of achieving. Oftentimes, Dana, and you know this, a lot of -- the guests that the First Lady and the President decided to invite and bring to the State of the Union oftentimes show us what he will be discussing and talking about.  He has a border patrol agent on the list coming tonight. He has a veteran who went and served his country in Afghanistan, who then came back, suffered from PTSD, and then became an addict who has now recovered. That goes into their opioid agenda that they've been pushing and been pretty successful at over the past couple of yours. And so those are the things that the President is focusing on.  We have heard he may mention impeachment, and we're hearing a couple of rumblings about how some Democrats may be handling the State of the Union address tonight. We do know that some of them are boycotting and deciding not to show up.  PERINO: Yes. What do you think about that, Greg, about people just saying I'm not going to go?  GUTFELD: I'm not -- I'm actually not surprised, because that's the direction of the Democrats lately. I think what he has to do is he is it out his economic achievements clearly and directly and then ask the public, do you want this to continue or do you want this to end? He needs an analogy of some kind that, you know, imagine the -- imagine the economy is a fully charged phone, right? You hand this phone over to the Democrats, it just turns into a brick. Or you use a pulse or you use a heartbeat, the heartbeat stops the moment you move.  I think that he needs a simple analogy. I also think he has to then pivot from that to how it's going to be even better. But I do think he should address the coronavirus and be very specific about what he's doing. Are we shutting down all the airports keeping China out or not? Because I think that's -- I think it's an important thing to reiterate going into the new year.  PERINO: Jesse, what do you think about the president tonight in a State of the Union Address as he lays out his thoughts for a second term?  WATTERS: Was that addressed to me?  PERINO: Yes.  WATTERS: He hasn't really laid out a second-term agenda. I think to Juan's point earlier, people may say, roll out some sort of hand across the aisle on health care. Obviously, there's more wall to be built. We have I think, about 400 miles completed at the end of this year, supposedly. And -- but I think also, Republicans don't want the President to be running on health care in 2020. So maybe he doesn't get too detailed about that.  I do think he keeps it broad as Greg mentioned on the economic policy, the jobs, and how it's benefited average people and not make a lot of noise at me to that more noise about GDP --  WILLIAMS: But let me just speak -- let me speak to that point.  WATTERS: -- make noise about -- and tell a story about it too.  PERINO: Can I -- can play some sound for you, Juan, to react to? Because I think that if you look at that leaderboard that we have from Iowa, here we have some of the candidates, and this is what they're saying about the economy as it stands today. Let's listen to that, and then we'll get Juan's thoughts.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Tonight has already showed that Americans have a deep hunger for big structural change to make our economy --  PETE BUTTIGIEG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We unifying a rising American majority ready to raise wages and empower workers in this fast-changing economy.  ANDREW YANG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We have to actually make an economy that works for us, instead of the bottom lines of these huge companies.  SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If you are sick and tired of hearing how great the economy is when you don't feel it, I know you, and I will fight for you.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: OK, Juan, you're a historian and you know that there's only twice since World War II that a president has not won a second term, and those two had bad economies. Do you think that the Democrats are effective there in their messaging in saying that the -- that the things that they're feeling about the economy aren't real?  WILLIAMS: Correct. I think they're very successful with this. I think that's what Democrats, it's not the Democratic camps, they're reflecting Democrats in the country. In fact, I think they're reflecting Independents and swing voters in the country. But I think the key point here is one, even as he speaks tonight and claims the you know, to be the savior of the world, guess what, impeachments still hangs over his head.  And when it comes to the economy, when it comes to the economy, it's not like Americans don't know the economy is doing pretty well especially for those at the upper-end Wall Street, big tax breaks for the rich and all --  GUTFELD: The wages are rising for people in the lowest quintile.  WILLIAMS: But I think -- no, it's doing great for the rich but it's not doing great for working people in this country --  WATTERS: That's a stale talking point.  WILLIAMS: Hang on, Jesse --  GUTFELD: But (INAUDIBLE) that makes me feel good.  WILLIAMS: But the problem is this. If you -- if you say the economy is doing well, and I think you cited the Gallup numbers that said Americans know it, a lot of Americans give him credit, they still think he's not the guy to be reelected. Why is that? Because historically, as Dana just said, if the economy is going well, he should be on his way to a cakewalk to reelection, and that's not the case.  PERINO: And I think it shows it that -- I don't think that anyone is thinking that this is going to be an easy election, Jesse. Am I characterizing that correctly?  WATTERS: Listen, I'm not taking anything for granted. Obviously, whoever the Democrat puts out there is going to be highly competitive, and it's going to be dirty, and there's going to be a lot of nasty tricks that the Democrats and the media are going to pull on the president.  I agree with Juan. You don't want to spike the football and say, everyone in America is rich now. Reelect me. Obviously, there are people that are still struggling. Obviously, people are living paycheck to paycheck. But if you look at 2016, I think the average income for middle-class family was like $60,000. It's at $65,000, $6,000 on average, that's a $5,000 raise. You haven't seen that big of a raise for the American middle class since the 90s. And that is a very real thing. And I think the President is going to focus on that.  WILLIAMS: And it's very -- and it's very real, Jesse, to say when he put the tax cut in place, he said this economy was going to take off for the working people.  PERINO: It did.  WILLIAMS: And guess what, all that reinvestment didn't happen. It didn't happen.  WATTERS: What do you think $60,000 a year is, Juan?  PERINO: Katie, let's get your thoughts. Katie, go ahead.  PAVLICH: Juan, people are hiring, people's paychecks are bigger, the economy is doing well. People have had wage increases, which is the Democratic issue. They've been saying, oh, well, the Wall Street's doing well but people's paychecks have remained stagnant. That is no longer the case for Trump has been able to pull off blue-collar workers because of the USMCA. The people complaining about the economy live in big blue cities that have been run by Democrats for decades.  WILLIAMS: How about you Republicans? Hey, didn't you Republicans say the deficits would go away?  PERINO: Let me hold you there. I feel this is really weird being in all these boxes, but I do want to go back to Brit and Martha before we lose them for any sort of last-minute update you have on Iowa or what else you could tell us about that we should be listening for tonight when we hear the President's State of the Union.  BAIER: OK, we'll start there because I think we don't know anymore from Iowa. We have 62 percent. That's all we have. We don't have any other data and they haven't told us when the rest of its coming in. So we are where we are. On the speech tonight, expected to be structured a lot like last State of the Union. There'll be stories woven in there, some surprises as well.  But the fact that the President said it's going to be extraordinarily low key. That's not usually the phraseology that he uses to describe anything he does, but that's how he described it on the record today.  MACCALLUM: Yes. And also, I think it's fair to characterize that he's thinking about tomorrow in terms of wanting to get past that vote, which will happen at 4:00 tomorrow in the Senate, and then he will speak after that. And you know, it almost feels like that is -- it's sort of a two-part speech in my mind. Tonight is going to be the State of the Union, and tomorrow I would look for that to be something like the state of the presidency as he sees it heading into the thick of the election year.  BAIER: And less low key.  PERINO: And may I -- may I jump in here just to tell you that the producers in my ear are telling me that Pete Buttigieg, he's in New Hampshire tonight, as we know, and he has just declared victory in Iowa --  BAIER: Again.  PERINO: Yes, again. I don't know if we have that sound. OK, he's just talking now, but that's basically what he said. And Bret, one of the things that is true in America is possession is nine-tenths of the law. So if you declare victory, do people just think that you're the winner?  BAIER: Yes, I will say this, that it is historic, OK. If you think about this moment, that was pretty much taken from him last night by the Iowa Democratic Party and how they handled it, this is the first gay American man with a husband who is essentially winning a state and the Democratic Party. It is historic.  And the speech that he had written, I think, was a lot like Barack Obama's speech in 2008, which was kind of soaring, and trying to embrace the moment, but it was overtaken by the chaos. And, you know, we'll see if he can catch on in New Hampshire and capitalize on what looks like a really good night in Iowa.  MACCALLUM: And it also says a lot for the way that it feels on the ground, right? There was a lot of energy behind Pete Buttigieg. The people who support him are very enthusiastic, kind of like the way that you saw for President Obama as well. Whether or not it's to the same -- to the same level, I think is another question.  And I just think it's also worth reiterating that it looks like there were people who were maybe going to vote for Joe Biden and who crossed over and voted for Pete Buttigieg because he's seen as sort of a moderate compared to Bernie Sanders. So it looks like he got some of that Biden vote and they're going to have to scramble a bit. I  know they're doing a huge rollout of T.V. ads now in New Hampshire for the Biden campaign. So we'll see if he can register there.  PERINO: All right, Martha and Brett, we appreciate you joining us, helping us out here. I know you've got a busy night ahead of you. I'll see you in a couple of hours for this special coverage.  MACCALLUM: Thanks, guys.  PERINO: Greg, can I come back to you on this idea that the President told the anchors that were assembled there at the lunch that the speech will be long and extraordinarily low key.  GUTFELD: That has to be a prank.  PERINO: Right?  GUTFELD: It has to be a prank because that's -- there's no such thing as a low key Trump. But the thing is, I want to go back to you know, talking about how can somebody be so effective and yet people to have a distaste for him. Trump is a two-hour drive to an hour at the beach. You know, you got to put up with a few bumps and things. When you get there, the beach, the beach looks great.  You don't have to love your boss to know that he is effective. So constantly talking about oh, he's rough, he's obnoxious, everybody has gotten used to that. They've all pretty much moved up. You have wages that are up even in the lower quintiles. You have unemployment for women and minorities at all-time lows. You have peace, you have dead terrorists. You don't have -- you can love those results even if you don't love the guy. No one's expecting you to love him.  PAVLICH: You know, Dana, Speaker Nancy Pelosi is going to be sitting behind President Trump tonight. And going into tonight, I think she's pretty demoralized. She demanded that the Senate call new witnesses. She didn't get that. And then today she was asked by reporters in the hallway about the impeachment vote and going to the State of the Union. And then she immediately turned with Chuck Schumer to talking about the budget. So that's how well impeachment went for Democrats going into tonight.  PERINO: Jesse, can I ask you something about two lines that we heard throughout impeachment, which is, the Democrats kept saying, Donald Trump is going to try to cheat in the election of 2020. And Republicans kept saying that the Democrats are trying to steal an election from us from 2016. And yet then we have this Iowa debacle from last night in which it wasn't cheating or stealing, it was just incompetence. And if people are concerned about the integrity of the vote, like what's next on that front?  WATTERS: Yes, I feel like the Democrats have done a big disservice to the democracy. If you think about in 2016, they accused the president of stealing that election. Now, they're accusing him of stealing 2020, and it hasn't even happened yet. That's like if the San Francisco 49ers said, yes, the Chiefs cheated, and next year, the Chiefs are going to cheat again.  I mean, the Democrats have, like less class than professional football players at this point. And I right now, think about all the bad things that the Democrats have said that have made people think twice about the integrity of the elections. They paid for foreign interference with the dossier. They said Trump and the Russians rigged it. That was a hoax.  People in Georgia, they refuse to concede the election, and now they're mishandling their own caucus. I think it falls on their doorstep for making people question it, not Trump.  PERINO: Juan, a quick thought and then we go -- Juan, quick thought to respond to that and we'll go to a break.  WILLIAMS: Well, even today, when we saw, I think was Senator Collins on the floor. What she said was, yes, he did behave inappropriately, I wouldn't have made the call. This is the consensus now among Republicans. It was inappropriate, but not impeachable.  So Jesse, this idea of corruption, that you say, oh, you know what, the impeachment hurt Biden because Trump was able to convey the ideas that he did, or his son did something wrong. But we don't know. That's exactly right. Right. But what we do know is that Trump did something wrong --  PERINO: We don't know that.  WILLIAMS: We don't know that. That's exactly right. But what we do know is that Trump did something wrong even among -- even according to Republicans. And believe me, that corruption, that effort to get dirt on Biden, that was an effort to corrupt the 2020 election.  WATTERS: Susan Collins has the consensus for Republicans --  PERINO: I'm sorry you guys. They're asking me. Can we just take a quick break? We're going to be right back -- you know, they got to figure out a way to make a quick break, but we got to come back with all of these five people in just a moment.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PERINO: We have a little bit more FIVE for you. The Iowa Democratic Party just released some of the Iowa caucus results, 62 percent of the results. It comes after that long delay. And here's some of the media reaction to that.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's been chaos here in Des Moines.  JOE SCARBOROUGH, HOST, MSNBC: This is a disaster on every level for Democrats and for Iowa.  CHRIS MATTHEWS: A complete chaos and disaster.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The phone backup system that they had in place, according to one source is a disaster.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They can't response, so they're just starting to tweet out their results. This is starting to look like a debacle.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's staggeringly embarrassing and really unacceptable.  SCARBOROUGH: Was there election interference? Did somebody tried to hack into the app? Was it just pure incompetence?  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If it wasn't the Russians in this case, it appears to be the Democrats who have did it to themselves.  MATTHEWS: The guy in the White House is chuckling all night here showing the Democrats can't even get a three-car funeral organized.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: Greg, it was like so obvious that the Democrats in Iowa had screwed this up that even the media was like, we got to call them out.  GUTFELD: It must be so -- this reminds me of 2016 in a way that they realize that they can't say or do anything and all they do is seek out the best adjectives from the thesaurus. Remember, it takes a lot to see something really embarrassing on the Democrat side because of the Democrat apparatus which is protected by the media apparatus.  At this point, because the Democratic apparatus imploded, the media was a shell, so you could see the awfulness for what it was. However, if you're Republican, that stuff -- and you've screw up, it's out before it even happens.  WATTERS: I know. Everything the media has said so far has been wrong. Biden, this big Mr. Electability looks like fourth place.  PERINO: Well, that was he was saying.  WATTERS: But I mean, the media propped this guy up like this guy was, oh, the only reason that Donald Trump is going after Biden is because he's so scared of Joe Biden. Every time Joe Biden has run for president, he's failed. The only time he was successful was in Delaware, a state like this big, and when he was riding Obama's coattails.  PERINO: Hey, don't make fun of small states. Come on.  WATTERS: I'm sorry. No, size doesn't matter when it comes to states.  PERINO: Size doesn't matter when it comes to state.  WATTERS: Also, Mayor Pete, what an amazing job. He spent a fortune in Iowa --  PERINO: I was going to mention something about him.  WATTERS: -- and he's been on the ground there, very well organized. You really, really got to give Mayor Pete a lot of credit.  PERINO: And we do. And I wanted to mention this because I'm sorry I'm looking at my phone, but that's how I'm getting information right now. This is for Katie, and then, Juan. Lis Smith who is a communications director for Pete Buttigieg's campaign just tweets this. ""The Web site is currently getting the most traffic we have recorded on any day in this campaign."" And it says, #phasefour. So, they're declaring victory and moving on.  PAVLICH: Yes, leading up to the Iowa caucuses I think that the Pete -- Mayor Pete Campaign did a pretty good job of not lowering expectations but not going overboard and saying that we're going to win. They said that we look to do well, and Pete Buttigieg did that town hall with Chris Wallace and said, look, we're going to do the best that we can.  So I'm not surprised that people are a little bit surprised, shocked. And now they're going to find out who this guy is, what his platform stands for. And according to a lot of the people on the ground in Iowa, they weren't actually sure about his background. So now people are interested.  PERINO: It's pretty interesting. And I also just got a statement from Jeff Weaver. He is a senior adviser to Bernie Sanders. Juan, let me ask you to respond to this. He says we want to thank the people of Iowa. We are gratified that in the partial data release so far, it's clear that in the first and second round, more people voted for Bernie than any other candidate in the field. So trying to make that popular vote argument.  WILLIAMS: Well, the popular vote does matter. In fact, you know, you could argue that that's what they should do. They should stop with the whole caucus concept maybe in Iowa and just go to the popular vote. Just report it out straight. Let people know how the people of Iowa decide on an individual basis, and maybe even let the state count it.  Most places in America, the state does the counting, but in the caucus system, it's the party that does the counting. And as I said earlier, going back to 2012, we've seen Republicans not do so well with it. This time, an absolute disaster for the Democrats.  But I just want to speak to the media point. When the media criticizes Democrats, you guys say oh, well, now the media finally woke up. But when you criticize Republicans, you say, oh, it's unfair media. I don't get it. What an inconsistency.  PERINO: Yes, you see how that works, Juan?  WILLIAMS: Yes, I get how it works now.  WATTERS: I'll give you an example. I'll give you an example. When you have a colossal mistake, there's nowhere to hide, they have to criticize them.  WILLIAMS: I see. Well, I think a lot of what Trump does are colossal mistakes and I sit next to you, Jesse, and I hear you defend it.  PERINO: You have somebody like Mayor Pete who came out against the Electoral College. He wants to abolish the Electoral College, and yet he is making an argument that because under the rules, he actually can claim victory in Iowa because he's saying that under those rules, it's like the Electoral College, and Bernie Sanders is saying, but I won the popular vote.  WATTERS: Well, I mean, the rules to me look like a pyramid scheme. No one - - regular American understands these new Iowa caucus rules.  PERINO: They're difficult to understand.  WATTERS: I do know this. It's not winner take all. So a couple people, maybe what is it, the top three or four going to split the 40 delegates at Iowa, so they all have like a little tiny handful of delegates going into New Hampshire. And then out in New Hampshire, same thing, not winner take all. Each snatch a little handful of delegates. So this is why this primary is going to take forever, and no one is going to be a clear winner.  GUTFELD: Hey, can I add one think to this?  WILLIAMS: Well, I just want to make one quick point about what we're going to see with Mayor Pete. I think that still I'd be interested but I'd think that you're still going to see Sanders do very well in New Hampshire.  PERINO: Yes. Well, he won New Hampshire in 2016.  WILLIAMS: Right. And the question then becomes about South Carolina. Mayor Pete has very little support on South Carolina, especially among black voters.  WATTERS: But don't they go to Nevada?  PERINO: But maybe people will give him another look now. I mean, it's possible that that will happen that, Katie, young people may be trying to convince their parents or their grandparents to look at a younger generation.  PAVLICH: There is -- last night, there was video of a young man trying to convince his dad to switch his boat from Joe Biden to Mayor Pete. So that was certainly going on. But in terms of the --  PERINO: It might happen.  PAVLICH: It might happen. But going -- you know, Juan keeps talking about South Carolina. There was a new poll that came out this week showing that Joe Biden actually only has 30 percent of black support now. He's at 25 percent, and Bernie Sanders got 20 percent. We still have a very long way to go before we get to South Carolina, and it doesn't seem like the Biden campaign is capable of making its own momentum. And certainly, they don't have a movement like Bernie or Pete does.  PERINO: Well, Juan and I have been on the road for so long. We feel like we've been on that very long road. Greg, are you going to be live-tweeting the speech tonight? Can we look forward to that?  GUTFELD: I will be on Tucker tonight to talk about some stuff.  PERINO: Wow.  GUTFELD: But you know what I find most interesting about the real support for Bernie Sanders is that here you have the Democrats who despise the Russian influence, but they're voting for a guy who loves the Soviet system. So it's like -- I don't -- does anybody ever pointed that out? Isn't that weird?  PERINO: Yes. I think that there's a big -- a big old bucket of opposition research that the Democrats have been holding on to, Jesse, that's about to be dumped somewhere.  WILLIAMS: Well, this why he's Trump's -- he's Trump's pick for the Democrats. He sees an easy -- what I call a tomato can, easily bloody.  WATTERS: OK, well then, they're all cans of tomatoes then, Juan.  WILLIAMS: Oh yes, no, no, no. Remember, you look at those same polls. They're all -- they're all beating Trump.  WATTERS: Polls, polls, polls, Juan.  WILLIAMS: A minute ago you love that latest poll on Trump.  WATTERS: Yes. See how that works? I just -- I just read a letter that some Soviet official sent to Bernie Sanders when he won the mayoral race in Burlington, Vermont. And that is at the height of the Cold War. So you're already starting to see the anti-Bernie oppo drop.  PAVLICH: You know, Dana, last night I was thinking when they were complaining about not being able to report the results, the Bernie folks, it was interesting considering that they are now complaining about waiting in lines since Bernie Sanders said bright lines and countries were a good sign of economic growth. Apparently, it's a problem now.  PERINO: Well, Juan and I will be there -- will be here watching the speech all together. We will be back with you in New York tomorrow. It would be good to be back at the table.  GUTFELD: I'm in your seat, Dana. I'm sitting on your chair.  PERINO: Are you using my pillows? All right. Thanks, everybody. That is it for us. Set your DVRs. Please, please, never miss an episode of THE FIVE. I mean, how could you miss this? We just gave you everything that you needed to know as a great catch up.

Jennifer Lopez and Shakira’s Super Bowl halftime performance is getting a lot of attention. Many agreed Shakira-Lo was amazing. You had two famous beautiful women, both superbly athletic, dancing their hearts out. And you had a ton of back-up dancers and little clothing. In fact, the “dancer to clothing” ratio was 50:1.

90,FOX,"Candidate make final push ahead of caucuses; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" February 3, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST: Hello, everybody. I'm Jesse Watters, along with Katie Pavlich, Juan Williams, Dana Perino, and Greg Gutfeld. It is 5:00 in New York, 4:00 in Iowa, and this is ""The Five."" The battle for 2020 officially kicks off with the Iowa caucuses just a few hours from now. The Hawkeye state could prove to be a pivotal moment in the Democratic race. The party's establishment is bracing for a Bernie Sanders surge, while Sleepy Joe Biden's allies are preparing for the worst. Here is the top candidates making their final pitches. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PETE BUTTIGIEG, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Happy caucus day. You are part of an absolute force that is sweeping to the state of Iowa right now. JOE BIDEN, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Feeling good. There's a lot of energy out there. There's a lot of enthusiasm. I've been to a lot of counties all over the county, all over the state, and it feels good. SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN, D-MASS., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Commit today to caucus for me. Agree to do phone calls. Knock on doors. SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Tomorrow night is the beginning. It is the beginning of the end for Donald Trump. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: While Democrats battle it out in Iowa, President Trump continues to steal the spotlight. And there is growing concern among the party that 2020 candidates don't stand a chance against Trump, especially when facing attacks like these. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm watching. I have, you know, I have little nicknames for all of them, but -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm sure they love your nicknames. TRUMP: But they are accurate. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let's start with Joe Biden. TRUMP: I just think of sleepy. I just watch him. He's Sleepy, Sleepy Joe. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hunter, Hunter Biden. TRUMP: Where is Hunter? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Bernie Sanders. TRUMP: Well, I think he's a communist. You mentioned now Elizabeth Warren. I call her fairytale, because everything's a fairytale. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: All right. Juan Williams, so you're not -- what have you heard -- what are you seeing out there -- where do you see the energy leading to if you can give us a sense of that? JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Well, the polls -- and a lot of people are just saying they assume that Bernie Sanders comes out on top here, Jesse. But it's by three to five points at best. And so you're going to still see Joe Biden right there. And then behind that you get Pete Buttigieg coming in, maybe a little farther down. And the questions of the night have to do with Amy Klobuchar, the Senator from neighboring Minnesota. How will she do? And there's a lot of pessimism. And I was surprised to hear this about Elizabeth Warren, Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts. But as you know, she for a while had really surged. And now, it looks like this is Bernie Sanders' surge at just the right moment. And it could be crushing for Elizabeth Warren. WATTERS: Yes. I mean, she had the Medicare for All problem, Dana. She was kind of out of commission in Washington, D.C. for the last two weeks. And then played the victim card against Bernie, and she's looking like she's tailing off a little bit. Do you agree with Juan that it's kind of a two- person race now in Iowa between Biden and Bernie? DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Not -- I don't there I'm quite there yet, but think anybody, including all of us here who think that we know what's going to happen tonight. We don't. The rules changed since the last time around in 2016. There's a new threshold you have to hit at 15 percent. And then it goes to a second bout in alignment, and it's a little bit confusing. I think that the end result tonight could be fairly muddled, or you could see Bernie Sanders do really quite well. I think that Mayor Pete or even Andrew Yang could do well here. They have a lot of enthusiasm from young people. Don't forget Amy Klobuchar who really campaigned really hard in the rural areas. She could possibly do well. But I think for Liz Warren, if she doesn't do well here and Bernie Sanders does, and he goes to New Hampshire the king again. I think it'll be really interesting to see what she decides to do. Does she continue or does she just behind him? WATTERS: Yeah. I mean, if I were running against Bernie Sanders, I'd say you already admitted that you're going to raise taxes, Katie, on the middle tax. I don't know whey they're not doing that. Can I play a sound bite of one of your favorite people? Chris Matthews on MSNBC, this is his interpretation of the field. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What are my thoughts on that happening? I'm not happy with this field. I think they got to find a candidate for president who can beat Trump. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And you don't think anybody in this field could beat -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm still looking. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Still looking. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What's the problem? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Obvious problems. They're all problems. Bernie's Sanders is not going to be president of the United States. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Wow. KATIE PAVLICH, CO-HOST: Yeah. I was thinking today about all the people who haven't made it to the Iowa caucuses. Beto was supposed to be the next Obama, who totally had this big moment and was on the front of Vanity Fair and then fizzled out. Kamala Harris, she kept saying I'm going to move to Iowa. That did not happen. So it's really hard to gauge what's going on in the ground. Polling is notoriously difficult in Iowa. But Bernie Sanders has been here before. And he doesn't want to lose again. So he's been able to learn from maybe some of the mistakes or the things that they didn't do last time and really get out there and knock on doors. And I think Elizabeth Warren is, today in this point, if she does not do well, which I don't think she will double in New Hampshire or Iowa. She'll probably drop out. And Joe Biden, look, they've been saying forever that it doesn't matter if he wins Iowa. It doesn't matter if he wins New Hampshire. They are banking South Carolina to get him through. That's an interesting strategy. And their excuses for losing if that happens tonight will be interesting to pay attention to if they change their strategy -- (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: Yeah, setting expectations pretty low. All right, Greg, I know you are going to be watching the caucuses tonight. GREG GUTFELD, CO- HOST: Oh, like a hawk. WATTERS: Like a hawk. GUTFELD: I'll be Hawkcus on the caucus. PAVLICH: Iowa Hawkeye's. WATTERS: What do think about Iowa? Are you excited? GUTFELD: Well, first of all, you are welcome, America. This is the day after the Super Bowl when 60 percent of The Five are hung over, unlike the 18 million people who decided not to show up for work. We're here because we love you, even though I'm holding on to this table praying that I make it through without vomiting on Jesse's nice suit. All right, here's the interesting thing about this thing that -- what Chris Wallace is talking about. A lot of interesting people are not running. They are not participating. So this cruise seems very weak and bland. It reminds me of -- when you were a kid and your parents bought that variety set of breakfast cereals. WATTERS: I loved those. GUTFELD: Those were great for vacation. But by the end of the first week, all that was left was Special K and Bran Flakes, always Special K, right, weird box. And everything from Frosted Flakes to Apple Jacks, they were gone. Well, the problem with this field, it is all Bran Flakes and Special K. Especially Mayor Pete. Here's another anal -- you know, Mayor Pete is great when he's around others because he seems interesting. He's like a great secondary character in a TV show. But when they decide to spin him off, he is a flop? So you remember how much you love Joey on Friends. He was great. But you didn't watch Joey, did you? Would Joey die on the vine because it wasn't the same without Rachel or Ross? And the thing is without other people to compare him to it's not going to happen. As for Bernie, we've been talking about Bernie for a long time. And I call this the pendulum. The populace inferno that took over 2016 is now swinging back to the left. All these things are cyclical, right? So we have the populist inferno that brought in Trump. The populist inferno, same mentality, could bring Bernie into the White House. So when I hear this sentiment by Chris Matthews that it'll never happen, they -- I said that about Trump. I was wrong, I shouldn't have listened -- never mind. WATTERS: You are very good the day after the Super Bowl. GUTFELD: You know why, because I'm crying inside, Jesse. WATTERS: OK. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: I only disagree with you on one thing, though. I would say the never-Bernie movement is 10 times stronger than the never-Trump movement. And you can see the never-Bernie movement already pulling out all the stops with, you know, reinvigorating the power of the super delegates, letting the rules change so Bloomberg can come in, Hillary coming out of nowhere to drop bombs on Bernie. I just think Bernie has a lot coming if he wins Iowa and New Hampshire. PERINO: I don't know if you can hear me, Jesse. But I absolutely -- I think that that's very true. Because it's not just about a difference in style, right or difference in, like, rhetoric or demeanor or civility. It's a complete departure from a lot of things that we hold dear in America. And I think that from a policy standpoint, the enthusiasm for a Bernie candidacy. He'll have his people. And he'll have this 40 percent, but I don't think the rest of the Democratic Party will enthusiastically get behind him. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: -- in 2016, the Republican establishment was so anti-Trump and did not think Trump could beat the Democrats. PERINO: But that was a lot more about style than it was about policy. What President Trump was -- as a candidate wasn't talking about a whole sale departure of the American way of life. WATTERS: Right. And I still think Bernie has only has 20 percent of the Democratic field. I don't think he's a majority type of candidate. But you know, we're going to talk about this later in the show, aren't we? I think we are. We're going to talking about it later. All right, coming up, the impeachment trial is just about a done deal, but Democrats aren't finished going after the president. What they are planning to do next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WILLIAMS: Welcome back to Iowa. We're getting some brand-new numbers from the Fox News voter analysis. Iowa Democrats saying the most important issue facing the country is healthcare. That tops the economy and jobs. We're going to keep an eye on that. Meanwhile, it's a jam-packed week in Washington, the impeachment trial continuing today while President Trump gets ready to deliver his state of the union address tomorrow. And on Wednesday, the final vote on impeachment is set, where President Trump is expected to be acquitted. Regardless of the outcome, Democrats say they will keep investigating this president, impeachment manager, Adam Schiff is saying he has no regrets with how things have played out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm not letting the senators off the hook. We're still going to go into the Senate this week and make the case why this president needs to be removed. It will be up to the senators to make that final judgment, and the senators will be held accountable for it. There is nothing that I can see that we could've done differently, because as the senators have already admitted, we proved our case. We proved our case. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: Meanwhile, 2020 candidate Joe Biden getting into a heated exchange with NBC's Savannah Guthrie over a question about his son. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you think it was wrong for him to take that position, knowing that it was really because that company wanted access to you? BIDEN: Well, that's not true. You are saying things. You do not know what you're talking about. No one said that. Who said that? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Don't you think that it's just one of those things where people think, well, that seems kind of sleazy. Why would he have that job if not for who his father was? BIDEN: He's a very bright guy. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: Jesse, I wanted to start with the statement from Adam Schiff that he has no regrets about how things have played out, even though acquittal, I would say, is a certainty tomorrow. WATTERS: He has to say that, but I'm sure he regrets it. I mean, if they had done it properly and not started it out in a secret basement with no lawyers present, maybe it would've gone differently. Maybe they would've built a stronger case. Maybe they would've gone to a judge to compel witness testimony, and maybe delivered the Senate -- might've taken a few months longer. But maybe they would've handed it off to the Senate a better case that they could have argued in a more convincing fashion. But they wanted to do a rush job to fit a political calendar. They didn't really care about making a really strong Constitutional case. So they can continue to investigate the president all they want. And the Republicans can investigate the whistle-blower. Lindsey Graham says he's going to call the whistle-blower after this whole thing is done to testify about what went down in the Senate Intelligence Committee. So two can play at that game, and I think everyone has just turned the page at this point. WILLIAMS: But Dana, what Schiff is saying is he feels he did make the case. You've heard that even some Republicans say they feel he's made the case. And he feels that this is now in the forefront, the Trump corruption of the American political mind. PERINO: But they still lost, so acquittal is a loss. And whoever wins in a fight like this gets to write the history. President Trump is like -- remember in Pac-Man you go along ding, ding, ding, and then you eat the fruit, and you get bigger and stronger and you get another man? Like, that's President Trump, like, what's happening because of impeachment. And earlier today, Senator Manchin, just like within the last hour on the floor of the Senate. He's the Democrat from West Virginia who thought about maybe voting with the Republicans on acquittal. And he said maybe we should just do a censure vote, because censure basically is like, please, Mr. President, don't ever do that again. That was very bad. But I don't see any Republicans -- why would they go along with that now? That was a tool that the Democrats had at their disposal for months. And they decided not to use it because they bent to the will of the progressives. They went all out. They went for broke on impeachment. And they lost. I don't think that the Republicans should cave and then censure after all of this. WILLIAMS: Right. Katie, the other way of looking at this is you still have about half of the country. In fact, there are some polls, more than half the country that not only supports impeachment but removal. And Schiff is saying I'm not going to let the Republicans off the hook. Let them defend this. What do you think? PAVLICH: Well, first, I think it goes back to the poll that you said at the top of the segment. And that Americans care about other issues, more importantly like healthcare and the economy. So I don't think that when you ask a question about whether it's a priority, people would say that impeachment should continue to be something that senators and Congress focus on. But I think if you take it and look at the history of the impeachment process, all of the momentum in this has gone towards President Trump. There is a bipartisan vote against in the House. You have Joe Manchin who may vote for acquittal. We don't know. But, you know, coming out and saying that the House didn't necessarily give them everything that they needed to hear everything. And then also, you know, you look at the strategy of Adam Schiff. You can argue that he was never really interested in impeaching and removing the president, because he knew right away that the Senate would never vote to convict and remove him, but this is all about 2020 turning the Senate over to Chuck Schumer, which he then reiterated by saying, well, the senators we held accountable for that. He's talking about elections, which this was all about from the beginning. WILLIAMS: Yeah. I think that's smart. But, you know, Greg, what did you think of that little set between Savannah Guthrie and Joe Biden? You think -- who came out on top on that one? GUTFELD: Well, I think Joe in his head thinks he's Clint Eastwood in Gran Torino. But everybody else, he's one of the old guys from the Muppets. So here's the deal with the impeachment, OK? You have you ever played checkers against somebody and you beat them really, really badly, and then they go, well, let's play two out of three? And then you beat them with two out of three. And then they go let's do three out of five. WATTERS: That's my line. GUTFELD: That's Adam Schiff. Adam Schiff will not -- so the -- so Dana understands my theory, I call it the Law and Order affect. The impeachment is his like reruns of Law and Order. Before one is over, start up another one, and hope that nobody notices it so you never change the channel. And you end up on the sofa from morning till evening. So what Democrats are going to with impeachment, they're going to keep it running, so they are like Law and Order reruns. And they'll become as mundane as like living next to an airport. We know we used to think planes are interesting. Now you just say it's another plane. WATTERS: You guys are amazing for the day after the Super Bowl. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: I'm just going to sit here and shut up. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: -- extra energy. All right, the battle of the billionaires is ramping up, as President Trump and Mike Bloomberg lob new insults, fresh material at each other. We're going to show it to you here on The Five. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PERINO: More data coming in from Fox News voter analysis, 70 percent of Iowa Democrats said they favor single payer government run healthcare. We'll keep you posted as the information comes in. In the meantime, the battle of the billionaires is turning nasty. President Trump and Michael Bloomberg have taken shots at each other over the past couple of days. Here is the president poking fun at who he likes to call Mini-Mike. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: Very little. I just think of little. You know now he wants a box for the debates to stand on. OK, it's OK. There's nothing wrong. You can be short. Why should he get a box to stand on, OK? He wants a box for the debates. Why should he be entitled for that, really? Does that mean everyone else gets a box? (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: Mike Bloomberg reportedly fuming over the repeated attacks on his height and plotting his revenge. His campaign is responding by mocking Trump's hair and tan, Greg, as if that is not something that people have come up with before. GUTFELD: OK. Number one, we were talking about this in the break. There's something brilliant about the fact that the question isn't is there a box. The question is, is it fair that he has a box and other people don't? So he's done this thing called moving past the sale. So the question -- we're not going like is there really a box or really not a box. We are talking about the fairness of a box, which shows you the kind of persuasive trickery he's involved. And then he utilizes the media like a t-shirt cannon. He puts this visual message on the shirt, Bloomberg on a box. And then he fires it into the media, and then you have half the media, CNN who falls for it and writes, you know, there is no box, and they get all freaked out. We are just sitting here laughing at it, because we know that this is the show. And this is how the show works. And getting the media riled up, mission accomplished. That's all he is trying to. PERINO: So Juan, big question is whether the DNC is trying to kind of move things around so that Joe Biden fails as the establishment candidate, the moderate that they can bring in someone like Mike Bloomberg. WILLIAMS: Wow. Well, first, can I respond to Gregory? PERINO: Sure. WILLIAMS: I just want to say -- I want to say, Greg at least I know where the Kansas City Chiefs play football. I know what state it is. I think there's somebody on the Republican side in the White House that thinks it is Kansas? GUTFELD: It's not in Kansas? Is it not in Kansas? (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: It's a split city. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: Yeah. WILLIAMS: Did you hear what Ms. Perino said? GUTFELD: You know when you have to change the argument, you've lost the argument. WILLIAMS: Oh, no. Let me go back to Katie. So Katie, restate the question. PAVLICH: The question is Bloomberg going to be a substitute for Joe Biden that Biden can't pull it off? WILLIAMS: Oh, well, I think that's not something that we -- right now, Joe Biden hasn't imploded -- for all the attacks that have come from President Trump. That has not happened. But I do see that the president is punching down at Mike Bloomberg, and I think unintentionally elevated Mike Bloomberg. PERINO: Juan, are you calling Mike Bloomberg short? WILLIAMS: That's a clever (ph) retort, but I must say that's not what I meant. What I meant was that he's the president of the United States, and Mike Bloomberg is not really a -- he's not even in Iowa today. He's not running ads in Iowa. And the president's attention is giving more oxygen to Mike Bloomberg's candidacy. PAVLICH: OK. So Dana, I want to play Michael Moore. Having a reaction to the DNC changing the rules and then we'll get you -- (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The DNC will not allow Cory Booker on that stage, will not allow Julian Castro on that stage, but they are going to allow Mike Bloomberg on the stage because he's got a billion (bleep) dollars! (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Wow. PAVLICH: Dana? PERINO: Well, the thing is -- I mean, I hate to break it to him. But there were the rules that were spelled out by the DNC in the beginning. Tom Perez, who head of the DNC, had said that there was two thresholds leading up to the votes until votes started. So you had to hit a certain polling number and you have to have a certain number of donors across the country until the voting started. What's happening tonight? The voting is starting. And so what the DNC has done is they've been true to their word, as I read it. That threshold number for the polling is going to remain, but the donor one that goes away. So I think -- I can understand, like, using it to be -- to complain about it. But I actually don't think that Michael Moore is accurate here. PAVLICH: Jesse, your response? (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: Yeah, I want to talk about the box. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: I don't think there is a box, but I can't stop thinking about the box. GUTFELD: There you go. WATTERS: Is it wood? Is it steel? What is he look like when he steps on it? What does he look like if he doesn't? Does his -- does his head go above the podium without a box? The thing is Trump just started a rumor. It's a rumor that he started and then the media just runs with it. And they're doing the dirty work for them. All we know is this is what he does. He accuses an opponent of having a shortcoming, then the media reports about the opponent having the shortcoming, and then the opponent denies that he has a shortcoming, but the whole time we're talking about the shortcoming. PAVLICH: Do you want to talk about short if you say that word one more time? WATTERS: No. And I did mean that, Juan. PAVLICH: So my follow up question to you real quickly is OK, if Michael Bloomberg gets the boxes, is the press -- is Trump going to say well, then I get a box at my debate? WATTERS: It is unfair if he has a box. PAVLICH: It is unfair. WATTERS: Unfair. PAVLICH: OK. GUTFELD: Box inequality. PAVLICH: Rules apply to everybody, I guess. All right, moving on. It's a Super Bowl halftime performance the whole country is talking about. Up next, Greg's monologue on Jennifer Lopez and Shakira stealing show. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GUTFELD: Welcome back. J. Lo and Shakira Super Bowl halftime performance is getting a lot of attention, so let's play a clip, shall we? Many agreed. Shakira-Lo was amazing. You got two famous beautiful women both the superbly athletic dancing their hearts out, and yet a ton of backup dancers and little clothing. In fact, the dancer to clothing ratio was 50 to one. For every 50 dancers, there was only one pair of pants. So what's not to love? Well, maybe some of the stripper inspired moves were inappropriate for family viewing, meaning kids, things I don't have, thank God. But the media gets two bites on this apple. First to say it's empowering, because that's the word of the day. Second, to mock parents of kids who might have found a woman's legs spread, pressing her fingers against her, you know what. It's not exactly family fare. But hey, that's modern entertainment today. It's not one morality fits all. And if you don't like it that's on you. The media prefers the prison of two ideas. Either you love it, or you're a sexist who hates empowerment. But factually, you can find it entertaining, but just not for kids. Maybe people should keep that in mind. Or we could just assume that culture has changed so much, it's Doesn't matter what the breath see, right? As for empowerment, some men embrace it for it gets women to believe that empowerment matters more than scruples. You can conquer sexism by eliminating restraint. Harvey Weinstein loved empowerment. You know how many times did he say, you go girl, then adding to my room? All right, I'm going to show it but let's just show a picture of bad bunny. You know, bad bunny was there, right? He's the rapper. Yes, there he is. That's me. I'm not that bunny. There he is. All right, I have a question for you. Isn't it sexist, Dana, that he gets to be fully clothed, but the performers don't? Isn't that sexist? PERINO: No, I'm going to say no. I think that everyone had a choice on what they got to wear, right? So if he had a choice, and he decided to dress like that, then that was his choice. That's not sexist. GUTFELD: All right. WATTERS: Did you want to see Bad Bunny with a shirt off Greg? GUTFELD: I want equal opportunity nudity. PAVLICH: If I'd be Bad Bunny, I would not want to compete with J. Lo and Shakira. GUTFELD: Yes. PAVLICH: Like I'm putting my clothes on and I'm not even going to try. GUTFELD: They are -- they are -- Katie, they are in phenomenal shape, especially J-Lo, incredible, incredible shape. I think the stripper pole added a lot to this performance. I'm sure children were going, I want one. PAVLICH: Well, it takes a lot of practice to actually be able to do what J. Lo did, so do it supervised, I would say. I'm not in the prison of two ideas. I am -- I thought that was -- they both had amazing talent. I've been a longtime fan of both of their music. I could have used with a little less touching of the ""you know what"" parts. But I love that J. Lo had her daughter come on stage and sing with her. GUTFELD: Yes. PAVLICH: That was amazing, and I love the American flag, so that was great. So there you go. GUTFELD: There you go. I think -- oh, there's also the Puerto Rican flag, so it's a dual flag Katie. PAVLICH: It's part of America. GUTFELD: I didn't -- I forgot the part where she was with her kid. Did she put on more clothes where -- PAVLICH: She did put on a more -- had more coverage when her daughter came on to sing with her. So that was interesting. GUTFELD: I didn't say -- OK. PAVLICH: That was my observation. GUTFELD: Juan, what did you think? You were actually at the game with Jesse? How did you feel? WILLIAMS: That was great. It was -- it was fabulous. Let me just say, we don't appreciate the fact that they had a light show, they had fireworks, they had American military jets going overhead, and then the costumes were just amazing coordinating. Sometimes you can't see it, but the stage itself was lighting and doing things. I just -- I was -- I was just taken with it. I will say I thought it was a little racy if the kids were up to see the second half. I don't know but I got to agree with you. I think, you know, every generation says oh, look at this latest music, look at this Elvis, look at this folk protest music, look at this rock, look at this rap, it's going to ruin the country. No, this is America. That was a great show with a strong Latin influence. GUTFELD: And -- but a lot of crotch-grabbing. And I don't know if that's like the next step. WATTERS: Yes, I mean when that happened, Juan spilled his beer all over himself. PERINO: Oh, Lord, here we go. WILLIAMS: Wet, wet pants. GUTFELD: The first -- the first Super Bowl halftime show, I looked it up, had two marching bands. It's like I guess 1967. Two marching bands, and trumpeter Al Hirt, two men in jetpacks, and 300 pigeons. WATTERS: Wow. Did Al Hirt have his shirt up, Greg? GUTFELD: Yes, he did. WATTERS: I don't know. I mean, well, we've come a long way. I just think that if you know Fox booked Shakira and J. Lo for the halftime show, you know, it's going to be like this. So if you have kids at home, send them to the basement during halftime. GUTFELD: What if you're in the West Coast and you don't have a basement? WATTERS: OK, send them outside. It's probably 60 degrees out. I don't know. I mean, I thought it was fine. And you know, I remember -- I just -- there's a lot of hypocrites out there who say, I don't like -- you know, I know who these people are. GUTFELD: Are you talking about me? WATTERS: And I know what they do in their personal life. PAVLICH: Oh no. WATTERS: They're not offended by girls dancing at a football game. GUTFELD: Are you talking about me? WATTERS: No, but some other people. Just some other people out there. GUTFELD: You know, I just like to be the moral conscience of America. WATTERS: Yes, Greg. GUTFELD: Somebody has to do it, right? WATTERS: Yes, that's you. GUTFELD: It's not you, Jesse. WATTERS: Definitely not me. GUTFELD: All right. Next up, countdown to the Iowa caucuses continues on THE FIVE. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PERINO: It feels like a long time coming. It's a big day for the 2020 Democrats as Iowans prepared a caucus tonight. And here to help us break down the latest numbers from the Fox News voter analysis and preview tonight's special coverage are Martha McCallum and Bret Baier, of course, two of our favorites there. They are looking great out there. Martha, what do we know so far? MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Well, we're starting to get you know, some early feel for how some of this might shape up tonight. But everybody's on their way to these caucus centers at this point. And it looks like it's going to be very interesting. I think that's something that we can safely say at this point. I think a lot of people are fluid and willing to change their minds as they head into these caucuses. BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: You know, Dana, at the beginning of the show, you said something that I think is perfect because nobody knows how this is going to go. And that's the nature of these caucuses is that -- PERINO: That's another one of my bold predictions. BAIER: Yes, I mean, really, really nail it because -- MACCALLUM: One of the teams will win. BAIER: Especially caucuses because, you know, you don't know who's going to show up. You don't know how persuasive the different teams are going to be once they're in the room and saying, come on over to our side. And it's all about reaching that viability, which is 15 percent in each precinct, and it's all about ground game and organization. PAVLICH: And we're going to take it around the table -- MACCALLUM: So once they get that 15 percent -- you know, I just wanted to say, you know, I was watching actually one of the early satellite ones coming in from Paris, and another one from Florida, and it's just fascinating to watch. You know, then they're counting how many people are in each corner, which we all know is the way that this works. But then, you know, somebody was shouting from the back. No, no, that wasn't 37. It was actually 38 of us over here in this corner. So I think it's going to be -- there's going to be a lot of moving parts tonight. PERINO: We're seeing some of these returns on the Fox News voter analysis come in. Health care is way up there and single-payer getting a 70 percent rating they're. Like -- but of course, as you know, I always wonder what would they say if there was a follow-up question. Let's go to Jesse Watters. Do you have a question for either of these two fine anchors who are here? WATTERS: I do. I have on my hands these voter analysis statistics here. Very interesting about voter contact. It looks like the Sanders campaign has contacted about 80 percent of Iowa Democrats with the Warren and Mayor Pete campaigns a close second and third. But the Biden campaign only contacted about half of Iowa Democrats. That speaks to, I guess, his lack of organization and the great organization from the Bernie Sanders people. BAIER: Yes. I think what we don't know, Jesse, is how effective those contacts are and how well you know, just by reaching out somebody on the phone, how that motivates somebody to go to the caucus or not. But Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, actually Pete Buttigieg also had a really great ground game here in Iowa. And over the next two hours, we'll see good. MACCALLUM: But just because somebody calls you on behalf of a candidate doesn't necessarily mean that you agree with them. WATTERS: Yes. I mean, if Bernie called me, I could just hang up. That's a voter contact. MACCALLUM: That's your prerogative. PERINO: That's your contact. All right, Juan Williams, a question here? WILLIAMS: Well, it's clear that healthcare is on everybody's mind in Iowa and I think nationally, although the poll, just to repeat, is of Iowa Democrats. So I just thought I'd throw out there to Bret, you know, if you see public option at 80 percent, single-payer at 70, what does that say to Republicans, I wonder? BAIER: Well, it says that the Democratic Party has evolved. Remember where we were, Juan, just in the Obama administration. How, you know, it was -- it was talked about as the camel's nose under the tent. Now it's the whole camel that's under the tent in the Democratic Party. And I think that it'll paint a picture for the general election that is going to be pretty stark if one of these candidates at the top here becomes the nominee. PERINO: How about down there in -- well, where am I? I'm in Iowa, I'm sorry. I'm so confused where I'm in geographically. Greg Gutfeld, do you have a question for these anchors? GUTFELD: Yes, I was just thinking about a camel and the tent. You know, I always wonder like, why it's in Iowa, why it's so serious. I have a theory that it should be moved to New Jersey, should allow everybody to drink, and it could be a raucous caucus in Secaucus. BAIER: That's good. That's good. GUTFELD: I have nothing else. BAIER: You could host. MACCALLUM: Well, that would be very convenient for me. I'd be -- that would be good news for us. PAVLICH: I have a question, actually. PERINO: Go ahead, Katie. PERINO: Brett, so in these results, it says that beating President Trump is the top priority for Iowa Democrats. But when you look at the issues that they talk about, 70 percent want single-payer health care, they want a government option. 89 percent support that. Those are positions that Bernie Sanders has taken that Joe Biden has kind of tried to thread the needle on. BAIER: I think it's fascinating what you're seeing battle -- the battle here in Iowa is the battle in the Democratic Party and how it's going to shape up for the rest of this primary season setting the table. I think the Trump people looking at these numbers in the early polls can feel pretty emboldened that their guy is going to try to hit a little bit more of those moderate tones on some of these issues, especially if the Democratic Party is going left. But again, it's way early. We'll see what comes out. If Joe Biden wins here, that'll be a big, big story in and of itself, after all the we've seen going into it. MACCALLUM: Or if he comes in, you know, third or fourth, that's equally as big a story. He's struggled here in Iowa before. They've worked on, you know, elevating him this time around. But whether or not Iowa is a tricky place for him again this time is also another potential storyline. PERINO: And they are setting expectations pretty low so maybe try to beat those, but maybe they're setting them low for another reason. All right, Bret and Martha, thank you. We'll see you later tonight. ""ONE MORE THING is up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WATTERS: It's time now for one more thing. Rush Limbaugh made a very surprise announcement on his radio program today and he told his listeners that he's just been diagnosed with advanced lung cancer. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO HOST: My intention is to come here every day I can. I've had so much support from family and friends during this that it's been tremendous. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: And our thoughts and prayers go out to El Rushbaugh. He said that he's going to be taking a few days off during the times when he's going to be undergoing treatment, but not every day. He'll be on and off for the next couple weeks so however long it takes to get better, and we wish Rush the best. GUTFELD: Yes, I mean, I don't I can't think of anybody who's been a bigger influence in conservative thought and the person -- the type of person who was able to bridge the intellectual right of Buckley to the common man. I remember when it started in the 80s. There was nothing like it late 80s and there's nothing like him phenomenon. WATTERS: Yes, he really is. Katie? PERINO: Absolute giant. PAVLICH: Yes, I was going to say he's a giant as Dana just said. He was -- he's been a pioneer and he's never backed down from a fight. So I wish him well and I hope that his treatment is successful. WATTERS: Yes, speedy recovery. Juan. PERINO: And he has such an in-depth knowledge of history. I saw him giving a speech -- give a speech one time when he got an award and it was just amazing all of the things that he knew and how much he truly loves America and that transferred to his viewers -- his listeners and viewers. WILLIAMS: Yes. And I just want to say, you know, sometimes Rush and I had big differences, but Rush was always so kind. I think sometimes as humanity escapes, and in a moment like this, Rush, I just want you to know that people across the aisle wish you the best. You're a good man. To quote Will Smith's hit song about Miami, I only came for two days of plan but I always end up wanting to stay, you know, so ""The Five"" was in Miami this weekend for the Super Bowl and we had so much fun. Take a look. Here we are on South Beach. I'm handing off the football to Hall of Famer Terrell Owens. The Fox NFL crew was right next to us. Here I am with their Lego heads, and here I am at the NFL fan experience tossing the football. Here I am with Emily, Jessie, and Dana next to the Lombardi Trophy that as you know, went to the Chiefs last night. And here's the whole crew beachside on Astroturf Football Field with football stars Doug Flutie, Burgess Owens, and Jack Brewer. So much fun in the sun. Congratulations to Kansas City and San Francisco for a fabulous football game. WATTERS: Yes, and I know now for a fact that Juan knows how to party. Dana. PERINO: All right, so this is a great story I heard about when I was in Florida. It takes place in Minnesota in Florida. There's a woman who was reunited with her dog after three years. So her name is Monica Mathis. She's on Facebook and she sees a new campaign launched by Motorworks Brewing in Florida. They teamed up with Manatee County Animal Services to try to spread the word about adoptable dogs. They wanted them to find forever homes. So she's online and she sees her dog Hazel that's been missing for three years. She calls down there to the Manatee County Animal Services. And sure enough, it was her. They're reunited. It's unclear how Hazel made her way from Florida to Iowa. But all because a can of beer and a really great idea by this beer company, they are reunited and back together. PAVLICH: That is awesome. WATTERS: That is great coincidence. All right -- GUTFELD: Well, we haven't done this in a while so let's do it quickly, America. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Animals are great. Animals are great. Animals are great. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: All right. I've always said that climate change is for the birds in a good way. Check out this thoughtful crow who does its own recycling. Look at that, understands exactly what to do, doing his part for the environment. I'm not that crazy about recycling. We all know that it costs more than it's actually worth. But at least it's -- you know, it's the thought that counts. PERINO: They all -- GUTFELD: Crows are the -- crows are the smartest birds on the planet. WATTERS: Yes. I don't -- I don't even recycle, and the crow recycles. PAVLICH: Well, sometimes they do the recycling in the trash anyways. WATTERS: Yes, that's probably why I do it. PAVLICH: All right. So we all know that CPR is a lifesaving thing for humans, but it actually works on lizards too. A firefighter in New South Wales, Australia gave CPR to this lizard using very small tiny compressions on Saturday. The lizard went unconscious after it almost drowned in a swimming pool skimmer. But look at that, he's breathing. The lizard started breathing again and within half an hour, the lizard was on his way hopefully not next to the pool. The Gordon fire station posted the video and it has gone viral. So now you know CPR works if you just barely -- GUTFELD: What was his problem? What was he choking on? PAVLICH: He almost drowned. GUTFELD: Oh, really? WATTERS: Yes. GUTFELD: I should have been listening. I was watching the video. WATTERS: That was a great piece of tape. WATTERS: Wow! I'm going to -- GUTFELD: I am a reptile.

91,FOX,"America knows how the Senate impeachment trial is going to end as Democrats begin strategic retreat, says Jesse Watters on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" January 31, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino, along with Emily Compagno, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It is 5:00 in Miami, and this is THE FIVE.  Yes, the five is here in Miami for the Super Bowl but first let's get into some breaking news because there's a pivotal moment in President Trump's impeachment trial.  House managers and Trump's legal team have wrapped up the debate on witnesses and we are awaiting the statement from Senator Mitch McConnell on how things are going to play out from here. So, let's get the latest from Chad Pergram. Chad?  CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: We are waiting right now for them to come to some sort of agreement to figure out what the lay of the land is going to be like for the rest of the Senate trial. They want to have final arguments from the defense counsel, from the impeachment managers. Maybe speeches from senators and how they bring this end for a landing.  That's what's going on right now. And there's negotiation going off -- going on off the Senate floor that's right now we are in this weird quorum call, they're not actually trying to take attendance in the Senate. What they're trying to do is negotiate some sort of an agreement offstage.  Now one rumor that was burning through the capitol earlier this afternoon is that there was an agreement that they would postpone a final vote on the verdicts, with both articles of impeachment until next Wednesday. Chuck Schumer, the minority leader says that's not true. Listen.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): We have stood for one thing. We do not want this rushed through. We do not want it in the dark of night. Members have an obligation to tell the American people and to the people of their states why they are voting.  So, we are not -- we are going to use whatever power we have to present it -- prevent it from being rushed through, but right now there is no agreement.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERGRAM: And so, we are waiting to see what might come out tonight that will inform us how long they go tonight, how long they go tomorrow and do they may be postpone a vote until after the State of the Union.  One thing I've been told this afternoon, that continuing to conduct the Senate trial here of President Trump while they have State of the Union at the Capitol next Tuesday is a logistical nightmare. And so, they might have to take a pause.  Obviously, there are pressures inside the Democratic caucus to get certain centers running for president to Iowa to campaign. And on the other side of the other disagreement among Republicans on how soon they should wrap this up. You know, senators want to do their due diligence even if it's fait accompli that the president will not be convicted and removed but they want to have their say on the Senate floor.  And there is concern that if they lead this out until Wednesday or Thursday there is always another bombshell that might erupt somewhere on Capitol Hill. When you have the votes to move something you move quickly.  And that would not be the case here if something comes in over the trends between now and next Wednesday or Thursday, and that's why some Republican senators are pressuring Mitch McConnell right now to say let's get this over with and perhaps vote this weekend. Dana?  PERINO: All right, thank you, Chad. We appreciate it. I think everyone would appreciate if it wraps up but it all wrap up when it will wrap up.  In the meantime, I want to play a couple of things. Listen to this from the Democrats who are saying that the president, even if he is acquitted that they don't think that that would be legitimate if they don't have additional witnesses. Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SCHUMER: If my Republican colleagues refused to consider witnesses and documents in this trial, the president's acquittal will be meaningless, because it will be the result of a sham trial.  SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA): You cannot have a true acquittal if you've not had a fair trial.  REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): He will not be acquitted. You cannot be acquitted if you don't have a trial.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Lamar's decision it's an offense against the Senate, it's an offense against the rule of law and it's an offense against the American people.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: One of the president's lawyers Patrick Philbin had something different to say about that. He said the impeachment would be actually considered illegitimate.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  PATRICK PHILBIN, DEPUTY COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT: The House managers have said throughout their presentation and throughout all of the proceedings here again and again that you can't have a trial without witnesses and documents. As if it's just that simple. If you are going to have trial there have to be new witnesses and documents.  But it's not that simple. There is no need for that because these articles of impeachment on their face are defective.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: All right, Jesse, let's take it around the table. Because we're here for the Super Bowl but we still have impeachment going on, and obviously, I mean, they really like Patrick Philbin.  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Yes. Big cheers for Philbin out here in Miami, guys. Yes. He's the starter around here. Now, I cannot believe the Democrats are trying to impeach the president during Super Bowl weekend. It's just un-American and their timing has been terrible. Again, terrible timing.  Just permission to make an analogy, Dana.  PERINO: Are you asking me?  WATTERS: Yes. And it's a sports analogy so just try to follow along.  PERINO: OK.  WATTERS: So, on Sunday night, you know, 49ers are going to play the Chiefs.  PERINO: Got it.  WATTERS: And at the end of the night, the clock is going to run out, one team is going to go back into the locker room and the other team is going to celebrate victory.  Why can't Democrats take a page out of that book and lose gracefully? These people have not accepted defeat when Trump won in 2016. They didn't even accept the Mueller report. And now they are saying the Senate trial where he's going to be acquitted that he is not going to be acquitted and it's not a fair trial.  I mean, this is like flipping a coin, heads, I win, tails, you lose. My 8- year-old daughters have a better grip on reality than that. You can't accuse this guy of cheating every single time he beats you or else you just look like sore losers. And at the end of this whole thing we got to wrap it up, vote on witnesses, vote to acquit and do what Americans do best. In an election year we debate and then we vote.  PERINO: And also, what about the fact that we have all of this like the illegitimate thing.  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Right.  PERINO: So, it's like every -- it's like word games.  GUTFELD: Well, what they've done is, to use the football analogy, they've moved the goalpost into the parking lot.  WATTERS: Yes.  GUTFELD: I mean, I don't know where else they can go with this. And Chad, if I may call him Chad, we've never really met -- it really --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: Have you ever hang out with Chad?  GUTFELD: No, I've never hanged out with Chads.  WATTERS: With Chads.  GUTFELD: But it's all about the next bombshell, which are never bombshell's but they're always waiting for the bombshells which turned out to be egg shells which you crush with your hands. You know what drives me crazy, though? How can the meds -- I said the meds -- the media and the Dems always be so outraged when you knew the ending to this?  We talked about this, we said this is how it was going to end. This is like leaving the theater after seeing the ""Titanic"" and saying, you didn't tell me this ship was going to sink. Now I'm sad. This is all Kabuki theater.  The media and the Dems think you are stupid and that you're going to fall for this even though you knew it ahead of time. Another film analogy, the Dem, this is political stalking. They are stalking the president. This is political stocking.  So, they're like the government version of Glenn Close in ""Fatal Attraction"" and the American people is the bunny.  PERINO: I'm not good.  GUTFELD: Because this is a year three-year long obsession which proves that it's an emotional event which you -- is the reason why you see this hyperbole now amongst Morning Joe and all these other nincompoops who are like pulling out what's left of their hair weaves out.  PERINO: I mean, they don't have your hair.  GUTFELD: They don't have my -- this is real, Morning Joe!  PERINO: This is what happened. Juan, there is an old adage in politics that if you're to lose, lose quickly. But the Democrats are wanting to drag this out.  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: I don't think they necessarily view it in that way. I mean, you know, you guys are talking sports analogies, I think it's a little bit like Tom Brady deflating the football and then winning. Everyone says, what are you going to do? Or the Houston Astros say, you know what, we're cheating.  So, you have the U.S. Senate, the U.S> Senate, they are deliberating. Meanwhile, John Kelly, the former chief of staff says, yes, you know what, John Bolton is probably telling the truth and I think that the president was up to something.  And John Bolton in the New York Times story today --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: He didn't say that.  WILLIAMS: -- again, more information from the book. What is Bolton apparently saying? He was in a meeting not only with the president saying put pressure on the Ukrainians, but also putting now the president's lawyer Pat Cipollone in that meeting. You start to think to yourself, yes, there is more coming. Lev Parnas --  GUTFELD: Bombshells.  WILLIAMS: These are all -- no, it reminds me specifically of what we heard last night from Lamar Alexander when he announced that he would not vote for witnesses. He said, yes, the Democrats have proved their case, but you know what, yes, it's excessive, it's not good behavior but I'm not going to vote for impeachment. You think, what is going on? Have all institutions in the country just gone to hell?  GUTFELD: Your bombshells are Hail Mary's.  WATTERS: Juan, don't you destroy the institutions of this country.  WILLIAMS: Yes.  WATTERS: Don't you dare attack the institution.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: I think Donald Trump is doing a good job.  PERINO: Emily, when the -- so the senators are the jurors, and when a juror wants to go home on a Friday night and the judge wants to wrap it up, what should -- what do you think Mitch McConnell should do? Try to get this done this weekend?  EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, I think it's everyone -- it's in everyone's best interest to have this concluded before the Super Bowl. Look, I think the issue into touch upon what you're talking about is the institution has been already blasted apart by those guys on the Hill.  I have never seen such a perversion of due process or procedure in my life. And you know, I go back to what Pelosi said. She called today for the disbarment --  GUTFELD: Yes.  COMPAGNO: -- of the White House attorneys. And meanwhile, when she was asked about why bribery was not part of the original articles of impeachment she said, no, no, no, I'm not an attorney.  And then we had Adam Schiff just now on the floor not a little while ago that said, the Dershowitz -- the Dershowitz defense of unconstitutionality.  So, we have these people literally attacking the notion that the White House is defending the defendant on trial and they're treating this entire trial, that the jury -- the juror aspect of it as a fact-finding. But that is what is supposed to be what the House did.  GUTFELD: Right.  COMPAGNO: So, they failed, they apparently need more evidence and more bombshells and more ticking clocks, but at the same time nothing has been uncovered like we've seen from the whole time. Which is why the ending was predictable.  WILLIAMS: By the way, what I was saying was that, John Kelly, the former chief of staff was saying 75 percent of the American people, the constituents of the Senate think that we should have witnesses. And yet, the institution somehow says no, that's not what this is about. It's just about showing loyalty to Trump.  WATTERS: Well, you don't --  PERINO: Right.  WATTERS: You can't have a witness if there was no crime, Juan.  WILLIAMS: My gosh.  PERINO: All right. We're going -- we can keep talking about this but we're also going to talk about the Super Bowl. Because there's a lot more to come on this Senate impeachment trial but you've got to stay with The Five. We have special surprises coming up.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WILLIAMS: Welcome back to The Five.  A live look at the Senate floor on this pivotal day of the impeachment trial. We are still awaiting a crucial vote on witnesses. Now if that vote fails it will clear the way for President Trump's acquittal. Here is Adam Schiff earlier.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): Let the American people know that you understand they deserve the truth. Let them know that you still care about the truth, that the truth still matters. Though much divides us, on this we should agree. A trial stripped of all its trappings should be a search for the truth, and that requires witnesses and testimony. A trial without witnesses is no trial at all.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: Emily, how would you respond to that plea coming from the lead prosecutor, lead impeachment manager on the Democratic side?  COMPAGNO: Just how hypocritical I find, given that the entire time after this started the House is clamoring for witness testimony at that point. So much so that they had pending court cases about the testimony. And then all of a sudden it didn't matter. And it had to be rushed -- rushed to finish. And then all of a sudden that didn't matter, and instead they sat on it for four weeks.  And so, it's difficult for me to believe anything out of that man's mouth frankly, but especially when it comes to an actual appreciation of or commitment to actual fact-finding or an actual result that makes sense or transparent process in any way possible because this entire thing has been predictable, political game playing.  WILLIAMS: Jesse, when you hear Adam Schiff say a fair trial and you look at the polls and people say we want witnesses, what do you think?  WATTERS: I say I don't care what Adam Schiff says. I don't care if he wants a fair trial. It wasn't fair in the House. He doesn't get to play it like that, he's not in charge.  The Democrats only want their witnesses. They don't want Republican witnesses and that's just not fair. So, to be lectured on fairness from him is ridiculous. And this is why you can't trust Democrats with power. They will abuse it, they will run over the Constitution, they will put up fabricated pieces of evidence, they will lie about it, deceptive articles, bogus subpoenas, and then they'll claim that they knew what the framers wanted.  I listened to hours and hours and days and days of testimony from probably some of the smartest litigators I've ever heard in my entire life, and they destroyed the Democrats' defense on the facts. They destroyed on the evidence, precedent, the Constitution and the history of this.  These are weak articles, they never should've been set up, this half-baked cake was poisonous. And then are all of a sudden saying the Senate has to swallow it. The Senate doesn't have to do that. The Senate can do whatever it wants. And what the Senate wants to do is get this over with and get onto the 2020 election.  WILLIAMS: Dana, the big news today on the Republican side was first, of course, Lamar Alexander, the senator from Tennessee announcing that he would not vote in support of allowing witnesses to testify. And that was followed up, then later today when Lisa Murkowski said she too would not vote to allow witnesses. What's going on, on the Republican side?  PERINO: Well, it's interesting because it's like the, as I said yesterday the media had all the headlines that the Republicans didn't have enough -- didn't had the votes to block witnesses. It wasn't that the Democrats had to prove their case in order to force witnesses.  And I think that somebody like Senator Alexander and Murkowski, who two days ago the Democrats were saying, wow, these are really principled people. They are just so amazing.  WATTERS: Yes.  PERINO: So, they came to their conclusion and it's like, wow, what happened to them, they're not -- they must not have their principles or had their heads screwed on straight.  WATTERS: Right.  PERINO: I think that both Murkowski and Alexander were thinking about the institution of the Senate and that going forward it is not a good idea to allow a House process that's not complete, that doesn't go to the third coequal branch, the judiciary to try to solve the dispute before sending over something that is half-baked.  WILLIAMS: Really? You know, from my perspective I think obstruction is very real. But let me play something for you, Greg. This is Schiff who is saying that John Bolton should be under oath.  GUTFELD: Yes.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SCHIFF: So here you have the president saying John Bolton is not telling the truth. Let's find out. Let's put John Bolton under oath. Let's find out who is telling the truth. A trial is supposed to be a quest for the truth. Let's not fear what we will learn.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: As I mentioned, the former chief of staff Kelly saying he believes Bolton. What do you say, Greg?  GUTFELD: It doesn't matter. You know, Adam Schiff in that first sound on tape said he was condemning division, which is like a pig condemning pork chops. He is 100 percent made of the stuff.  In the end it requires two-thirds of the Senate vote. Right? To prevent -- why two-thirds? To prevent a partisan impeachment. What this is, is something the Democrats have invented. It's a nuisance impeachment. It's like a nuisance lawsuit except all the Democrats are wearing neck braces and doing slip and falls all at once.  But the sad thing about nuisance impeachments is that they are easy to do depending on who controls the House. So, both sides can do this and it's going to be a ping-pong thing.  Remember how we compare -- we are comparing this impeachment to the one in the '90s.  PERINO: Yes.  GUTFELD: How soon will we be comparing an impeachment in the future to this one? It could be next year. It could be in two years because a nuisance impeachment will be ongoing. It's like construction outside your house. First day you see it, it's like, what's that doing there? And then you just get used to it.  WATTERS: Well, actually, I'm excited about impeaching the next Democrat president. I can't wait.  GUTFELD: What if it's Kanye West?  WATTERS: Well, we'll let it slide in that case.  WILLIAMS: Wow. Honestly, I'll tell you we're live in Miami and maybe we're hot in Miami. Another live look at the Senate floor in Washington as we await that crucial Senate vote on impeachment trial witnesses. You've got to stay with us because The Five is live from Miami.  GUTFELD: Yes.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WATTERS: Welcome back. We continue to monitor the Senate impeachment trial as they approach a critical vote on witnesses. Now the media of course siding with the Democrats and attacking Republicans.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JOE SCARBOROUGH, HOST, MSNBC: Every one of these Republicans are going to be held accountable for them obstructing justice. Obstructing a fair hearing.  JOHN BERMAN, HOST, CNN: And Russia, if you're listening, 2020 is open for investigation.  CARL BERNSTEIN, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, CNN: This is a cover up. Plain and simple. We have seen now a really shameful and an episode in our history that is going to wear down for many, many years.  MICHAEL MOORE, FILMMAKER: He is saying essentially, let's just say this is a court case. Yes? Yes, he beat his wife. So?  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: Greg, this just shows me how ineffective the media is. The media and the Democrats, because they work together.  GUTFELD: Yes.  WATTERS: Not able to convince one Republican in the House and most likely not one Republican in the Senate to side against the president.  GUTFELD: You know, I wrote down five things you probably didn't know about the media but you know now. Number one, it kind of the older echelon, they are getting kind of gross and kind of nonsensical. That leads me to my next step, number two, I think there needs to be term limits for people in the media.  WATTERS: Except us.  GUTFELD: Except us. Sorry. Number three, they could -- if they could spend all this time on this baloney, they must not be doing much else, if they can put all their energy into this.  Number four, they are no longer useful to us, right? There has to be a better way to get your information them from these people like The Five, Fox News, or online. I hear that's a good way to get your news.  And finally, they all know that it's a game. They know this was a game, they knew how it's going to end, right? So, they are just playing you for a fool thinking you won't know that. Those are my five things. I'll be publishing them later.  WATTERS: OK. Juan, if you look at what we've seen in the last three years, the media tried to get Hillary elected, failed. Hillary -- they tried to push the Mueller report, no collusion. And now they try to push impeachment. That is about to fail. What does that say about how strong the media actually is in America?  WILLIAMS: I think that what you are talking about is what you perceive to be liberal media.  WATTERS: I am.  WILLIAMS: You're not talking about conservative media like gee, the Wall Street Journal, Dredge Report --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: I'm talking about 90 percent --  WILLIAMS: Hold on. I'm talking about the number one web site in America, Dredge, I'm talking about the number one newspaper, the Wall Street Journal. I could go on.  But my point to you is when people report something like Alan Dershowitz says, as long as the president thinks it's in the national interest for him to get reelected, then he can do anything.  GUTFELD: He didn't say that.  WILLIAMS: Or -- yes, he did.  WATTERS: No, he didn't.  WILLIAMS: Or Pat Philbin says it's OK for the president to get information from a foreign government to use against a political rival. And you say, media, you're terrible!  WATTERS: Also not true.  WILLIAMS: Why are you reporting that?  WATTERS: All right. So, Juan disagrees with the two most prominent constitutional scholars in the country. That's fine.  WILLIAMS: Yes.  WATTERS: You're allowed to disagree.  WILLIAMS: Wait.  WATTERS: I would just kindly disagree with that.  WILLIAMS: What an analogy. This is Tom Brady and the soft football and you are saying, no problem. Go right ahead.  WATTERS: Yes, you are letting --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: You already used that analogy.  WATTERS: You are letting the air out of this conversation, Juan.  WILLIAMS: Yes. yes.  WATTERS: Emily, what do you think about the media's performance in the impeachment seeing?  COMPAGNO: To me, especially that whole line up, it's one big delusional fabrication. And it reminded me of watching an episode of ""Lost."" Do you remember that show?  GUTFELD: Yes.  COMPAGNO: Or the ""Matrix."" Where you're screaming at the screen like, how can you even be living like this? This is insane. Or they are to each other and you realize that it's just a bubble of delusion.  And we have, if we can show it for a second, we have someone who loves to perpetuate that delusion even further, which is Joe Biden talking about that this isn't partisan impeachment. Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, CHIEF ANCHOR, ABC NEWS: The partisan impeachment was wrong in 1974, wrong in 1998. Why isn't it wrong now?  JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Because it's not a partisan impeachment. He violated the Constitution. Period. Even if it is a party line vote, it just goes -- reflects on those who know in fact in their heart and their head that in fact it's a violation of the Constitution to do what he did, and in fact vote no.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  COMPAGNO: Cocoon delusion.  WATTERS: Right. So, Dana --  GUTFELD: Cocoon.  WATTERS: -- Joe Biden is saying this is not a partisan impeachment. I don't see how he squares that circle.  PERINO: Yes, that was a -- that's a hard one especially when you -- I think it's -- forget Lamar Alexander and Lisa Murkowski and whether they would vote for witnesses, we knew the president was going to be acquitted.  The question is really more -- are there more Democrats that are going to vote with the Republicans on acquittal --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: And we think there are a few of them.  PERINO: If they don't, I'm not going to criticize them.  WATTERS: I will, Dana. All right, coming up next, the 2020 election heats up. President Trump gets the rock star treatment during his Iowa rally as the Democrats get ready for the caucuses.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  COMPAGNO: President Trump firing up the crowd last night in Des Moines, Iowa as 2020 Democrats make a last-minute push ahead of Monday's first in the nation caucuses. Here's the President last night attacking his rivals.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: Let's vote for Pocahontas. Let's vote for Bernie. Let's vote for Sleepy Joe. He's falling to a sleep. Joe -- he always gets the name wrong. How about Buttigieg, Buttigieg? They call him Mayor Pete. You know why? Because nobody can pronounce his name.  What happened to Mini-Mike Where's he? He's not running. He's skipping four or five states. Mini-Mike, I've had him up to here.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Where did he put his hand?  COMPAGNO: All right, we have Mitch McConnell speaking on the Senate floor right now. We're going to take you live to that.

SEN. JACKY ROSEN (D-NV): Aye.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. Rounds --  (END VIDEOTAPE)  COMPAGNO: All right, what you're seeing there is the Senate voting on the impeachment witnesses. Let's go to Chad Pergram right now.  PERGRAM: This is where they take a standard roll call vote in the Senate. This was that seminal vote that we were hearing so much about the past couple of days, a gateway vote whether or not they would open the door to call witnesses or not.  This is a pretty important vote here because, you know, you had Susan Collins from Maine and Mitt Romney from Utah, Republicans announcing last night that they would, you know, vote for witnesses and you had Lamar Alexander, Republican from Tennessee last night saying he would oppose it, and Lisa Murkowski saying this morning that she would oppose it. So we expect this to go down.  What is unclear after this, the Senate is going to take a recess according to the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, what happens next? It was pretty clear that Mitch McConnell had the votes to block this democratic effort to extend the trial and call witnesses. It's pretty clear that they have the votes down the road to exonerate the President of the United States on both articles of impeachment, but what setup Majority Leader Mitch McConnell lacks right now are votes on how you get from A to C. He lacks the votes on B which is how you finish the trial. Do you have additional debate? How much time do you allocate for the defense counsel and the impeachment managers to present their closing arguments? Emily, that is the key question.  And right now there is a problem on the Republican side of the aisle. They don't have the votes for that middle step. And that's why a lot of people think this could go deep into the night. They're trying to negotiate some sort of an agreement off stage. There are senators on the Republican side who want to wrap this tonight saying, wait a minute, we have the votes to exonerate the president. Let's vote now. Why stretch this out through State of the Union. This proposal that was floated earlier in the day, maybe vote on Wednesday, the day after the State of the Union.  But what we know now is that this effort to summon witnesses, that's going to go down. That's what they're voting on right now. And then we will have a recess of an undetermined period in the Senate trial as they try to negotiate what's next offstage. That part is very unclear and very murky at this hour, Emily.  PERINO: All right, actually, Chad, it's going to be Dana, and I'll take it around the horn here, because what we're basically saying is what we knew was going to happen. I guess we didn't know on the witnesses, Jesse. I mean, that was in question, but we know the ultimate and which is acquittal. So now at this point, if the Democrats know that the Republicans will prevail on no additional witnesses, why not just try to get it done this weekend? I don't understand their political benefit of dragging it out. WATTERS: Well, when you drag it out, there's an opportunity for more bombshells.  GUTFELD: Yes.  WATTERS: And also, I guess, gives the media an opportunity to continue to shame Senate Republicans who they think are somewhat on the fence. And they want to make sure that Donald Trump delivers his State of the Union address as not acquitted.  And I just don't see why the Republicans in the Senate, they don't have the votes right now to say let's just wrap it and go. Why don't they just say let's do that get it over with? Why do they have to say oh, well, I want two hours to say something, and then I want another couple of hours to say something?  We've already heard from all of these managers. We've heard from the President's defense councils. We don't need to hear from 100 senators to say what they want to say.  PERINO: All right, let's --  WATTERS: They just put out a statement instead.  PERINO: Chad Pergram, are you still there with us?  PERGRAM: Yes, I'm here, Dana. So they've just closed --  PERINO: OK, what was the final -- what was the final there?  PERGRAM: Pretty much what we thought, the fait accompli 51-49. The Senate voted to reject the motion on calling witnesses. And because they don't know the roadmap next, this is why the Senate is now in a recess of an undetermined period. They're going to go off stage and try to figure out what's next.  But 51-49, that was the breakdown. And that's kind of what we thought earlier today once we got the announcement from Lisa Murkowski that she would oppose calling witnesses and the announcements last night from Lamar Alexander, Mitt Romney, Susan Collins, and so on. Everything was set in stone.  But again, the problem is Mitch McConnell doesn't know how to get to a final vote. That's what the -- in the Senate trial, and that's what these offstage negotiations are going to be about deep into the night tonight, Dana.  PERINO: All right, Chad, we have one question from Juan and then we're going to get some commentary from Greg and Emily. Go ahead, Juan.  WILLIAMS: So you get two votes from Republicans, Chad, for allowing the witnesses. And now you're telling us that in fact, it's the Republican side led by Mitch McConnell that doesn't have the votes to shut this down. And I think just sitting here, that it must be that Republican -- some Republican senators want the opportunity to speak as to why they are voting the way they are voting when it is seen as so damaging to the institution.  PERGRAM: Absolutely. You could see where someone like Susan Collins, the Republican from Maine. She is facing a competitive reelection fight this fall in a battleground state. She might want to come out and talk about her position.  You know, there's a lot of senators even though those who want to extinguish this trial as quickly as possible, who say we are senators, this is an impeachment trial. We have not been given the opportunity to deliberate and speak on the Senate floor. It is our right. I mean, that's the fundamental right of the Senate is unlimited debate.  And if you're going to neuter, that you fundamentally change the essence of the Senate. And if you've had none of that in a Senate trial, some people might think that that undercuts the quintessence of the Senate, Juan.  PERINO: All right, we have -- we have Chuck Schumer now live, Chad. Thank you so much. Let's go to Chuck Schumer.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): -- where the Senate turned away from truth and went along with a sham trial. This -- if the President is acquitted, with no witnesses, no documents, the acquittal will have no value, because Americans will know that this trial was not a real trial. It had no witnesses, no documents, it's a tragedy on a very large scale.  I will be now going up to my caucus to discuss what we're doing next. I will not talk about it here, OK. Thanks.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: All right, Chad Pergram, if you're still there, basically, Chuck Schumer knew that this is the likely outcome. What now is he going to go up and talk to his caucus about?  PERGRAM: Well, he's kind of reveling in the fact that Mitch McConnell has this problem. The problem is not with Democrats, the problem is with Republicans. You know, they have the majority. If you have the majority, move. And so that's the issue right now. And so he's going to talk to his caucus about if they come back into session, what things does he put on the table, what proposals.  You might remember that very lengthy session Tuesday night, last week, going into the wee hours of Wednesday, where they considered multiple proposals from Schumer about how to consider this trial, what witnesses to call, talking about calling John Bolton, talking about calling Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House Chief of Staff, you could have a similar, you know, reprise of that in the next few hours if the Senate were to be in session.  And this is why McConnell has recessed the Senate so they don't get into that right away. And then you have a lot Senators, some of those vulnerable centers having to take those challenging votes or dragging the Senate down into this quagmire over the next few hours as they fight over this. What they try to do is he's going to go back and say, OK, what are the issues here, what should we be considering?  You know, there was a proposal from Dick Durbin, the Democratic whip along with Sherrod Brown from Ohio and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, to allow all senators to have a 10-minute wedge of time to talk, you know, put their positions on the record about the trial, again, because senators have not spoken on the Senate floor during this lengthy trial.  And so, you know, Senators think, you know, they represent X number of people in each state. They should at least be able to express their views on the Senate floor in a debate in only the third presidential impeachment trial in Senate history. Some people regardless of whether you think you should impeach the president knighted states or not say, if you don't do that, then what good is the Senate at all if you can't even debate that on the Senate floor?  PERINO: Chad, that makes a lot of sense. I can -- I can understand why the senators want to have their say. Thank you so much. Let's go to John Roberts with the latest for us, wherever you are, John.  JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: North Lawn of the White House where I'm always staying, Dana.  PERINO: OK. I couldn't see where you were.  ROBERTS: I love to be down there with you in Miami where the President is winging its way toward at least most of the way there. He'll be landing in West Palm Beach pretty soon. I'm sure that they were watching the vote on Air Force One a short time ago. Clearly, it was no surprise. They knew that Mick Mulvaney had the votes to turn down witnesses.  And it's interesting because the President has said all along, hey, look, I'd like to have witnesses. I'd like to hear from John Bolton. I'd like Mick Mulvaney to testify. I'd like to have Mike Pompeo go up there and tell his story, but I also want to hear from people like Hunter Biden, and the whistleblower, and maybe even Joe Biden.  I mean, it was clear that if they were going to be witnesses, that the republicans and the president, in particular, we're going to push for it. Democrats can't just have their witnesses, the White House and the President are going to want to have his witnesses as well. So I mean, this does alleviate a long protracted battle, because I'm sure that there's no way that Pat Cipollone was going to let John Bolton get up there in front of Congress and testify without going through all of the courts.  And that could be a lengthy process. That could take place over the course of weeks, if not months. So this is going to alleviate a long drawn out battle. It could go well into the Democratic primary contest. But I think what we're seeing here in the Senate is a no surprise to the White House. I think they're probably pretty happy with the outcome.  But as Chad Pergram was saying, now, how do you get to the end. The White House is confident that there are not 67 votes to take the president out. There might be a couple of Republican defections, but that only is going to get you to maybe 50, 51 votes maximum. So certainly not the 67. So President Trump is confident that he's not going to be removed from office.  And you -- and you watch because he tweeted about it again today saying that he believed that the process in the house was completely unfair. The Democrats had all the witnesses they want and a lot of it was being closed doors. Some of the transcripts of those closed-door sessions were not released. His team was not allowed any witnesses in the House proceeding. They didn't even have a chance to present its case until it got to the Senate.  And that's something that he will definitely focus in on between now and November, and to say that, you know, Republicans are not getting a fair shake out of this process, and then nothing like this should ever happen to another American president. The President will say, Dana, that he's doing this for future presidents, not just himself.  PERINO: He has said that, John. Thank you. We have news from Chad Pergram about something out of Mitch McConnell's office. Chad?  PERGRAM: Yes. So Mitch McConnell just put out a statement about that vote that went down rejecting witnesses. He said, look, we've been through all of these documents, we've heard all these arguments. We don't think that we need to have witnesses. But I'm going to refer to the final paragraph of this statement here from Mitch McConnell here, and I'm just reading this off my phone because things are happening in real-time here on Capitol Hill.  ""Senators will now confer among ourselves with the House managers and with the President's Council to determine the next steps as we prepare to conclude the trial in the coming days, in the coming days."" This is the first time definitively we've heard something from someone in leadership. You know, the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell indicating that this is not going to wrap up eminently.  I was told earlier in the day that they thought that there was no chance that they would finish this tonight. So the coming days is the key question. Now, again, you know, a couple of hours ago on another program, I was asked whether or not they would consider postponing State of the Union. There's a bit of a logistical issue here for Tuesday. I spoke to one congressional security source who told me that there had been no consideration of that whatsoever, but would not rule it out.  You know, here's the other thing, that so much of what we see in politics is very scripted. It's very, you know, kind of wrote and we expect A then B, then C. What we're seeing here at the Capitol tonight is unfolding in real-time. We really don't know how this is going to turn out. We know that probably in a day or two, that they will exonerate the President of the United States on the articles of impeachment. But what happens in the interim? What happens tonight? What happens over the weekend? Who gets to speak?  You know, that interim, you know, kind of process is very up in the air and Mitch McConnell nor Chuck Schumer nor any of us can interpret exactly what's going to happen because nobody really knows. Why? It will come down to the votes. They have to figure out some sort of agreement, 51 votes that can pass the Senate to set the remaining framework for this trial and get to final verdict for the President, as Mitch McConnell says, ""in the coming days.""  PERINO: All right, all right, close quote. Thank you, Chad Pergram. And we're going to take it around the table here on the remaining time that we have. You have some thoughts there, Greg?  GUTFELD: Thank God he kept that short. Wow. Look, I said the same thing over and over again, because we knew what was going to happen. The story never changes. It's like when you're dealing with a drug addict, who says no, no, I change I swear, I change. No, this story has been the same. We knew how the vote was going to go. We know how it's going to go next week or the week after that because we know the kernel. The nugget of this story is that it was initiated three years ago, right?  This quixotic adventure is not about a phone call. It was about the day Hillary lost. So we all know that. What we're being forced to participate in is the Democrats version of revenge porn. And that's why it is so exhausting to be sitting here and listening every day to this and then have to feel bad for the viewers who had to sit through this crap.  PERINO: Well --  WATTERS: It's funny that you mentioned that because Adam Schiff actually tried to get naked pictures of Donald Trump.  GUTFELD: Yes.  WATTERS: So well said, Greg. I'm not going to spike the football, Juan, because I don't want to do that. I'm not a Showboat. Democrats just suffered an enormous tactical loss right then on the floor of the Senate. We know how it ends from now. This is a strategic retreat by the Democrats. They're still trying to empty their clips, but it's pretty much done.  McConnell has guided this thing through the system very well, very methodically, very maturely, a little bit of a speed bump here, but I'm sure he's kind of -- kind of bring the boat to home. Now, this now looks more than ever, like this whole impeachment thing was a move to protect Joe Biden. Trump had zeroed in on his family's corruption. They tried to knock him out at the knees. It went all the way up to the Senate trial, and then we get an acquittal.  And you have to look at yourself and think this thing backfired, because now everybody's talking about where is Hunter. Everybody understands Joe quid pro Joe is his new nickname, not sleepy anymore. His crowd size is microscopic at this point, and Bernie Sanders is surging in Iowa. So it did not go as planned.  And my only thing now is what do the Democrats do next? You know, they boycotted the inauguration, they teed up a special counsel investigation, they tried to impeach the president, he gets acquitted. What are they going to do in the second term? I mean, they handled the first loss so terribly. What happens with a landslide? I'm scared, Juan, hold me.  WILLIAMS: I'll hold you. I'll hold you.  WATTERS: I know it's going to be dangerous.  WILLIAMS: I know. I know. My darling, you are so, so evil. I know because I can see that on the Republican side right now, Mitch McConnell scorched earth strategy to protect the president that clearly it's no longer the GOP, it's the party of Trump, and they are protecting Trump at all --no holds barred.  Let's just protect Donald Trump. They couldn't get to Republicans right now to say shut down a fair trial, no witnesses, so that's why the two broke away. They could -- but remember, the American people and Democrats couldn't get four to simply say, let's have a fair trial, let's have some witness.  WATTERS: They're going to get three Senate Democrats to vote to acquit.  WILLIAMS: Hang on. Hang on. So what you get right now is Republicans, Republican senators, starting to ask questions about how they come out of this even in the party of Trump. What will they look like with a ticket led by Donald Trump where they have to defend the fact that they allowed the Senate, the institution to suffer such damage, that they allowed the American people to be diluted that John Bolton is off the charts. Everybody around, Donald Trump goes down. And they say, oh, we got to protect Donald Trump.  PERINO: It's really interesting because you have these -- Emily, people have such strong feelings on both sides. And if you look at the polling from the beginning of this to now, nothing has changed except the president's approval ratings ticked up a point or two.  COMPAGNO: Right, because while this is all going on, he's actually earning the paycheck that he donates whereas everyone else on the Hill, they are not earning the paychecks that we pay and that our tax dollars pay. I think we're so far beyond strategy at this point. We're so far beyond tactics. It's just ego.  The ego of -- the ego of Schumer, especially in those comments right there, where he's basically saying that he has zero faith in his fellow senators. It was their prerogative and their assessment during that vote to determine whether they needed additional evidence to vote and to move on those articles of impeachment.  The votes said enough. So why all of a sudden when it suits them versus the political process, and then all of a sudden, oh, no, it's a trial that we see mirrored in actual courts, and therefore witnesses are a must. But there was zero discussion of evidence. I think the GOP has extended a generous amount of patience, but it's not infinite.  And so to your point about just around the corner, and just around the corner, and what about this, at one point, is it going to end? The statement we just saw right there in the vote, it ends now.  PERINO: Well, the State of the Union, I don't think they're going to -- they'll figure out a way. They shouldn't delay the State of the Union. Everybody wants the president to be -- oh, I shouldn't say everybody.  GUTFELD: I'm making my State of the Union (INAUDIBLE).  PERINO: Oh, wow.  GUTFELD: Yes. If I -- if I can't have my (INAUDIBLE) on the State of the Union, I don't know what I'm going to do. You know what the story is about, Dana. I'm going to do like a -- like a lifetime thing. It's about the power of the House, the power of the President, but most important, the power of the media to shape a narrative to suit their needs. That's what this is about.  WILLIAMS: You know what this is like? I remember after Mueller, the President said he had been totally exonerated. Of course, Mueller said no such thing to the point.  GUTFELD: How did that Mueller think work out for you, Juan?  WILIAMS: But you know what -- no, what I'm saying is the president comes out and he just talked about setting the way America --  GUTFELD: But Mueller was a disaster for your side.  WILLIAMS: It's the guy with the bully pulpit and you can be sure that's what Trump is going to say even though that's not the case.  GUTFELD: No, but Mueller was a disaster for your side.  WILLIAMS: No.  GUTFELD: He was not -- he was not in good shape.  WILLIAMS: Oh, I see. Because he didn't indict the president.  GUTFELD: No, it was a mess, Juan. It was a mess. He was embarrassing.  WATTERS: He spent two years investigating a hoax and then couldn't defend his own work during a hearing.  WILLIAMS: Oh, my gosh.  WATTERS: Now you keep saying that Trump is destroying all these institutions. I would argue that the left is destroying themselves. If you look at the FBI. The FBI agents Peter Strzok, James Comey, they destroyed that institution.  WILLIAMS: Oh, yes.  WATTERS: The media, they have destroyed themselves because no one believes the thing they say anymore because they lie. The Supreme Court after Kavanaugh, you say that now institution has been compromised. No, that was another lie by people like Dianne Feinstein and Michael Avenatti. And finally, now that the Senate has constitutionally on the verge of quitting the president, you're saying now the Senate as an institution been destroyed.  WILLIAMS: Well, let me just say -- all right, let me just say this.  WATTERS: All of that is not true.  WILLIAMS: Let me just say this.  WATTERS: And I think you owe all of those institutions an apology.  WILLIAMS: No, because they're being damaged and I hate to see it because I love America. And I'm going to tell you something. The division is evident in the fact that as we sit here today, Dana was talking about the numbers haven't moved. The numbers haven't moved from this. About half -- it is. Half the American people think this guy should be out of office. How is that healing?  PERINO: Well, they'll have the opportunity to vote.  GUTFELD: You know what will heal people? You know what will heal people? Do you know that tomorrow night, Jesse has a live show at 8:00? Emily is on the ""GREG GUTFELD SHOW"" tomorrow night.  WILLIAMS: I'm going to watch. I'm going to watch. I'm here. I'm putting down the liquor.  GUTFELD: I have to put in a plug. That's right. That's right.  PERINO: That's a very good plug.  GUTFELD: Also, we're on -- we're on a 5:00.  WILLIAMS: Sunday.  PERINO: Sunday.  WILLIAMS: Sunday.  GUTFELD: 5:00, baby.  PERINO: And also, Juan and I will be here from 12:00 to 2:00 Sunday. There's so many plugs it's like Greg's hair.  Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2020 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

92,FOX,"How can a president accomplish many effective things and still face a hateful opposition? As President Trump signs yet another trade deal and reveals a Middle East peace plan amid an economic boom, it raises a key question. How can a president do so many effective things, yet still face such hateful opposition?

Yet, like a T-shirt cannon, the media can shoot those messages to you at home and call it an honest day’s work. It’s safe to say much of the disconnect between Trump's results and the ""polls"" is largely media-driven.

94,FOX,"President Trump's defense team hits back hard against Democrats while wrapping up opening statements in the Senate impeachment trial; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" January 28, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST: Hello, everybody. I am Jesse Watters, along with Kennedy, Juan Williams, Dana Perino, and Greg Gutfeld. It is 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is ""The Five."" GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Nobody's high. WATTERS: President Trump's legal team hitting back hard against Democrats while wrapping up opening statements in the impeachment trial. It comes as liberals and the media continue to salivate over new leaks from a book written by John Bolton. The latest leak claims Bolton told Attorney General Bill Barr the he was concerned that Donald Trump was doing favors for autocrats. But not so fast, the Department of Justice is disputing Bolton's account and saying it was grossly mischaracterized. Here is the president's legal team responding. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You cannot impeach a president on an un-sourced allegation, responding to an unpublished manuscript that may be some reporters have an idea of maybe what it says. I mean, that's what the evidence -- if you want to call that evidence, I don't know what you call that. I call it inadmissible, but that's what it is. There is no violation of law. There is no violation of the Constitution. There is a disagreement on policy decisions. The next president, or the one after that, he or she will be held to that same standard? (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: And the president's lawyers ended their defense by using Democrats' own words against them on impeachment. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are permitting a constitutional coup d'etat which will haunt this body and our country forever. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I warn my colleagues that you will reap the bitter harvest of the unfair partisan seeds you sow today. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My fear is that when a Republican wins the White House, Democrats will demand payback. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You were right, but I'm sorry to say you were also prophetic. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: OK. So smart tactics obviously to play that, and they said, even by the Democrats' own standards, you would have to impeach every single president going back to George Washington. Dana, how do you think they closed tonight? DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: So it was Cipollone with the last statement we just heard when he said you were prophetic. I was paying attention. I was sitting there for three hours. I thought he said pathetic. (CROSSTALK) PERINO: I was like, wow, that was tough, but prophetic. I get it. The thing is the Democrats could go and they could find the same type of Hippocratic statements from 20 years ago on the other side, and it could go back and forth. Because we know that's exactly what happened with all of this, which was kind of the point. And I know Greg talked about this that Alan Dershowitz was making last night, and that Sekulow made as well today, which is, if you have this low bar for impeachment. Everyone who's going to get impeached and it doesn't really matter because it's not bipartisan if you keep bringing partisan -- and also, no actual crimes in impeachment. And you just say, oh, abuse of power instead of obstruction of justice. But we didn't go to the court system to try to figure that out. It becomes a campaign commercial. And I think both sides actually ended up with a lot that they could go into 2020 with. You'd be seeing a lot of this I think in a lot of those ads. WATTERS: Yeah. Dershowitz, late into the evening last night, and I think everyone believes he made a very strong case that the articles themselves are not what the framers intended. And here is what he saying about John Bolton's manuscript that we haven't even seen. Role that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If a president, any president, were to have done what The Times reported about the content of the Bolton manuscript. That would not constitute an impeachable offense. Let me repeat, nothing in the Bolton revelations, even if true, would rise to the level of an abuse of power or an impeachable offense. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Strong argument. GUTFELD: He is such a hypocrite. I just couldn't let Dana pass on that one. PERINO: Sorry. I've been talking a lot. GUTFELD: I thought Dershowitz was amazing. I had to watch it on another network, but that's OK. But what he did, which I thought was really interesting, it was the perfect way to put it that you can't make the criteria for impeachment the criteria for voting. And that's what is happening. So you create these vague, unspecific feelings about this person that you don't like. Well, that's how you deal -- you deal with it at the election. You don't pull out, you know, the Howitzer that's impeachment. He says that we're actually -- the arguments are actually a criteria for voting, not a criteria for impeachment. If you do that, what you are doing is you are breaking the seal. Impeachment will become as regular as me on FiberCon. He also said a lot of other great things. (CROSSTALK) LISA KENNEDY MONTGOMERY, GUEST CO-HOST: You know I wish that was a social media app. GUTFELD: Yes, it should be. But you know what? The big message here, I thought, and I thought he made it so clear. He was so friendly when he was doing this, which was the opposite of the Democrats. You cannot let your emotional dislike based on a collection of flaws dictate a process, because in the future everybody's going to do it. Everybody's going to do it. And partisan impeachment must fail. It has to fail, because it requires two-thirds of the vote of the Senate. And that kind of tells you it can't be partisan. Lastly, I know everybody's going to say, oh, but witnesses, but witnesses. Don't listen to them. You don't need witnesses. And when people say, well, then the Democrats are going to say that it wasn't a fair trial. Because they didn't call witnesses -- you can say, I don't care, because if you don't have that argument, you're just going to find another one, and you're going to find another bombshell that's really an eggshell. You're going to find something else to replace that argument. Fight your fight. Don't worry about their response because their response is always going to be the same. They hate you. WATTERS: All right. Well, to that point about witnesses, Juan, would you trade Hunter for Bolton? JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: No, it's very interesting. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: No. WILLIAMS: Well, I was just going to say -- (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: -- Sherrod Brown, the Senator from Ohio, said he would do it. WATTERS: He would. WILLIAMS: That's what he said right here on Fox. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: -- no. First of all, he doesn't speak for everybody. He's not Chuck Schumer. He's not making the call from the caucus, but he's speaking as an individual. And he heard others, Senator Whitehouse also on Fox saying it is not a one for one. It's like the Democrats get to call the witnesses they want and let the Republicans have the responsibility of calling witnesses who have nothing to do with this impeachment. WATTERS: So would Schumer just work out the witness deal with McConnell? WILLIAMS: I think what Whitehouse was saying is that the rules call for each party to have their witnesses if you decide to have witnesses. But I just want to respond to some of what I was hearing here, because, you know, it seems to me that Bolton, he has been under assault from the right for the last 24 to 48 hours since the story broke. He is now like a bad guy. All of a sudden you think John Bolton. I know John Bolton. John Bolton is a Neocon. John Bolton is a hard right guy. that's why he was in the Trump White House. And now, people are saying oh, no. He is a backstabbing, bad man. To me, what strikes me is -- again, this is not what we heard today from Jay Sekulow. Jay Sekulow said this is just a policy disagreement. This is not. What you hear from Bolton is this was about the president, in fact, saying I'm going to withhold aid to get something for myself. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: I'm sorry. I said Sekulow, right? And so Bolton in -- what Bolton has written, he's saying the president withheld something that was beneficial to him in terms of his political future and nothing to do with American interests for foreign policy. GUTFELD: It does. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: Alan Dershowitz made the point. It is not an impeachable offense even if that happened. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: But he was saying it was just a policy disagreement. MONTGOMERY: That's the point that Sekulow was making, like, let's take this on its face and let's assume that all of it is true, and all of it is bad. Still, even with -- that's our conversation, what might've happened, that doesn't rise to the level of impeachment, and here it shouldn't. So President Trump ran on the idea that our foreign policy is pretty screwed up. And we've had it wrong in the Middle East for quite some time. The enemy of my enemy is my friend. And that has been our mantra in the Middle East and around the world, and it's very flawed. But that's what the Democrats are going on right now, and they continue to do that. So if you look at the president's enemies, they consider them friends. And those have been some bad friendships that have ended very poorly, Michael Cohen, Michael Avenatti, Lev Parnas, and now John Bolton. John Bolton has -- yes, he has been despised by the left for a long time because of his foreign policy and his world view, which is, you know, tends to be a little hawkish. But now, all of a sudden, Democrats, not only they've woken up and they've discovered federalist 65 and Alexander Hamilton and all of the founders and the Constitution. But now, to them, John Bolton is a patriot because he is the enemy of the president. And I think in the end that is going to rest where our -- (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: But you're pointing out the Democrats. And I'm saying the Republicans are the ones going after Bolton. And it reminds me yesterday they were going after Rudy Giuliani. Rudy Giuliani is -- (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: He's nobody. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: Ignore Rudy Giuliani. PERINO: I think that you can have a third party in America, the hypocrite party. WATTERS: The hypocrite party, OK. Up next, while Democrats obsess over impeachment, President Trump getting ready to hold a huge rally tonight. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PERINO: While Washington is being consumed by impeachment, President Trump looking ahead to 2020, holding a big rally tonight in New Jersey. Crowds are lining up early this morning, and some supporters actually camped out overnight in anticipation. And the president is also pressing ahead with his agenda. Today, he unveiled a Middle East peace plan. And tomorrow, the president will be holding a USMCA trade deal signing event, so it is full steam ahead. And there is a question down there in Jersey that he won -- this district in Jersey won by plus 20. But this is a big draw because local Philly suburbs are going to be able to see this because of the local media market. I'm looking at you, Philly Kid. And Jeff Drew, who was the Congressman that switched parties from Democrat to Republican, so after impeachment, he'll -- this is his district, so it's a big boost for him and a frustration to his Republican challengers. Let me go to you, Jesse, about this. And we could also -- if you would like to you could call to my chart. WATTERS: Yeah. We will definitely get to the chart. GUTFELD: Making charts for you to call for. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: Dana and I have the same chart. Juan's head is going to explode. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: We'll get to it in a second. But to the point, though, do you want to do it now? Let's do it now, all right? This is amazing from Gallup. This is how Americans' satisfaction levels have changed since the Barack Obama presidency ended. Look at the improvement, 22-point improvement on satisfaction on the economy, terrorism, up 18. Race relations improved upon the first black president by 14 percent, their feelings about crime, income inequality, plus eight percent. So these are the kind of measurables that you can really look at. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: -- the American people feel better under Donald Trump on the biggest issues that they care about, and here is why. Trump is great at the split screen presidency -- you'll have a CNN debate and he'll do a rally. You'll have Nancy handing out pens. He'll sign the China phase one. And by the way, I talked to a big investor guy who does a lot of deals in Asia. He said China took it in the-you-no-what, so bad the USA gave up literally nothing. So that was a huge trade deal. And if you look at -- wage is up, stock market up, crime down, terrorism on the retreat, plus, you have the gas prices very low, and the home needing (ph) cost very low. This is a very rich and prosperous, comfortable, happy country. And the president has always been about results that you can see. Even if you look at the real estate that he put up, you see the big building, the golf course, you see it. You saw him on television. He has always defined himself by results that are tangible. Same thing with the presidency, and if this guy had been pulling stunts and had this kind of chaos and trash talk and hadn't gotten any results, he would've been one and done. But because he is accomplishing things that people can feel, I bet he will get a second chance. WILLIAMS: Can I respond? WATTERS: Please. WILLIAMS: Isn't it curious that given all you said, which is, oh, the economy is good, crime is not bad, all that, guess what? In the Fox poll, half of the country not only supports impeachment but removal. If you look at the average of polls, it's split in terms of that. And today, 75 percent said we want witnesses at this trial. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: I see, all right. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: Those are polls, and he just cited real numbers. WILLIAMS: Those were polls, too. What are you talking about? GUTFELD: I know. In fact -- you heard what he said after. He went through and listed the facts that are responsible for the polling. You're listing polling that are based on media reporting. WILLIAMS: No, no. What I'm saying to you is -- (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: Because that's the thing -- (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: -- by the media narrative. Those polls are media narrative. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: No, what I'm talking about are facts in terms of people see this president. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: -- dividing the American people. GUTFELD: OK. This is -- goes back to -- I've said this a million times. Why is it that what he achieves is so far removed from the emotional strife, right? Wouldn't that tell you something? That perhaps the emotional strife is disconnected from who he is or how you think he is? And that maybe it is time after three years, Juan, to let go of the emotional pain and just admit that there is -- what we see is a happy, prosperous, peaceful country? Your polls activate a mental issue, not a physical one. WILLIAMS: All right. So you're saying that -- if I say to you, let's start a war. Let's do something provocative and I then say, it's not a war. Then I should get lots of credit. Or if I say, let's start a trade war and let's put out farmers -- (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: Sixty eight percent of the country are pleased with the economic and national security -- (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: -- that it wasn't just -- (CROSSTALK) MONTGOMERY: I just want to clarify something, because I think oftentimes when people -- and with polling, you have to read what the exact questions are that pollsters are asking. Because there is a way of manipulating data based on the wording that you use. And you can oftentimes elicit the response you want from people based on how you ask the question. Another thing is when people pick up the phone, they're more willing. If they're actually willing to talk to a pollster, tell the pollster what they think the pollster wants to hear. And they signal that by the question. So someone could say, yeah, I think we should remove him. But then in the next spread (ph) say, things are going so great at the business. Herb and I are going to hire two more people. And you know what? We are going to buy a boat because this is great. So you vote for the president of the -- oh yeah. And honestly, I do believe that the emotional disconnect that Greg is talking about is very real for a lot of people. They love the results of some of these policies. They don't like a lot of the behavior. GUTFELD: They don't like the guy. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: That was my point. GUTFELD: I agree. They don't like the guy. But you don't have to like the guy to say he's doing a great job. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: Problem solved. WILLIAMS: OK, but -- (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: You don't have to like him, Juan. Write a book about how much you hate him. WILLIAMS: All right. But like today, today with the Middle East plan, he stands up there with Netanyahu that second time. He's trying to pump Netanyahu's re-election. And he says I have a Middle East peace plan. You think, oh, really where are the Palestinians? Are they buying into this? (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: What can he do? You're already trashing it. WILLIAMS: But he didn't set it up. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: So he is telling people I won my. I got a deal, nonsense. PERINO: All right. I'm really glad I brought the chart. President Trump hitting back after CNN mocks his supporters. We'll show you that next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MONTGOMERY: All right. CNN once again taking heat for mocking Trump supporters, take a look at this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He also knows deep in his heart that Donald Trump couldn't find Ukraine on a map if you had the letter U and a picture of an actual physical crane next to it. He knows that this is, you know, an administration defined by ignorance of the world. And so that's partly him playing to their base and playing to their audience. You know the credulous boomer rube demo that backs Donald Trump. That wants to think Donald Trump is the smart one. And you all are elitists are dumb. You're elitists with your geography and your maps and your spelling, your math and your reading. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That was good, sorry. That was a good one. I needed that. (END VIDEO CLIP) MONTGOMERY: Oh, look at you with you cosmopolitan your bias. The liberal network getting intense backlash and the president is fighting back, saying, quote, ""Don Lemon, the dumbest man on television with terrible ratings"" end quote, Ivanka Trump calling the clip disgusting. So Greg, does this -- is this one of those moments where the media left show their bias against a large chunk of the country? GUTFELD: Well, first, I want to tell you I did come up with a drink called the Lemon Ricky. It is half pompous, half ass. I don't really -- I'm all for ridicule. You ridicule the guy, though, and what -- the problem with CNN is they ridicule everybody. And this has always been kind of their thing. They really do look down their noses at most -- at least half of America. It's no wonder their ratings are in the tank. If that is a pure campaign ad, somebody's got to make it. But I will say this. Rick Wilson, there is definitely something wrong with him. I don't what it is but there's something wrong with him. The joke wasn't that bad. It was Lemon's just overdoing it, hyper-dramatic, oh, my god, this is the best thing ever like he was having an orgasm. MONTGOMERY: Like Jimmy Fallon on SNL. GUTFELD: Yes, no -- not, don't ever soil Fallon by comparing him to Don Lemon. But it killed me -- the over reaction was just so silly and sad. And CNN's in trouble. And they need help. No wonder they're watching us all the time. Their media crew watching Fox to figure out what we're doing right -- (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: Yes. MONTGOMERY: Well, maybe it's respecting people's votes and people's points of view, even when they don't square with your own. And I think that's one of the biggest problems. What do you see here? PERINO: Well, many people are the first to try to point out, and -- Rick Wilson and others, when the president says something impolite or harsh about another person, they will immediately -- and I don't like it either from the beginning. Although, my nickname I really liked was the little rocket man. That was my favorite one. Ones that are personal in nature, I don't like. And then I also knew that as soon as Hillary Clinton said deplorables, like, that was it. Like, here we go. And I also I don't understand -- I guess using a southern accent to mimic somebody who apparently is dumb and doesn't read is really offensive. I mean, people come from different regions of the country. You have accents from people from all over the world. It has nothing to do with your intelligence. It has to do with where you were raised. And so that, I think, is offensive. GUTFELD: Yeah. How many surgeons have southern accents? I'm pretty sure a million. WATTERS: That's why I don't make sweeping generalizations about large groups of people, Greg. GUTFELD: Thank you, sexy. PERINO: Really, starting now? (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: That's right. I'm not that offended by it. And I'm not offended on behalf of someone by that. But, you know, I'm usually the one that offends other people, so stay out of my lane. No, but so I have a unique understanding of the situation. The two guys on the right and the left, they're like hired guns. They are not going to pay a price. GUTFELD: That's true. WATTERS: All right. There's no parent company there. Don Lemon is the guy in trouble because he is supposed to be the straight news guy. And CNN is already in trouble with bad ratings. And he's got problems on the side. So I'm sure -- (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: Guy, you are a prime time person, and you're losing it because someone is making fun of millions of Americans for being dumb southerners. (CROSSTALK) PERINO: Don, that was brilliant. Your comedic instincts were spot on. This is what we're supposed to be doing. WATTERS: That's what's happened over there at CNN, and they deserve the ridicule. Because like you said, they're going to turn around and add like this or just give a talking point to every Republican to Donald Trump to hammer the left, to hammer the media in an election year where Democrats have to regain their footing with white working-class Americans, you know, non-college educated people in Iowa, Florida, and the rustbelt, so not great timing. MONTGOMERY: There are -- there are plenty of people in the south who have advanced degrees, who look at someone like Bernie Sanders and say he does not represent my interests. I like my money. I want to take care of my children. I will not vote for him. Therefore, I will vote for Donald Trump. Not everyone with the southern accent is a deplorable rube, Juan. WILLIAMS: I would agree. There's no argument there. I was surprised though to hear that Greg and Jesse both said they didn't take any great offense at this. That they think that if you want to have this kind of ridicule word you use -- GUTFELD: I think -- no, I said that ridicule is great when it's directed at a person but not at a group of people. WILLIAMS: OK. GUTFELD: They directed it at a people. WILLIAMS: Because I think that nobody -- it's no secret CNN is more Liberal, right. MSNBC is a Liberal network, right. And Don Lemon -- I disagree with you on this. I don't think that he's a straight news guy. I think he's a host, an opinion host and people -- WATTERS: No, no, no. He's on camera saying he's a straight news guy and doesn't do opinion. WILLIAMS: I disagree. I disagree because he does opinion monologue. He just goes -- WATTERS: I agree. He's very opinionated, but he has the charade that he's a straight news guy. MONTGOMERY: He's very -- he's very (INAUDIBLE). Tequila shots, piercings. I don't mind that. WILLIAMS: Yes, and also -- WATTERS: See, I'm jealous with that. We couldn't take shots on Fox News New Years. They get away with anything over there. WILLIAMS: What? Can we go back for just -- WATTERS: I'm sorry. Go ahead. WILLIAMS: It's all right. But Rick Wilson is a Republican for his whole career. That's how we became Rick Wilson. GUTFELD: Oh no. He found his identity being something else. WILLIAMS: No, he's anti-Trump. He doesn't like Trump but he's a Republican. GUTFELD: He's got -- he's got a disorder. He can't change now. It's flooded his brain. I go bad. MONTGOMERY: Rick, Rick, Rick. All right, coming up coronavirus fear is ramping up in these United States as the government warns against traveling to China. We'll have more details next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WILLIAMS: Growing concerns in the United States about the fast-spreading coronavirus. It's killed more than 100 people in China. The Trump administration issuing its highest travel warning and urging Americans to avoid all non-essential travel to China. The U.S. government has started evacuating Americans from the city at the epicenter of the outbreak. Here's administration officials earlier on the possibility of more travel restrictions. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALEX AZAR, SECRETARY OF U.S. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES: All options for dealing with infectious disease spread have to be on the table, including travel restrictions. But diseases are not terribly good at respecting borders. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: And here at home, it's been getting political. Some 2020 Democrats accusing the president of making the U.S. more vulnerable to the virus. So, Kennedy, the argument is that -- what Joe Biden wrote was that this is the president, President Trump who tried to get Barack Obama to institute a travel ban. Elizabeth Warren blasted for dismantling the White House Office, the deals with medical research and pandemics. MONTGOMERY: I disagree with them, not because you know, somehow I think the President has magisterial abilities to defeat the coronavirus. I'm sure some of his supporters might feel that way. But I really feel that you need to get all of these government agencies and busybodies out of the way so these private biotech companies can come in and institute their technology and eradicate these viruses once and for all. I think that would be an incredible thing. And, and oftentimes it is layers of bureaucracy that really get in the way of technology and treatment. And until you have more cases here, you're not going to activate that critical free-market engine. WILLIAMS: But I was thinking, Jesse -- so Kennedy is making the point that people would have more faith in the private sector than the government in any case. But I was thinking, when the Ebola outbreak happened, President Obama was in office, he appointed I believe, Ron Klain as the czar. And the government put in place a good plan and they handle the outbreak. That wouldn't seem to me to be like you'd say, hey, the government did handle it. WATTERS: Well, so far so good in the United States. The CDC has identified about 32 people that have it. They've isolated them, they've tested them, and they have not seen the ability for the disease to spread to anybody else within those 32 people who were isolated. So right now, it looks like on this side of the Pacific, it's I think safer and a little bit more under control. We're still testing it. I was talking to Dr. Marc Siegel about it today. And he said, China has been lying about this thing. They've had it over there for a year, and they haven't told anybody about it. And there's been undocumented deaths, 1,000 undiagnosed people, and they've now, I guess, quarantine this one city, but people have already escaped the quarantine and they have no idea where they're going. And the World Health Organization has not yet declared an international health emergency and Dr. Siegel's point was why because the guy that staffs -- the one that makes the call on this is a former Chinese health official and they think he's getting pressure from Mainland China to keep this thing under wraps. WILLIAMS: They just -- and so the lie continues, you believe? WATTERS: Yes. MONTGOMERY: Look at what they did to the Uyghurs, Juan. I think Jesse is absolutely right. WILLIAMS: I don't doubt Jesse ever. It's about -- Dana, the last time there was all this call for travel bans quarantine. Remember that woman from Maine came back and people say, oh, she shouldn't be able to go back to Maine. But again, it seems like the fear is there, but actually, the government handled it. PERINO: I think -- yes, I think -- I think our government does a pretty good job. And I don't think that candidates from either side -- like this always happens. If there's an emergency, then you're looking for any sort of advantage. I mean, three of the candidates are sitting there in the Senate, they have no ability to even campaign so they're just lobbying whatever that possible -- everything that -- lobbying whatever they can. I always trust the taxi drivers. My taxi driver this morning, he said, people do not understand how bad this is, ma'am. They do not understand and he was just really very adamant that people needed to really pay attention to it because of the two-week incubation period. So what, if you don't show any symptoms for two weeks, how many places can people travel to in two weeks? So that's something. The other thing -- the last thing I'll mention, there's a show on Netflix. I started watching this weekend called Pandemic. It's a docu-series. It's - - it will give you some comfort that our government is really doing some good things, but it does show you how big the problem is and why vaccines are important. WILLIAMS: Do you watch horror movies? Why would you start that? PERINO: I'd like to learn, Juan. WILLIAMS: OK. PERINO: I don't mind even bringing a chart tomorrow. GUTFELD: Don't do that. WILLIAMS: I think I'd be scared, Greg. GUTFELD: OK. This is what is a bit strange about this. And I would actually say that our administration is right now doing a terrible job. And I'll tell you why. The CDC is telling people don't go to China. They're telling us don't go to China. That's half the equation. How about China coming to us? If we're saying don't go there, but you can still come here. That's idiotic. McDonald's is closing stores in China. Tibet is closing their border and traffic. Infections are doubling like every six days, and we're sitting here and we're like, well, you know what, it's not the flu. So well you know what, it's in the early stages. The scientists that are mapping this virus are super worried, right? They're watching these epicenters spread into all over Mainland China. And why is that? Because of the transit links, transportation. The -- it is all about where people are going these days, and it's coming here unless you stop it. So I do think we should consider a temporary travel ban because if we're telling citizens not to go there, why are we telling them they can't come here. I don't understand. Doesn't it seem like a stupid suggestion? WILLIAMS: But it didn't work with Ebola. We didn't have to do that, right? GUTFELD: Well, I don't know. I don't -- I'm not a scientist. All I know is I'm reading -- I'm trying to figure out what this information is -- and by the way, you know me. I don't panic over anything. WATTERS: Never. GUTFELD: Never. I've watched every pandemic from the bird flu, SARS, they tell it's huge and then it's not. But this is weird because it's doubling at a fast rate and the governments aren't telling us everything which is weird. And to your point. I didn't know that about what Siegel said. That is the truth. I would bet on it. PERINO: And the Chinese need to abolish all of those wet markets. WILLIAMS: Oh big time. PERINO: I read about that in the Wall Street Journal today. That will open your eyes. WILLIAMS: Yes. I agree. GUTFELD: They're not as fun as they sound. WILLIAMS: Coming up, why some on the left are upset with Bernie Sanders, and what Hillary Clinton just said about 2020? Gregory explains what's next on THE FIVE. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GUTFELD: So let's talk about the Democrats. Mike Bloomberg is picking up steam despite not understanding how to pet a dog. No, Mikey, you do not shake the dog's face like a human hand. MONTGOMERY: Oh, God. PERINO: He was just playing with it. GUTFELD: That's not playing. Let's see it one more time, OK. Look. PERINO: A very polite dog. GUTFELD: He's shaking his face. I think he lost the vote. Meanwhile, like that tiny scar you got from the vaccine when you're a kid, Hillary really never goes away or heals. I bet she still has the urge. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: I certainly feel the urge because I feel like the 2016 election was really an odd -- an odd time and odd outcome. And the more we learn, the more that seems to be the case. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Right now, Bernie Sanders is hot, and has the most enthusiastic base. So what if Hillary or anyone somehow knocks him aside? What do you think his voters are going to do? Are they going to vote for Mike or Joe? They just assumed vote for Trump which would be hilarious. Almost as hilarious as these anti-Sanders Dems turning on Bernie. They're attacking him for this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE ROGAN, COMEDIAN: I think I'll probably vote for Bernie. But him as a human being, when I was hanging out with him, I believe in him. I like him. I like him a lot. He's been insanely consistent his entire life. He's basically been saying the same thing, been for the same thing his whole life. And that, in and of itself, is a very powerful structure to operate from. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Now Rogan is right. Bernie has been sanely consistent, insanely consistently wrong. While America excelled, he only embrace the world's losers. But that's not what got Rogan in trouble. It's because Rogan is a comic. He's made a zillion jokes over his lifetime, some really stupid, some even awful. And in this age, that means your prime not just for canceling of your own career, but your own sins can infect others around you, like someone you endorse, say Bernie. Offensiveness becomes transmissible like a virus. Remember, hate the sin, love the sinner? It was one of religion's greatest hits. Now the sinner is the sin making forgiveness impossible, at least in this endless game of grievance whack a mole. It's not hard to see where this leads. It happened before in 2016. A guy named Trump rode in on a P.C. killing horse. If the left continues this mob action, it's going to do it again. Dana, because you're the dog expert. Was that the proper way to pet a dog, shaking the upper roof of its mouth? PERINO: Well, I think he was just playing with the dog. GUTFELD: That's not -- that's assault. PERINO: No, wouldn't say assault. But also, you want to teach kids that before you just go and put your hand in a dog's mouth, you want to like basically let them smell your hand to see if it's OK. And it's like asking permission for a hug. GUTFELD: Right? PERINO: You know that whole -- that whole -- GUTFELD: I think they should have signed a waiver. That is crazy. That -- you know that dog is in therapy now? He's got a therapy human. PERINO: Can I mention one thing about Hillary? GUTFELD: Sure. PERINO: You know, when she says, the more we learn yes about the 2016 election and why she has -- that's all about -- they still believe that Russian interference cost them the 2016 election. MONTGOMERY: And James Comey, and misogyny, and husbands telling their wives how to vote. But here, I watch Hillary Clinton and I actually have pity for her. And this week in the New York Post published an article that the FDA is approving more MDMA to be used for PTSD in therapeutic settings, which could be fantastic because Hillary Clinton clearly suffers from PTSD. And for that I truly feel bad for her because she wakes up every day, every day is groundhog day, and it is a living nightmare for her. And the only way she can wake up in (INAUDIBLE) is if she wins the election. And she has to somehow figure out a way -- before it was having to elbow Liz Warren out of the way, but she's already imploding. So she may have a wish at a broker -- GUTFELD: A brokered convention. I miss Andie MacDowell. Where is she? Maybe I better not -- MONTGOMERY: Andie, come on out. GUTFELD: Yes. Juan, by the way, Hillary then later said, to be fair, that she's will support any nominee there is. So that says she may not be running. But there could be a brokered convention and she could drop from the sky with Michelle Obama together. WILLIAMS: That's your fantasy. GUTFELD: Yes. Well, it's -- WATTERS: Among other things. GUTFELD: I don't know what that means. WILLIAMS: I was actually -- WATTERS: Women dropping from the sky. GUTFELD: Yes. Thank you, God. WILLIAMS: Be careful. WATTERS: It's not my fantasy, it's yours. WILLIAMS: Wait, wait, but whose hand is Dana have to hold here? All right, look, I was interested in what you're saying by Joe Rogan because that was interesting to me about this whole cancel culture business. GUTFELD: Yes. WILLIAMS: Because I don't think Rogan has any right-winger. No right- wingers going to endorse Bernie Sanders. GUTFELD: Exactly. WILLIAMS: That's ridiculous. I mean -- but on the other hand, people see him as part of this dark web intellect. And they think he goes off and he says as you said, some really awful jokes, homophobic racist type stuff. But the point I think is, you see this now on both sides, these purity tests. If the phone call wasn't perfect, then you're not loyal to Donald Trump. If you're not -- if you're 99 percent with him, you might as well be zero. I mean, to me, this is where politics is going. It's all like all or nothing and driven by the far left and far right. And I think Rogan, Rogan should -- the idea that he supports Bernie, I don't see that that's a problem. You know who he is. WATTERS: Well, Rogan is just collateral damage because the knives are out for Bernie because he is a bigger threat to the Democrats than Donald Trump. How did the democrats handle 2016? Think about how they'd handle a landslide loss with Bernie Sanders. It's going to be ugly. And he's going to want to abolish ICE, he's going to raise middle-class taxes, take away your healthcare and give it to illegal aliens, ban fracking. Donald Trump is going to have a field day with Bernie and the Democrats know it. WILLIAMS: Yes, that's why -- that's why he wants Bernie to run. PERINO: And the New York Times today -- and the New York Times today, there's four articles about how worried the Democrats are about Bernie. GUTFELD: All right, ""ONE MORE THING"" is up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WATTERS: It's time now for ""One More Thing."" How about a feeding frenzy, everybody? Let's see it. GUTFELD: Let's see it. WATTERS: Everybody likes it. GUTFELD: Yes, everybody likes that. WATTERS: All right, so football fans getting pumped up for the big game on Sunday, so is Frito-Lay. And they have a new combo with Tostitos. It combines Tostitos strips and avocado salsa. WILLIAMS: Avocado salsa? PERINO: Is it good. WATTERS: I love it. And you will love it too. MONTGOMERY: Brought to you by Frito-Lay. WATTERS: Provided to us by Frito-Lay. You know what also is a great combination, everybody? THE FIVE and the Superbowl. That's right. ""The Five"" is going to be live from Miami on Friday and a special show on Sunday that Greg is really excited about. GUTFELD: Yes. WATTERS: 5:00. GUTFELD: A lot of people are going to be watching that for sure. 5:00. WILLIAMS: If it's so good, why are you choking? WATTERS: Juan, it's -- that's not a choking sound. WILLIAMS: OK. PERINO: It's a -- it's a ""this is so delicious"" sound. WATTERS: Yes, it's delicious. All right, Dana. PERINO: All right, I have a next show too. Let's show this. Dana's Book Club. How cute. Here's the thing. So, over the weekend, I read this book. It's called Remember, You're Mine, an adoption story. It is written by J.S. Holmes. And Jim Holmes writes a story about being adopted from an orphanage in North Dakota. He was seven and a half months old. He had a lot of questions growing up. And he tells you about the search for his birth parents, the power of adoption, and it's a really special story. And all of the proceeds go to the children's village in North Dakota. That was the orphanage. WATTERS: It's kind of a thin book, Dana. PERINO: Well, then you'll appreciate it. WATTERS: 70 pages? PERINO: I highly recommend it especially if you have an adoption story in your own life. You can check it on Amazon. WATTERS: Juan Williams. WILLIAMS: I'd love to read that. OK, who says New Yorkers don't have a heart. Take a look at this harrowing video from Manhattan. GUTFELD: Heroin? WILLIAMS: On Sunday, a car ran over a woman here pinning her beneath an SUV. What you're seeing is over a dozen people rushing from every direction to push the vehicle off of that woman. And thankfully they did it. She was taken to the hospital, released, just cuts and bruises, no broken bones. They say life in the big city can be tough. Look at that one. It was humane and in fact lifesaving. WATTERS: Excellent. Greg. GUTFELD: Speaking of life-saving, let's do this. Greg music news. You know, if you -- here's a tip for young ones who want to start a band. You want to start a band, you need a good drummer, and a drummer has rhythm, like this little fella here. This is a duck, right? Is it a duck? WILLIAMS: If it walks like a duck. GUTFELD: If it walks -- there you go. PERINO: It drums like a duck. GUTFELD: It drums like a duck. That's a drumstick, actually. You know, I could keep going forever, but instead, I think I'm going to throw myself off a tall building. There you go. WATTERS: All right. Kennedy. MONTGOMERY: Well, let's continue with that. Ferrets always feel freedom. And there was a young -- one young man in Great Britain who quit the Royal Air Force after some difficult trials in his life, sold all of his stuff and traveled the world with his pet ferret. GUTFELD: I don't like him. MONTGOMERY: Oh, look at that ferret there in -- at the Colosseum in Rome, on Hadrian's Wall, and in front of the Eiffel Tower. GUTFELD: This is fake. MONTGOMERY: You know, we've seen a lot of Flat Stanley's but this freedom ferret has been all over the globe. They traveled for eight months, they've been to 11 countries, everywhere from the Arctic Circle to Southern Italy. I don't know which of them is more happy. I know. There are some of our -- WATTERS: Emotional support there. MONTGOMERY: -- ferret-owning friends who celebrate this man's life choices. PERINO: That's awesome. GUTFELD: We're ferret and balanced. WATTERS: Very good, Greg. GUTFELD: Not afraid. WATTERS: They're going to be here all night. Set your DVRs, never miss an episode of ""The Five."" ""Special Report"" is up next.

95,FOX,"The New York Times reports that in an unpublished manuscript, former National Security Adviser John Bolton alleges that President Trump tied Ukraine aid to an investigation into the Bidens; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" January 27, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. (LIVE COVERAGE OF SENATE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL) DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: That was Pam Bondi. She was presenting a portion of the president's legal defense team case to focus mostly on Burisma and Hunter Biden's relationship. She also showed a clip of Joe Biden who, of course, as we know, bragged about his role in carrying out the United States policy, which was at that time, to fire that particular prosecutor in Ukraine. We're going to take it around the table here because we have a lot to get to. Jay Sekulow's going to continue. We'll monitor that. We'll bring you any additional news. We'll just give you some thoughts about what THE FIVE is thinking. We'll take it around quickly. Dagen, you've been up all morning since the beginning and watched all of this, any opening thoughts? DAGEN MCDOWELL, GUEST CO-HOST: We'll get to John Bolton shortly. But this is a way for them to put a placeholder in place if the Democrats force a vote on calling Joe Biden -- John Bolton as a witness. This is a place holder to potentially press the Republicans to call Hunter Biden, even Joe Biden. I think that Byron York last week wrote that there was a growing chorus of Republican senators who are talking about trying to call Hunter Biden, including Ted Cruz. Hunter Biden is not only relevant, he's now critical. But this is also a political adventure. It has been throughout the House impeachment and now in the trial and the Senate. So, again, score some political points and point out the huge conflicts of interest that are going on in Ukraine with the work of Hunter Biden. In the meantime, Hunter Biden just in the last few days, he's tooling around Hollywood on $130,000 thousand Porsche Panamera being photographed there. And he's got an answer. He's got enough money to rent what is reportedly a $12,000 thousand a month house in Hollywood, but can't pay child support on his fourth -- soon will have five. PERINO: When I saw that report yesterday that he -- with the picture, I zoomed in because I knew somebody here would know what kind of car that was. I'm not very good on the whole car front. But I'm glad to know exactly what it is. Jesse, why don't we get some thoughts from you? JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST: Well, I think Pam Bondi just established meticulously how much Hunter was making at Burisma compared to the average family in the United States, how this is not a conspiracy theory that not only President Trump but the Obama State Department, the British, and every single media outlet in this country, then and now, have said that this gig in Ukraine by Hunter Biden. This arrangement, and his father demanding the firing, was extremely suspicious and borderline corrupt. She did an excellent job doing that. And she also established the fact that the firing just didn't come out of nowhere. It came amid heavy lobbying by Burisma lobbyists and executive to the Obama State Department before and after the firing. It doesn't look good for Joe Biden. And I completely agree that if you are a Democrat and you want to start calling witnesses, well, that's a witness. Hunter, that I don't he would withstand that kind of scrutiny when they have the bank records, the reporting, and all of what they have. And I just don't think he's going to ever have to testify. They are too scared. PERINO: There might -- yeah. I wonder about that, which is like mutually assured destruction. Does that make it that there are no witnesses? We don't know. Greg, how about you? GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: I want to state the obvious that the Republicans are obviously digging themselves out of a hole that the Dems dug all week. Eighty hours of un-criticized filibustering loathed in -- I mean, bathed in the drool of media. And what do the Republicans get? Saturday morning. When all of us fun people are walking home. You know, I didn't watch it. It's like being a comedian who gets the 3:00 a.m. spot at a telethon, you know? It's like they have to work their way out of this. I think that's why a lot of the polls have been favorable in a way, because, you know all you got was that perspective. But the bottom line, I think, is the big point. The previous week was a collection of presumptions over actions, mind- reading, more opinions and facts. The reason why the hearing was so popular was it reflected exactly what CNN and MSNBC wants, so they were -- they loved it. It mirrored their thoughts. This is going to be something different. This is the fact part of it. That's why they are showing the ambassadors talking and stating the facts, the things that Schiff had ignored. On another note, though, I will say this because we are going to talk about Kobe later in the show, but that does -- that was a horrible event that happened this weekend. And it kind of makes the stuff in some ways seem really, really silly and gross. Because what you saw yesterday was a country essentially uniting in sorrow over a really horrible thing. And this is the damage that is divisive as ever. PERINO: Tragedies certainly can focus the mind indeed. I wonder -- if you can pull up the Ken Starr comment. You have that there? I'll play this for you, Juan, and then maybe get some thoughts. Because we were sitting together but we didn't have a chance to talk about it. Here we go. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are living what I think can aptly be described as the age of impeachment. In the House, presidential impeachment has become a weapon, to be wielded against one's political opponent. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We deal with transcript evidence. We deal with publicly available information. We do not deal with speculation, allegations that are not based on evidentiary standards at all. We live in a Constitutional republic where you have deep policy concerns and deep differences. That should not be the basis of an impeachment. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: How do you they've done today effectively? JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Well, it's kind of a, you know, on the one hand and the other, Jay Sekulow when he started, the business about not addressing the Bolton issue which will come to in a moment. I think a lot people are like, how can you not do that. But then he goes on and goes and he says we are going to look at the facts. And then when he introduced one of the White House lawyers, that lawyer attempted to look at the facts. And that's where I think the Trump defense team did its best work, which is trying to say, hey, listen, a lot of stuff that the Democrats said wasn't wrong but it lacked context. There are people who said additional things that would put it in a more full picture for you. And might, in fact, lead you to think, hey, maybe the president wasn't acting wrong. Maybe in fact he was concerned about overall corruption. And it wasn't directly tied to the investigation of Joe Biden, therefore undercutting the quid pro quo. Now, we've heard though, you know, Mick Mulvaney said, you know, get over it. Foreign policy is often tied to meeting American demands. And of course, then you've heard Gordon Sondland and others say there was a quid pro quo. But what didn't impress me, Dana, was Ken Starr. I mean, I guess they put Ken Starr out there for a reason. But it's hard -- PERINO: He kind of basically laid the groundwork, saying impeachment is not a remedy that we should use. WILLIAMS: Right, but it is hard coming from Ken Starr. PERINO: He was appointed under the impeachment law statute, which we do not live under anymore. WATTERS: I thought Ken Starr did a nice job. He started off a little slowly. You have to warm up to Ken Starr. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: At first, I got a little nervous. But as you get into it and you start kind of feeling the rhythm of his voice, he's very captivating. And I would agree. He talks about the history of impeachment. And right now, we are at a fever pitch. I think in the first 150 years, we had one impeachment. Now we've had three in the last 20, 30 years or something. And he said now, traditionally, impeachment is supposed to be bipartisan. It's supposed to have -- I'm not saying it can't have a crime. But all of the writings and the rulings and the thought about impeachment, there has to be an underlying crime. And due process was shredded in the House. The Magna Carta shredded in the House. And that was really destructive to the Democrats' argument. They came in here destroying their own precedent and saying to a commander-in-chief, to a president who was relying on their own office of Special Counsel in the Justice Department's opinion, he's not going rogue. He's abiding by the opinion of the office of the Special Counsel, very talented lawyers. And he's being impeached for taking the advice of counsel in the executive branch. That never happened before. And they need to walk that back and realize this is just gross. GUTFELD: I would add one thing to this just because looking at the stock market today, which is I think is about down 450, 460? MCDOWELL: It lost almost all if not all of its gains this year. GUTFELD: So what that's reflecting is an anxiety over an issue that we are not talking about, right? So as we do impeachment every day -- (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: -- it's about the Coronavirus. GUTFELD: Yeah, exactly, exactly. I was getting there. So what would you -- I think the question is what would you rather have your government do? Because clearly, it can only do one thing, run impeachment theater for weeks and months on end, or deal directly with a global pandemic that could be doubling every six days. MCDOWELL: This actually goes to something about the argument against impeachment and removal. It -- was this a threat to our national security. No, but the Coronavirus is. The government has one job and that's protecting its people. And I do think it will come down, Juan, that all these senators, particularly the Republicans will have to look and say will we vote to remove a president nine months before an election when a majority of Americans are not in favor of that removal. WILLIAMS: Wait a minute. We just had a Fox poll -- anyway. (CROSSTALK) MCDOWELL: -- average. WILLIAMS: President Trump's legal team on the Senate floor right now making the case against impeachment, as you know. This comes as the fight over witnesses intensifies yet again. This time, it's over claims in former national security advisor John Bolton's new book. The New York Times reporting, that in an unpublished manuscript, Bolton alleges that President Trump tied aid to Ukraine to the investigation into the Biden's. The report fueling a new battle over testimony among lawmakers, and here is the president denying John Bolton's claims earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I haven't seen the manuscript. But I can tell you nothing was ever said to John Bolton. But I have not seen the manuscript. I guess he's writing a book. I'm not sure. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: Dana, let me ask you. Do you think this moves the needle on Republicans voting to call witnesses? PERINO: It's possible. It's possible. But I think there's -- we've got a ways to go because before you even get to a vote about witnesses, you have another two may be even a day or so, depends on how much time the president's lawyers want to use. So it could. But maybe we'll find out more about all of this before then. Even if we do get to witnesses, as Jesse was pointing just a moment ago, you could get to a point where it's clear there's going to be witnesses and there's going to be all the witnesses. It's not going to just be John Bolton, Mick Mulvaney. It's going to be like -- you won't get to do the no witnesses like the House did. A couple of things on this, as far as I know, John Bolton, I was his spokesperson when he was trying to be appointed -- when President Bush had appointed him to the United Nations and the Democrats blocked that. They called him a liar, all sorts of things. Remember that. They're not calling him a liar now. I also am -- I'm for people writing books. But I also have long believed that the best way to write a book if you've had an opportunity and a privilege to work in an administration is to do so after a term is over. Either when the president is no longer the president, I think folks come in the middle of it always end up being -- looking like it's for personal gain even if it's not necessarily that way. And that they're always taking the wrong way and they hurt the very person that gave you the opportunity to work in the White House, typically, because the media will always try to find a way to see if there is a way to divide. Third thing is, though, that I predicted this on Friday. I said I would not be surprised if by Sunday night there is another one of these little leaks. Because the Democrats might realize that they know that the president is going to be acquitted, but they are going to figure out a way to make it very difficult for them as much as they possibly can. And this happens on Sunday night. But here's what I would also say. That might be wrong. But the White House, any White House, has to figure out a way to get much more coordinated. Like, everybody needs to know that, oh, heads up, everybody. John Bolton's manuscript just landed in the National Security Counsel's desk, who needs to be there to know about it? But they didn't do that. Apparently, it looks like they didn't do that. And so that means it looks like they were caught a little bit flat-footed today. WILLIAMS: All right. Dagen, you know, one thing that strikes me is picking up on what Dana just said about her accurate prediction, that we had the Lev Parnas thing come out. We've then had the OMB email about the money being withheld after the phone call. We have the GAO saying this was illegal. Now we've got Bolton and he's naming names. It's like a drip, drip, drip. GUTFELD: Exactly. (CROSSTALK) MCDOWELL: Where do you go? Where do you go? Do you know why we are laughing? WILLIAMS: Tell me. MCDOWELL: You tell him. WATTERS: No, I mean, it's obviously a coordinated stunt, Juan. WILLIAMS: Wait, wait. You said -- but wait, in fact, Bolton and his lawyer have said they didn't review -- (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: Here's why I'm not buying this Bolton stuff. I've been around not that long, but long enough to know this is a hatchet job. How many perfectly-timed anonymous cherry-picked revelations have been leaked perfectly-timed to help the Democrats to The New York Times? MCDOWELL: Jim Comey. WILLIAMS: Are these the same anonymous sources that said that there was Russia collusion? I mean are these the same anonymous people in the NSA who tried to draw up this whole whistleblower complaint? GUTFELD: So we don't know who leaks it. We know why. The timing tells you why. This is in order to, like, to nail the president. But nobody's actually seen the actual -- (CROSSTALK) MCDOWELL: -- could actually defend the president. GUTFELD: I mean here's the deal. People are freaking out on the right about this. And I'm going, like, it vindicates Trump because he's telling everybody what Trump really thought, which is was, like, Ukraine was corrupt. And he was -- on behalf of the Dems, and this is what he's trying to do. But now this is just like another bombshell. The media has TBD, terminal bombshell disease about -- is a bombshell, but it's nothing. But the bottom line is nobody knows what it is. WATTERS: Well, here's what I think it is, because they actually lied about what they say their revelation is. They do not get to page four until they tell you the meat of the conversation that Bolton had with the president. This is a direct quote from The New York Times, OK? This is supposed to be the good stuff. He, the president, quote. ""Preferred sending no assistance to Ukraine until officials had turned over all the materials they had about the Russia investigation that related to Mr. Biden and supporters of Mrs. Clinton and Ukraine."" So this was not about Burisma or Hunter. This was about them releasing information about election interference and collusion by the Democrats against the president. So that's why this murky leak is probably from some guy that maybe saw a manuscript, spun it to The Times, and they can't corroborate because they don't have it. PERINO: Can I make a recommendation on something? Do you have something that's -- (CROSSTALK) MCDOWELL: I was just going to say conspiracy theory. PERINO: OK. I don't have it -- I never have those. So I think that when you do a book in the middle of a president -- especially if you had top- secret clearance. You have to get it cleared from the government. So he sends it in. That's the appropriate procedure to do. Well, they haven't cleared it. But the president of United States has the ability to clear it if he wants to. So they could release that chapter, or they could tell John Bolton, like, we are good with your book, like, whatever. They could release it, and then -- and trying to do that before this question -- (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: He was on Amazon today. I mean how's that not a conspiracy? PERINO: That's my conspiracy theory. It has nothing to do with the impeachment. It's the publisher. (CROSSTALK) MCDOWELL: -- categorically state they had absolutely no coordination with it. But I will point this out. So if you think that your author is going to give away what's in the book, you need to pre-sell that book -- expletive, before he actually testifies potentially. This is you striking while that iron is hot and this is the moment. And by the way, this is not number one, Kobe Bryant is number one. So this doesn't even do sales. But they're trying to sell it ahead of possible testimony. WILLIAMS: Let's just get back to today. I don't think there's any question. He tied President Trump to a quid pro quo. And this is a Trump official. That's why -- (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: Not Burisma and Hunter, though. WILLIAMS: Up next, brand new details on what Jesse's talking about, the helicopter crash that killed NBA star Kobe Bryant. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WATTERS: The president's legal team is arguing against impeachment on the Senate floor right. And we're going to monitor it and bring you any big developments. But in the meantime, as the world mourns, we have brand new information on the tragic death of Kobe Bryant. We are learning what was happening inside the helicopter before the terrible crash that killed the NBA legend, his daughter, and seven others. Jonathan Hunt is alive in Calabasas, California, with the latest. JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Jesse, good afternoon to you. Since first light, investigators have been on scene here in Calabasas where that helicopter went round and down, and job one for them this morning was to start the grim process as a look at the crash site of removing the bodies of the nine people who died in the helicopter, working alongside the recovery personnel. NTSB investigators looking for the precise cause of the crash, they are looking very closely at weather as a major factor. There was dense fog over Calabasas at the time. And the pilot, Ara Zobayan, had requested special visual flight rules to aid him as he flew through the fog. Listen here to part of his conversation with air traffic control. Listen here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BURBANK AIRPORT TOWER: Follow THE FIVE freeway. Maintain special VFR -- correction, special VFR conditions at or below 2,500. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Maintain special VFR at or below 2,500, I-5 northbound, 2-echo-X. (END VIDEO CLIP) HUNT: Shortly after that conversation, the pilot made a final turn to the southwest, having requested what's called flight following, tracking of his helicopter to ensure that he didn't come too close to any of the aircraft. Listen again now to the very final communication from air traffic control. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SOCAL APPROACH: Two echo x-ray, you are still too low level for flight following at this time. (END VIDEO CLIP) HUNT: Too low level for flight following. Just seconds after that, it is believed that the helicopter slammed in to the hillside here. Meantime, fans across the sports world paying tribute to a man they considered a legend, a man many of them consider a brother, a man many of them considered an inspiration. Listen here to some of those fans. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm numb. I'm numb right now. He's my hero. I grew up with Kobe. He's of my age. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's in my prayers. I'm lost for words. You know, I'm still having a hard time with it. So all I can do is just, you know, hope that his family, you know, wish them the best. I can't imagine what they're going through. (END VIDEO CLIP) JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF CORRESPONDENT: Tomorrow night, the Lakers are due to play the L.A. Clippers at Staples Center, so commonly known as the house that Kobe built. It will be a deeply emotional evening. Jesse? WATTERS: Jonathan, thank you. And yes, and they had the Grammys last night, Juan, at the Staples Center, the house, the Kobe built. And they had the cameras pan up to the rafters where his jerseys were retired and everybody came together and sang and, and there's a lot of love there last night. WILLIAMS: I think there's a lot of love across the country. And it's not that you know, he was a perfect man. He had that terrible case but I just - - I think it's really touching how people have reacted to this because he was 41 years old. The idea that his daughter died he was -- he was coaching his daughter. He really, I think had changed his image for the better. You know, I'm an NBA fan and as are you, Jessie, 20-year career, 18 time All-Star. He comes from Philadelphia, never went to college, but he was a sensation in high school and then a sensation right away in the NBA. And you know, for me, one of the things that always struck me is, everybody talks about him scoring like 80 points in Toronto one night, last game he played, he scored 60. But I think that he was five or six times All-NBA Defensive Team. WATTERS: Yes. (INAUDIBLE) defender. WILLIAMS: And the intensity of him as a competitor comes through. That guy cared. WATTERS: And that's what everybody is saying. They actually went to Tiger Woods as he was getting off 18 yesterday. He just heard the horrible news and they went to him with the microphone. And he said, the guy is probably the fiercest competitor he's ever met. MCDOWELL: It also reminded me because you struggle to come to grips with it, you know, just having lost my mother, it's very -- it's very raw. And I think people feel that. But it's a reminder of how a sports team or a transformative sports figure not only unites your family, but connects you to your friends, ties you to a community. And I don't think people go to look, look for talking heads are people who wear makeup for a living to tell them what this meant to them. They already know. And you get that from perfect strangers just riding the bus as I did. WATTERS: Yes, it makes you think, Greg, you mentioned at the top of the show. WATTERS: Well, we have to remember too that there were three families devastated in this. I can't even -- I don't know how you can like assess the scale of this misery for everybody involved. It's a devastating event and it puts everything in perspective and reminds you that everything that you have can be gone in an instant. I was -- when I was reading this tragedy, next to me -- next to that article was another article on the Web site. I won't say which paper. Model -- the headline was model remembers trauma of trying on clothes at Abercrombie and Fitch. And I'm thinking to myself, perspective, perspective, the words trauma are placed in the right perspective when you see something this horrifying, and it makes your life look well, like maybe I don't have it so bad. WATTERS: Dana? PERINO: I would just say, just to wrap it up, obviously, grief comes in waves and it could last for a long time. And one of the things I've been learning more about him -- I don't really follow basketball, obviously, you all know that, but he had really committed himself to being a person that people looked up to. And it is a reminder of the -- of the power of one person. If you commit to something, you can really make a big difference and he certainly did. WATTERS: He sure did. All right, more of ""The Five"" coming up. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (LIVE COVERAGE OF SENATE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL) PERINO: Hi there again. We're going to break back in. This is ""The Five."" Eric Herschmann has been presenting the President's legal defense and continued to talk about Burisma, the Biden's, and the Obama administration. They're still on the floor. I'm just going to get some final thoughts from ""The Five"" before we turn it over to Bret Baier. So Jesse, let me go to you for -- just wrapping it up here. WATTERS: OK. Well, I thought that was a good inversion of reality -- inversion of reality presentation by the defense counsel there. So they're saying the most corrupt company and Ukraine is paying millions of dollars to the V.P. son, and the V.P. is in charge of looking into corruption in Ukraine, and then fires the prosecutor investigating the son's corrupt company. And then you have Obama whispering about flexibility needed by the Russians to buy himself time to get a political advantage in an election year that jeopardizes national security with regard to missile defense and they played the soundbite of the debate of Barack Obama scolding Mitt Romney for how dare you say Russia is our number one foe. And then the Democrats saying this is such an urgent threat, they go on vacation after they launch impeachment. And then they wait another three weeks until after the Super Bowl, or the -- was it the NCAA championship game. And then finally, and I learned this, and I thought I knew everything. I didn't know this. Donald Trump put eight holds on Afghanistan, Central America, South Korea, Pakistan for all host of reasons regarding corruption, not doing what's in America's best interest. So this happens all the time, except this time, they thought they could nail him on it. PERINO: Now, there's a slight difference, though, which is I don't know -- I mean, if they can tie other people to all these other countries and asking for an investigation, but -- WATTERS: Well, Hunter, and James Biden, and a lot of Biden brothers have been working in a lot of different countries if you read his book. PERINO: I know. And also, Juan, to that point, President Obama and his team had gone to the Vice President's office and said, we have some concern here because their instincts like doesn't look good. WILLIAMS: Correct. But nobody argues with that. The argument is that they didn't say there was anything illegal or wrong, and they didn't ban it. They looked into it and said nothing. And I think Joe Biden said today, he's not playing this game, because he just didn't do anything wrong and nobody has accused him of doing anything wrong. And that's why I think this is the weakest part. I think it's stronger when they try to confront the facts and say, here's what the Democrats left out. But this stuff looks like you're just trying to, you know, pull people's minds away from the fact that this is an impeachment of President Trump, not Joe Biden. PERINO: Look ahead a little bit if you could, Dagen, to tomorrow, where the President's legal defense team is still going to have some time on the clock, though they might not use all of their 24 hours, but they're going to probably continue this tomorrow. MCDOWELL: So their audience of -- the defense teams audience, it just isn't the American people and particularly the senators, it's also President Trump. Can we expect a little more ""zaz"" out of their performance, like a secular Pat Cipollone? Because this is -- I mean, they're presenting the facts. But again, a little more passion, a little more passionate defense of the President of the United States. PERINO: What do you think it goes from here, Greg? GUTFELD: Well, I'm looking forward to hearing Alan Dershowitz. I thought that was today, but maybe not. I think the media is going to continue to frame the story that when Trump requests an investigation on corruption, that's actually into election interference. So that's the way they're going to present the story. The problem is Bolton has just backed it up saying that Trump has always been concerned about the Ukraine meddling in 2016, so that kind of blows that to shreds. Although we really don't know because we haven't even seen the book yet. I'm looking forward to it. PERINO: And we also have all this other breaking news that is happening, especially there's additional cases around the world, not in the United States, but of the coronavirus, the stock market, we're taking a look at that. We have of course the Kobe Bryant and the death of nine people and that helicopter crash. Everybody's covering that. And of course, there are other things happening like the we haven't even talked today. It is a week from today that Iowa will have the first caucus of the nation for the 2020 election. WATTERS: Yes. Isn't Bernie Sanders ahead in Iowa in the latest couple polls? Wow, you can see Bernie win in Iowa, and then he's ahead in New Hampshire poll, and then Juan is going to start sweating bullets, because it's going to be a civil war and we're just going to love every minute of it, Juan. WILLIAMS: Well, you know what, you should get some points of disagreement or delineation among Democrats at this juncture. But I must say, I think I'd be sweating the Tuesday after because that State of the Union. Can you imagine, Trump trying to give State of the Union and this is still going on? WATTERS: Well, that's why they're going to vote for -- GUTFELD: That's why the impeachment, it's always about trying to handicap Trump. That's all it's about. WILLIAMS: No, it's not. MCDOWELL: I can't quite play button up the Bernie Sanders phenomenon. Haven't they learned anything from the Republicans? The more you go after him, the more you target him -- PERINO: And the more you say he can't win. MCDOWELL: Yes. The more you energize his base, and people look at him and go, he's consistent. PERINO: All right, thanks, everybody. Set your DVRs. Never miss an episode of ""The Five."" Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

96,FOX,"Warren's plan to wipe out $640 billion of student loan debt and make college free is not sitting well with voters who worked hard to pay off their loans; reaction on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" January 24, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Republicans still hope to wrap this up so quickly that it could be done by the end of next week. We shall see. In the meantime, I'll see you tomorrow. Here comes The Five.  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Juan Williams along with Katie Pavlich, Jesse Watters, Dana Perino, and Gregory Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City. This is the five. Democratic House managers are making their final arguments in the impeachment trial of President Trump. Tomorrow, Saturday, it's the President Trump legal team's turn. The president's lawyers will get to respond to the week of attacks from Democrats. Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  REP. JERROLD NADLER (D-NY): This presidential stonewalling of Congress is unprecedented in the 238-year history of our constitutional republic. It puts even President Nixon to shame.  REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): If the truth doesn't matter, we're lost. No Constitution can protect us. Right doesn't matter anymore.  REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): President Trump tried to cheat. He got caught. And then he worked hard to cover it up.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: Partisanship has been running high all week and it looks like neither side is willing to break from their position.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): Yesterday's arguments by the House managers was precise, was dramatic, was emotional.  SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): I don't know about you but it became mind- numbing after a while.  SCHUMER: I look around at the Republican members, a lot of what they are hearing, they don't want to hear. They don't want to hear the true facts.  GRAHAM: I got the general point you are trying to make the fourth time you told me. So, they are over trying their case, and I would just urge them to not do that, because eventually it gets just hard to follow.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: Jesse, tomorrow, I think people are trying to figure out exactly how the president's team begins. Because as I understand they are going to have just about two or three hours beginning at 10 a.m. going forward. What do you expect?  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, I expect amazing performances by the defense team, Jean.  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Dazzling.  WATTERS: Dazzling. A thrill is going to go up my leg. I want to talk to you in a language that only you understand, Juan, and that is the language of polling.  WILLIAMS: Good.  WATTERS: Because the first poll came out from ABC News/Washington Post after all this garbage we heard all week and guess what, Juan?  WILLIAMS: What, what, what?  WATTERS: To use your words, guess what.  WILLIAMS: Guess what.  WATTERS: Fifty-one percent say do not remove the president. Only 45 percent say it. Fifty-eight percent say he is getting a fair trial and his approval rating is at 47 percent. So, like we saw in the House, the longer the American public listens to these Democrats drawn on and on and on, support for impeachment drops. Now the Democrats have put all of their political capital on impeachment. They didn't do it with health care, they decided not to rebuild America, they decided to not talk about loans, they went after political revenge and they are going to pay a price for it. They didn't read the room because this country was so exhausted for three years. Investigation after investigation and finally when Mueller said no collusion, everyone in this country kind of exhaled. And what did the Democrats do? They teed up a swing with the whistleblower and put us all through this again. Force feeding us hearing after hearing, constitutional crisis after crisis. And at the end of the day, 17 percent, that is the approval rating for Congress, which is horrific. They didn't put one single fact witness on in the last six months to say the president committed a crime, or the president should be impeached. Remember those videos the House hearings all of the Democrat witnesses themselves said, no, I didn't witness a crime, I didn't see anything impeachable. And that's on tape and you will see that tomorrow. Americans watch so much television. When you promise to deliver the goods, a smoking gun, and you don't deliver they're just going to turn the , and that's what has happened. To lead with an abuse of power article is so vague. Everyone can interpret that whichever way they want. It's so flimsy. And then obstruction by asking a judge to get involved? Everyone American knows when you have two parties, they're in dispute, you go to a judge and he settles it. That's not an impeachable offense. If you see this from a big picture perspective and you're watching Fox, because Fox is the only network that is going to tell you the truth about this, there are no principles on the Democrat side because Jerry Nadler himself voted against the legal aid to Ukraine.  Joe Biden himself is on tape bragging about a quid pro quo. Hillary Clinton herself paid for an agent to dig up dirt on the political opponent in an election year.  WILLIAMS: Wait, wait, wait.  WATTERS: So, at the end --  WILLIAMS: This is what you will make as the case tomorrow morning if you were representing the president?  WATTERS: They should just play The Five.  WILLIAMS: So, don't -- yes, that's what they should do.  WATTERS: And then there's like audio visual presentation.  WILLIAMS: Wait, wait, wait. Can I -- can I second that? I think that's exactly what they should do.  PERINO: That would be awesome.  WILLIAMS: That would be awesome.  WATTERS: We can do that.  PERINO: We should tape an extra special one for them tonight.  WATTERS: Yes.  WILLIAMS: Why not? We can do that.  PERINO: I'll stay. I'll stay.  WILLIAMS: All right. So, Dana, the other breaking news today was ABC says they have a recording, apparently made by Lev Parnas, that has him --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: What a guy.  WILLIAMS: -- at a dinner with the president, and the president saying, let's get rid of Marie Yovanovitch, who was the ambassador to Ukraine at the time.  PERINO: It seems to me that these are well-timed little leaks and that there will probably be some more. I wouldn't put it past somebody to have some other sort of thing or tape by Sunday night, going into Monday morning when people start to pay attention again. So, but I do -- you know, the White House basically said that -- I don't remember. They said they didn't know him beforehand, and now they're like, well this is not a big deal because she could've been fired anyway, et cetera. It will be something I guess that they try to bring into it. But remember, the House went to the vote for impeachment with the information and evidence that it had at the time. And then they did -- they rolled the dice to see if the Senate would actually complete their homework, and the Senate, especially the so-called moderate members which are moderate now means if you are polite. But they're -- even Lisa Murkowski is saying, wait, you didn't go through the courts.  KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes.  PERINO: It's afforded to all of us to be able to do and so I think that the obstruction article is very weak and that's probably what they are arguing right now. I felt like the summary by Adam Schiff was just a kitchen sink summary. it's like he threw everything in there. All the grievances. This is a grievance trial rather than an impeachment trial. And I feel like it was making just the election argument and they kept saying that the president is going to do bad things in the future, that's not what a trial is supposed to be about. And I think that if you're arguing about things that you are worried about what he might do in the future, there is a remedy for that for you and that is to try to win an election in nine months.  PAVLICH: Yes.  WILLIAMS: So, Greg, what I was struck by was the support for the close by Adam Schiff last night. I just heard lots of people talking about it. Schiff said something to the effect of, if you don't respect the truth, if you don't understand what's right, then the Constitution can't protect us, the founders can't protect us. What is your take?  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, I didn't watch it. I have a lot of people that are saying how wrong it is. Like there's this the new criticism right now from the slobbering cheerleaders is that there is something wrong with you --  PERINO: Yes.  GUTFELD: -- if you find it boring --  PERINO: Yes.  GUTFELD: -- or repetitious. It's like a director blaming the audience --  PERINO: Yes.  GUTFELD: -- when the movie flops --  PERINO: Yes.  GUTFELD: -- because their movie is four hours long and nobody wants to see heaven's gate. It's old, old statement. But, so, you are the problem. By the way, my favorite, I saw something today in the green room, it's the only time I watched it before our show was Sylvia Garcia saying it was a cover-up in plain sight. A cover-up in plain sight. It's not a cover-up if it's in plain sight. The point is, I go back to what Dana said yesterday, which was let's get high later. That was --  WATTERS: Wow.  GUTFELD: You don't have to listen to the lawyers because it's all opinions.  PAVLICH: Allegation.  GUTFELD: There are no fact witnesses, as Jesse says, it's what all judges tell jurors. You listen to the witnesses who were there, you don't listen to the lawyers because the lawyers are spinning and spinning a story. And you have to remember this, it's the most important thing you should take away from my blathering voice, these lawyers, we are poisoned from the start, OK? They are the main players from three to four years ago vowing to impeach Trump. These are the same people running the show. Would you take that seriously? Should the media take that seriously if all they were doing was waiting to do this for three to four years? You have to refuse to listen to their opinions and arguments if you know that's the case. It's poison. It's a bad batch of reheated opinions.  WILLIAMS: All right. Well, Katie, the president he's been tweeting up a storm this week. He set a record for tweeting. Today he tweeted that the impeachment hoax is interfering with the 2020 election, but that was the idea behind the radical left do-nothing Dem scam attack. They always knew I did nothing wrong, Katie.  PAVLICH: Well, they would allege that he has done lots of things wrong. But he is fighting back on that. Look, it does damage to the Democrats in terms of their primary process. It's all beneficial to Joe Biden, who nobody except for Lindsey Graham and Republicans in the Senate seem to want to look into. But the politics of this have always been at the forefront. Adam Schiff, who was the lead impeachment manager on this, try to make the argument today that this is all about the Mueller investigation. Which if you are a Republican senator or even someone like Joe Manchin who is a Democrat sitting and listening to this argument, you are going, this is a really bad sequel the last three days of the really bad Mueller testimony we saw a year ago. It proves what the president has been saying all along. The Mueller investigation and now this Ukraine impeachment trial that's moving forward was all about the 2020 election and trying to bloody him up to damage him and to gain what they could, politically out of it because they weren't, didn't have anything else.  WILLIAMS: All right. Coming up, the intense battle over impeachment witnesses. It's ramping up. Plus, what President Trump is now saying about the impeachment trial. Next on The Five.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PERINO: The battle over potential impeachment witnesses rages on. Also, I think it's ramping down, but anyway, I don't want to get too far ahead of myself. Democrats are digging in on their demand for John Bolton to testify and Republicans continue to push for Hunter Biden to do the same. And Senator Chuck Schumer weighed in on that debate.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SCHUMER: Hunter Biden has nothing to with this. And by the way, and people forget this, the Republicans could call Hunter Biden on their own. They have 53 votes. You know why they don't? Because they know that it will just confirm to every American that everything the president is doing, has done in this whole sad saga, everything the president's lawyers are doing, everything the Republican senators are doing is just political. They call in Hunter Biden, someone totally unrelated to the charges against the president.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: Meanwhile, Adam Schiff is continuing to get high marks from the media.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST: I don't think any of us knew that it would be an impassioned sort of, (Inaudible) there from Congressman Adam Schiff.  DON LEMON, CNN HOST: Very emotional closing there from the lead impeachment manager.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It was very strong, it was passionate, it was thoughtful, it was cogent. It was all those things.  LAURA COATES, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: His emotional appeal to a sense of what's right. To a sense of what is right for the country.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You heard a powerfully emotional, direct statement to the Senate.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: And President Trump is taking issue with the fact that his legal team has to start their defense on Saturday. Quote, ""Looks like my lawyers will be forced to start on Saturday, which is called Death Valley in TV."" But we won't tell Fox & Friends that because a lot of people watch Fox & Friends. I -- we tease this segment, Katie, by saying that the call for witnesses is ramping up. I actually think for the few senators that were on the fence it feels like it's ramping down basic -- based on sort of the smoke signals that they are sending.  PAVLICH: Yes. And there's two different reasons why. The first is that Democrats keep repeating their same argument. You had Lindsey Graham saying today, if you told me four times, it's twice too many. They're heard everything and they're looking at it and going, you don't have a case and you're begging us to do all of this legal work for you so that you have more to talk about to drag this out. If Mitt Romney as reported is dying throughout this process, I doubt that he and the others who are on the fence with the moderates are going to want to extend this any further. And it's just the matter of what the relevant is here. The House called the witnesses that they said were important, they didn't call John Bolton and go through the court system to force him to testify. And if they want to go down that road of trades, they've also said they don't want to do that either. This argument they're making is that Democrats are the only ones who are allowed to call witnesses, that's not going to fly. And Hunter Biden, I'm sure, may not be called as a witness for impeachment but based on what Lindsey Graham said today, he may be called to testify in a Senate judiciary committee hearing --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: For some --  PAVLICH: -- about Ukraine for more oversight on that issue.  PERINO: So, that means, Juan, I guess it that won't end. But if the Democrats over the weekend start to realize, like some of those poll numbers that Jesse talked about in the a block, that the interest is waning, that the numbers aren't moving and they look like they're not going to get the witnesses, do they just decide to get this over with as quickly as possible and get back to the campaign trail?  WILLIAMS: Wow, no. I mean, first of all, I just disagree with the premise. Let me just say that the same Washington Post poll Jesse was talking about, finds that two-thirds, 66 percent of Americans think in order to have a fair trial you should have witnesses, you should be able to introduce evidence.  WATTERS: Republicans don't want to see Hunter testify.  WILLIAMS: Please.  WATTERS: Whoever (Ph) wins the power.  WILLIAMS: And then, I might -- listen, if you look at this, you know, do Americans think that the president did something wrong? It's like 63 percent, including a third of Republicans. Now the point, and I think this is the point that Jesse was trying to make, a lot of people said yes, he did something wrong but I'm not sure that he should be removed from office.  PERINO: Impeached. Right.  WILLIAMS: So that's the difference. But you have a high percentage of people who want witnesses and that creates, Dana, public pressure. It's pressure, not only on the Senate as a whole but it's pressure, specifically, on the moderate Republicans.  PERINO: Yes. But that pressure would, I think dissipate pretty quickly. The news cycle moves so quickly.  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: If they decide not to do witnesses, the Democrats will probably cut a bunch of ads against the Republicans but is that going to matter?  GUTFELD: Yes. Two points. One about the witnesses. The argument by the Dems for witnesses is a joke because it's not your place, shut up. You had your chance. Right? You boasted you had an airtight case. Too late. And your choice of witness is simply backfilling your three-year obsession so there's no point even discussing it, it's not going to happen. So, the montage that we played that the media is swooning, I don't see how the media cannot step aside and wonder why they like it. It's because the show is for them. The reason why they like it is it's designed for them. Impeachment is the birthday clown for the brats and the party hats known as the media, the trial, another analogy, is like the hotel black light, right, that reveals the stain of bias on the media mattress.  WILLIAMS: Thank you very much. Yuck.  PAVLICH: Wow. Thank you, Greg.  PERINO: Did you want to mention anything about your new hairdo?  GUTFELD: No, because I find that it's making quite -- creating quite a storm on the social medias.  PERINO: Yes.  GUTFELD: So, I'm just letting it grow out.  PERINO: It's getting dead reviews.  GUTFELD: I'm letting it grow out. It's not quite on the level of Dobbs.  PERINO: It's not a wig.  GUTFELD: It's not -- well, unlike Jesse, this is real. This isn't some kind of meaty.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: Do you, Jesse, do you feel like Greg is trying to copy your hair cut?  WATTERS: A little bit, but you know what, I'm flattered. Because what did they say about copying? Highest form of flattery.  PERINO: Indeed.  GUTFELD: CNN --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: Do you know what they say?  GUTFELD: CNN is going to write, during impeachment, The Five discusses hair.  PERINO: Yes, we did.  GUTFELD: That's your story.  PERINO: Jesses, do you have a prediction on how witnesses vote is going to go?  WATTERS: There will be no witnesses and here is why. There's no moderate senators under any pressure to call witnesses. The pressure would be from their base if they voted to call witnesses and make this thing drag out for another month. You know how long this impeachment trial would take if they try to subpoena John Bolton?  PAVLICH: Yes.  WATTERS: It would take until June. And that's what the Democrats want. They want to drag this out and make this thing long and painful.  PERINO: But even then, I don't think that the chorus would -- I think the president would prevail on an executive privilege, Juan.  WATTERS: Right. But then you still have this ongoing Senate trial forever.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: There is no executive privilege.  PERINO: Sure, there is.  WILLIAMS: There is no executive privilege.  PERINO: Why?  WILLIAMS: Because he doesn't work for the president anymore. He's not there.  PERINO: No, no, no. You're protected for that work that you did at the time.  (CROSSTALK)  PAVLICH: Yes.  WILLIAMS: No. But he can come now just like he can write a book.  (CROSSTALK)  PAVLICH: But he can't talk about -- no, that's not how it works.  WILLIAMS: He is he is not covered by executive privilege at this moment. That's a bogus argument.  WATTERS: No, no, no.  WILLIAMS: I tell you --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: The president has invoked it, Juan, just Trump is being impeached for doing it.  WILLIAMS: No, no, no. While this person, national security adviser works to you, Bolton is gone.  WATTERS: Bolton doesn't want to show up --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Yes, he said he wants to show up.  WATTERS: -- unless he --  WILLIAMS: Bolton said --  WATTERS: No one is going to show up. Bolton said if he's forced, he'll go.  GUTFELD: It doesn't matter.  WILLIAMS: You know what I think? We should wait on Rudy Giuliani to produce the evidence he promised this morning.  PERINO: All right. Let's have it.  WATTERS: OK. I'll trade that for the whistleblower, deal?  WILLIAMS: No. I'm not making a deal.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: He won't shake.  WILLIAMS: This guy is --  PERINO: We're going to move on. Ahead on The Five, President Trump attends the March for Life and it's been one year since the media attacked the Covington kids at that very same event. Stay tuned.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WATTERS: Donald Trump became the first-ever sitting president to attend the March for Life rally in Washington today. Here he is earlier.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Democrats have embraced the most radical and extreme positions taken and seen in this country for years and decades. Every life brings love into this world. Every child brings joy to a family. Every person is worth protecting.  (APPLAUSE)  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: And it's been one year since the media viciously smeared the Covington kids who attended that same event. CNN ending up having to settle a lawsuit with Nick Sandmann, but apparently there is no self-awareness at all at that network. Chris Cuomo tweeted this about Greta Thunberg. ""Why do these Trumpers think it is OK to go at a kid?"" Really, Chris? Who would ever go after a kid?  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  CHRIS CUOMO, HOST, CNN: The face-to-face encounter, the man Nathan Phillips apparently wanted to defuse the tension and he walked up to do exactly that. And surely the kid, Nick Sandmann, he doesn't seem to be afraid, but he did make a choice and that was to make it into a standoff. That was not a good choice.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: Wow.  WATTERS: Well, that caused CNN a lot of money. Katie, explain the significance in your opinion to the president speaking personally and physically there for the first time ever at a March for Life rally.  PAVLICH: Well, the March for Life has been going on for almost 50 years, it's gotten bigger and bigger every year. And I think as the dynamics of abortion politics change, younger generations are actually more pro-life than then their predecessors as the science people understand what abortion actually is. And the left has never been afraid to go to the extremes on abortion when it comes to politics and fund-raising. And it's interesting to see the president saying, I'm not afraid of controversy, I'm going to jump right in, support this people who yes, are going to knock on doors and come out for me in 2020, but also not just allowing the left to have a monopoly on the conversation. And every single Democrat who is running for president right now will not talk about or condemn late-term abortion. There is no room there. When it comes to these types of politics the right is always seen as the extremists but yet, when you look at the way that the left has handled these issues, they don't want to get into the nitty-gritty of what these things actually mean. The president isn't afraid to go there. I don't see it as necessarily controversial that he go there -- going there, I'm glad that he's embracing a movement that has been around and led by women for nearly five decades.  WATTERS: Do you expect the president in the campaign later in the year to dive really hard into the abortion issue?  PERINO: Well, there's a couple of things that are happening this year that will be interesting. On March 4th there is going to be a hearing at the Supreme Court on a significant abortion-related case that's coming up through the courts through Louisiana. And what's different now is that you have Kavanaugh and Gorsuch --  WATTERS: Yes.  PERINO: -- on the courts. So, in some ways one of the things the president said today is, you know, the judges have made a difference and there could be more to come on that. I think that it also served to solidify his report. He has earned their devotion and these are people that are active voters and they're not the kind that just will donate the limit. They will actually go out and knock on doors and make sure -  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: Very passionate.  PERINO: -- that their neighbors get there. However, I do think that their - - as the way the politics of this works, Planned Parenthood is going to dump a bunch of money into it and Cecile Richards, who used to run Planned Parenthood started a new group called Super Majority. They are committing a huge amount. And one of the things that this does is that it increases the fervor on both sides.  WATTERS: That's right. Greg, are you feeling any fervor?  GUTFELD: Yes, I am. You know, Chris Cuomo said, How dare you go after a kid? Jesse, how dare you go after a Cuomo? That is worse than attacking a child for a number of reasons. Look, why does this story keep happening? Like you see this with Kavanaugh, you saw it with Covington, and you saw recently with the Virginia gun rally where they predicted death and disorder and nothing happened. The media keeps, keeps committing these offenses because they never -- they're never forced to learn. They never learned from the mistakes until Nick Sandmann's suit, thank God. But to me, I think -- I think it's really about class. The media is an elite class that is separate from the rest of America. These are people that are overly educated, right? They -- most of these people went to journalism school, which is thoroughly unnecessary. And for the media to improve, to actually improve, they have to open their doors to people who do not go to journalism school, who may not go to college at all, because there was a time when people were journalists who didn't have a college education. It wasn't that long ago. But now you've got these completely isolated, secluded elite snobs who look down at people who are pro-life, or Catholic kids, or whoever, and just see them as aliens, space aliens that they can degrade and mock. And that's how you get these stories, that's how you get the gun right story, that's how you get every time -- every time a story is wrong, it's because of that class difference.  WATTERS: Yes, Juan, how do you think the mainstream media treats the pro- life movement?  WILLIAMS: I think it's incredible to me that no matter what I'm watching, or a radio station I'm listening to, or newspaper I pick up, they gave equal coverage to the pro-life movement or March or a pro-choice, movement or march. It's always treated as yes, we're going to cover both sides. But if you look at the numbers, ABC poll, Monmouth poll, Wall Street Journal, 60 percent of Americans think that abortion should be legal in all or most cases. And in fact, Gallup has new numbers out that say that there's more discontent right now with abortion law in the country. Why is that? More people who are pro-choice feel that they're more and more restrictions being put in place and abortion, and they don't like it, so they say they're not happy right now with abortion law in the country. That's where the energy and the passion is coming from. But to me when I see the president do this, you know, as someone who's been around awhile, I saw Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan didn't do this. George W. Bush, his dad, none of them did it. Why did -- why did -- why does Donald Trump think that this is good? It divides the country --  WATTERS: Maybe it's in his heart.  WILLIAMS: Excuse me. Let me finish.  WATTERS: Maybe he believes truthfully about this.  WILLIAMS: This is -- I don't doubt that those people felt fiercely. All of us sitting here might have some strong opinion, but the president of the United States hammering this culture wars issue to his political benefit is expedient and does not -- this is a guy who was pro-choice for most of his life.  GUTFELD: Not if he changes his mind. You know, you can't read everybody's mind, Juan. If he believes it or not, you don't know that, so that's a stupid argument.  WILLIAMS: Why is that stupid? In fact when he put Gorsuch --  GUTFELD: Let me finish.  WILLIAMS: -- Gorsuch and Kavanaugh on the court, what did he say, oh, I'm not going to talk about abortion, now he's talking about it.  GUTFELD: In the old days -- in the old days, pro-choicers had a unique way of looking at abortion. They look at it the way people looked at war. It's evil and wrong, but sometimes it's necessary. That's how pro-choicers used to look at it, and it used to be almost the middle of the road. I'm a pro- lifer, but I can understand abortion is like war. Pro-choice has changed so much that if you voice any of the slightest thought that a late-term abortion is bad, you are wrong. The extreme -- pro-choice has a change to such an extreme level that you have to run out there and exclaim that abortion is great.  WILLIAMS: And you know who's changed, pro-life people because guess what, Republicans used to be big advocates of family planning until you got into a situation where they saw, there was some political benefits to this.  PERINO: Republicans and conservatives have been for -- in fact, over the counter birth control. I mean, that is --  WILLIAMS: I'm saying, I you go back to --  PAVLICH: And Planned Parenthood --  PERINO: Yes, but go back how far?  WILLIAMS: Well I'm just saying, last 50 years what you see is the big change has come from the right not the left  WATTERS: A very divisive issue, obviously. Liz Warren gets called out by a voter over her radical plan to just cancel student debt. See it next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PAVLICH: Elizabeth Warren has a controversial plan to wipe out $640 billion in student loan debt and make college free. But that proposal is not sitting well with voters who worked very hard to pay off their loans. Check this out.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I just want to ask one question. My daughter is getting out of school I've saved all my money. She doesn't have any student loans. Am I going to get my money back?  SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA): Of course not.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So you're going to pay for people who didn't save any money, and those of us who did the right thing get screwed.  WARREN: No. It's not like you got screwed.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Of course, we did. My buddy had fun, bought a car, went on vacations. I saved my money. He made more than I do. But I worked a double shift, work extra. My daughter work since 10. So you're laughing at her.  WARREN: No, I'm not.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That exactly what you're doing. We did the right thing, and we get screwed.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PAVLICH: Well, it's -- you know, Dana, Elizabeth Warren is so indignant there when she says, of course, you're not going to get your money.  PERINO: Of course not. So a lot of these progressive ideas sound really great on -- when you first hear them. Like we're going to -- like free college for everyone. And -- but then they melt upon the first follow up question. Like, well, how are you going to pay for that? And like, what about this? I think about somebody who's close to me who just recently paid off her student loans from a university, and that was 10 years of -- she had no extra spending money, but she paid it all off. And she's really proud of the fact that she did that but she's not going to get anything more. And she's in competition with all these other kids as well.  PAVLICH: You know, when we hear a lot of arguments about fairness from the left about it's only fair to get rid of the student loan debt, it's only fair to give free college to everybody while taxing everybody else. But it's really not fair to guys like that who worked for themselves or for their kids to be able to go to college and get out debt free without being a burden to other people?  WILLIAMS: Well, I'm in the same group with him. But I must say I have a different attitude about it, which is like if you think about something like healthcare, Katie, you say, well, you know, they used to be that the elderly in this country, if they didn't have the money, they were in trouble. But now we have social security, now we have Medicare, Medicaid so should we go backwards? No, I think we want to improve as a society. We want to do better. And I think the society benefits from a higher level of education, in my opinion. So I just think that this is an improvement. But I understand his frustration. He did the right thing. He's a good man, and he was a great family man. But I don't see why that's an argument against helping people who are burdened by student loan.  PAVLICH: So, Greg isn't the government -- the government power policies like the one Elizabeth Warren is proposing responsible for all the student loan debt by making it seem like everyone should go to college and get degrees that don't actually pay off the debt that they -- it's gone in the first place.  GUTFELD: (INAUDIBLE) college administrators. There are more college administrators than there are professors at this point.  PERINO: And they get paid a lot.  GUTFELD: But to your point, you know, progressive worst enemy is a follow- up question. And if she didn't have an answer for -- that's like the most obvious question. You're going to be faced by somebody who already paid. So they're going to be pissed off, they're going to be angry, and they're going to say, why is it I did the right thing and I'm getting punished and the person who's not doing the right thing, you're benefiting? So if you don't have an answer with that, Trump is going to roll over you. You better find another nominee. Also, I mean, who is this benefiting? It's benefiting a specific class, right? This is -- this is benefiting the educated middle to upper class, gender studies major. If you want to really cancel debt that affects all Americans, why not car to car loans, why not to that? Everybody has got a car. Why wouldn't we do that? Because at that point, you will never get another loan.  PERINO: Or a credit card debt.  GUTFELD: Yes, a credit card debt. Why don't you do that? There's no logic to this. She is actually just promising something free hoping that she gets votes. It'll never happen. Jesse.  WATTERS: Well, I think we all know when a father comes up to you and dad is mad, and dad has done the right thing, and he's upset, you don't laugh at dad. You don't -- you don't just blow off dads because dad's done a lot of hard work to get where he is today and make sure his family does better than he did. And that's what she was doing. She's buying votes, except she's only buying votes from debtors. She's not buying votes from savers. If you save, you're a sucker, you got screwed. And then you're just mad at your neighbor who didn't save and spent like an idiot and got bailed out. And that's why Trump got elected in the first place is because Wall Street and the rich people get bailouts, poor people get handouts, and everybody in the middle that did the right thing gets nothing.  PAVLICH: Yes, and she didn't even try to sympathize with him.  PERINO: Yes, like she's -- she could have said that it's a complicated issue. It's like, wow your daughter. And why not pivot like, oh your daughter, she's so wonderful. What does she want to study? Like --  (CROSSTALK)  PAVLICH: Of course, you're getting screwed, man. That's the way it works.  WILLIAMS: You know what comes to my mind as I'm listening to this is the prodigal son, you know, where the guys stayed home did all the work says, why are you going to celebrate this guy went off and had such -- well but that's not the issue as the bible tells you. The issue is a community trying to do better --  GUTFELD: It's in the Bible.  WATTERS: Juan is calling the Bible, good. Do you want to open the floodgates on that one, Juan?  WILLIAMS: I'm all for it.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: Bible Friday, Juan.  PAVLICH: There is no such thing as free. We'll leave it right there. ""FAN MAIL FRIDAY"" is up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: All right, ""FAN MAIL FRIDAY."" Answering your question. Let's get - -what?  WATTERS: I think they probably -- Flo Rida probably rip that off.  GUTFELD: Yes, I think so.  WATTERS: Yes.  GUTFELD: All right, first -- this is a good question. Who was the first famous person you met? Jesse? Me?  WATTERS: God, first famous person, oh, Dr. J.  GUTFELD: Oh, wow. You asked for an autograph and he said no.  WATTERS: No, that's another athlete. That was Alonzo Mourning.  GUTFELD: OK.  WATTERS: No, I got Dr. J's autograph in a sixers game in the tunnel and then I lost it. Yes.  GUTFELD: I have a similar story. I lost something in a tunnel as well. Dana?  PERINO: I actually think that is John Elway.  GUTFELD: Really?  PERINO: Former Bronco's quarterback. I don't think he'll remember me though.  WATTERS: I don't think so, Dana.  GUTFELD: He's going to call her right now. And he goes, Dana, I love you. Katie?  PAVLICH: I can't remember but I almost ran over Geraldo Rivera in the University of Arizona library on accident. He was walking for a book signing and I turned around and he was right there and I almost ran him over. So, I guess I kind of met him then.  GUTFELD: You kind of met him. It almost killed him.  PAVLICH: Almost, yes. Sorry, Geraldo.  GUTFELD: Yes. It could be worse. Juan.  WILLIAMS: It depends on your definition of fame, because I mean, when I was like a rookie reporter during college at the Philadelphia (INAUDIBLE) I met the mayor, Frank Rizzo and stuff like that.  GUTFELD: That's kind of famous.  WILLIAMS: But then I remember one day, Martina Navratilova was walking through the newsroom. I thought, wow, that's Martina Navratilova. That's awesome.  GUTFELD: Yes. I would say my mom because, you know, she's my mom.  PERINO: She's famous.  GUTFELD: So that makes her famous. But Kent McCord and Martin Milner, Adam 12. I went to a car show at the Cow Palace in South San Francisco. And you know, they always have celebrities, and I waited in line.  PERINO: I have another one. It's Larry Wilcox.  GUTFELD: CHiPs.  PERINO: From CHiPs, because he -- my mom went to high school together and at -- the at the high school reunion, I met him in Rawlins, Wyoming. And he -- I think he watches the show. Hey, Larry.  WATTERS: Hey, Larry.  GUTFELD: Larry, what was his name in CHiPs?  PERINO: John.  GUTFELD: John, I don't know. Erik Estrada, though. He was my favorite CHiPs.  PERINO: No, Larry Wilcox was better.  GUTFELD: No, Erik Estrada is my favorite CHiP. Let's just leave it there. OK.  PERINO: Don't listen to him, Larry.  GUTFELD: Well, I said leave it there. What's happening to me. Frenchi, of course, what emerging technology are you excited about and why? Katie?  PAVLICH: Jetpack. I got to Uber myself away from the traffic on a jetpack. But preferably one that includes your bodies you're not freezing.  GUTFELD: Interesting. I like that.  PAVLICH: The jet pods.  GUTFELD: A little -- a little tube. A little tube.  PAVLICH: Yes, a little flying -- it's basically an individual plane.  GUTFELD: Juan, any technology you're looking forward to?  WILLIAMS: Well, I love voice recognition so that you can assist -- you don't have to push buttons or program things. Like I think it would be great if I didn't have to want to go upstairs write in my password repeatedly. If I could just say something --  GUTFELD: What is that password?  WILLIAMS: I'll tell you a little bit later.  PERINO: He's not saying it here.  GUTFELD: Just say it and I'll record it. There is a lot of voice recognition going on now, Jessie.  WATTERS: So I discovered this app. So you punch this thing in and then all of a sudden, you can order groceries, and then they're delivered to your house.  PERINO: You just discovered that?  WATTERS: Yes, it's amazing. I don't ever have to go to the grocery store again.  PERINO: We have it for 10 years.  WATTERS: It's emerging.  GUTFELD: That -- no, that's here. You need a dictionary --  WATTERS: I'm a little behind the times with technologies.  PERINO: I have to say on the voice -- on the voice texting, Emily Compagno sent me a text yesterday and I responded to her using voice text because I was walking and then -- it was scheduling question. And I looked at it this morning and it had me saying the F-word to her. And I then apologize to her. I didn't say that. I'm excited for that, the thing you'll have in your laundry room where that folds the clothes for you.  GUTFELD: Yes, that's good.  PERINO: And they're all being uniformed.  GUTFELD: I think it's called a maid, Dana. Don't pretend you don't have one. You know, I would -- my e-mail I sent to you about what happens when artificial intelligence -- I'm for -- I'm pro-artificial intelligence. Imagine when they -- when they start painting. Because when you think about it, like artificial intelligence, if they start painting, every painting is going to look like a picture because it's going to be perfect. You wouldn't be able to notice. Like a painting of you will be a photograph, right?  PERINO: I hope it'll be better.  GUTFELD: So then what happens is then you realize how crappy all human art is. Like the Mona Lisa doesn't look like a woman. It's a terrible painting. But art -- if A.I. had done that lady, you'd know exactly what she looks like.  WATTERS: All right, Greg.  PERINO: Maybe it wasn't a lady.  WILLIAMS: Wait a second.  GUTFELD: You all knew what I'm talking about, America. All right, ""ONE MORE THING"" is up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WILLIAMS: Time now for Friday ""ONE MORE THING,"" and I'm going to go first. You know what, life is full of surprises. So please keep your eyes open as Toni Colombo is busy filming a rainbow on a Hawaiian tour boat. Yes, that was a giant humpback whale that jumped out right next to the Maui charter tour boat. Columbo was recording the colorful rainbow over volcanoes on behalf of the tour company when she got much more than she expected. Talk about filling two bucket list items in one moment. I think Miss Colombo got it. Awesome. All right, it's Greg's turn.  GUTFELD: Yes, all right, the ""GREG GUTFELD SHOW."" It's tomorrow night at 10:00 p.m. with Johnny Joey Jones, and the comedian Michael Loftus, Kat Timpf, and Tyrus. That's 10:00 p.m. tomorrow night. It's going to be awesome. No impeachment. Also, let's do this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Animals are great. Animals are great. Animals are great.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Anyway, you know what, in these polarizing times, you know how I love to unify people and bring people together. So let's take a tip from these little critters here. Look at this. You know, at the end of the day when impeachments over, what do you need? You need a little hug, a little hug. See, Liberals and Democrats -- well, Liberals and Conservatives, Democrats and Republicans, dogs, cats.  WATTERS: McConnell and Schumer.  GUTFELD: Fox and CNN. Look at that. Isn't that great? That's the nicest thing I'm ever going to do on this show.  PERINO: I mean, it's pretty sappy. If others -- if somebody else had that, you'd be going --  GUTFELD: I would -- yes, I would be making the puking noise.  WILLIAMS: All right, Jesse.  WATTERS: It's all frank for you. How about some mom texts? Do we have an animation? There you go. OK, number one. ""Jesse, you cannot appear on THE FIVE and not have followed all testimony up until 4:59 p.m. Irresponsible and uninformed, your business is the news."" How did you know I didn't --  PERINO: I love her.  WATTERS: All right, number two. ""Missed the show. Did you behave with a modicum of respect? We were at the film 1917."" And yes, I did. Number three. ""That grammar usage was really cringe-worthy. Her and Beto?""  GUTFELD: Oh my goodness, Jesse.  WATTERS: Number four. ""Scary times honeybun. Nothing is black or white. Don't land in one place and end up holding on for dear life.""  PERINO: Great advice.  WATTERS: Wow, should I change my position on impeachment? And then lastly, ""OMG, let me pray for you. I know Nancy Pelosi is already."" You know what, I pray for Nancy to watch ""WATTERS WORLD"" at 8:00 Eastern Saturday night where I will be having Tucker Carlson talk about all this stuff. And we found where Hunter Biden was.  WILLIAMS: Cool.  WATTERS: All right, so watch that.  WILLIAMS: Dana Perino.  PERINO: So we had some travel coming up and I just wondered if you guys would like this. This is an elephant in Sri Lanka and it appears to have acquired a taste for the high life at this hotel. It just like wandering around in the hotel, an Asian Bull Elephant. His name is Nada. And he calls jet wing his home. It's pretty cute. I now have it, a new episode of I'll Tell You What Podcast just posted FoxNewspodcast.com.  WILLIAMS: Katie, go, Katie Pavlich.  PAVLICH: The expensive security deposit, they're not going to get back for that elephant. OK, so after a two-year deployment in South Korea, one Army soldier decided to surprise his mom. Last Friday, he surprised her at a pep rally at the DM Therrell High School in Atlanta where she works. L.J. Williamson ran into her arms. He's a U.S. -- wait -- ran into her arms. U.S. Army specialists Shakir Aquill. And she couldn't stop crying. You can see them hugging there. They had a long time apart, and now they're together. She could not stop talking and --  PERINO: Very sweet.  WATTERS: Say something negative, Greg. I dare you. I know you want to.  GUTFELD: I know you're tempting me. I know. Don't say it.  WATTERS: All right. That's it for us. Have a great weekend, everybody.  Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2020 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

97,FOX,"CNN political analyst and former Clinton lackey Joe Lockart admits he made up a conversation between Republicans. So while CNN makes goo-goo eyes at Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., one of their political analysts, former Clinton lackey Joe Lockhart, admits he made up a conversation between Republicans. He said on Twitter, “Overheard convo between two Republican Senators who only watch Fox News. 'is this stuff real? I haven't heard any of this before. I thought it was all about a server. If half the stuff Schiff is saying is true, we're up [bleeps] creek. Hope the White House has exculpatory evidence.'"" After the tweet gained much praise, including from The Washington Post's barely-hinged Jennifer Rubin, Lockhart later added: “Ok maybe I made up the convo, but you know that’s exactly what they’re thinking.” CNN'S JOE LOCKHART MOCKED FOR CALLING ON TWITTER TO INVESTIGATE CRUZ FOR TWEETING DURING IMPEACHMENT TRIAL So, why does this matter? Well, first off, he just revealed the entire anti-Trump platform with, ""You know exactly what they're thinking."" The last three years of panic have been brought on by the media believing they can read minds -- allowing them to conclude the worst intention in every act. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER So they scream for the 25th Amendment, accuse everyone of racism and openly demonize Trump supporters because they ""know"" what’s in everyone’s heads. Yet, they're always wrong about reality. Maybe it's their ill-advised mindreading that leads to these predicted catastrophes that never come. That's what makes them sad and nervous.

98,FOX,"Clinton says nobody likes Bernie Sanders, hints that she wouldn't endorse him if he wins nomination; Tulsi Gabbard sues Hillary Clinton for 'Russian asset' comments. This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" January 22, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Hello everyone. I'm Dana Perino, along with Dagen McDowell, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5:00 in New York City. This is THE FIVE. We are looking live at the Senate floor. Don't worry. We're not going through the whole thing. It is day two of President Trump's impeachment trial. Democratic House managers, they're making their opening arguments. And our reaction to impeachment battle is coming up in just a minute, we promise. But first, there's a lot happening so want to get caught up with somebody who can tell us everything pretty quickly, Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram has the latest. Chad?  CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good afternoon, Dana. They started at about 1:00. Adam Schiff, he consumed most of the time here this afternoon, about two hours. Jason Crow, Democrat from Colorado on the floor right now. He's been making his case and says they're going to take a break. Here's something that Adam Schiff said. He said, quote, ""We cannot allow a president to withhold aid from an ally for illicit aid in an election campaign. I hope we don't have to get over it."" Here's Chuck Schumer, the Senate Majority -- Minority Leader, he continues to push for documents.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  CHUCK SCHUMER, SENATE MINORITY LEADER: I was so impressed with the House managers' case. It was on the facts. It answered the questions. It talked about why we had witnesses and documents. The president's lawyers never answered the question of witnesses and documents.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERGRAM: Republicans continue to focus on the impeachment managers. Question their credibility in the Houses as process. Lindsey Graham doesn't think the president should cooperate at all.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What the House managers were proposing yesterday is basically to destroy the institution of the presidency as we know it. If I were the president, I wouldn't cooperate with these guys at all. I wouldn't give them the time of day. They are on a crusade to destroy this man.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERGRAM: Now, what we're having here is the Capital is still reeling over a rebuke that was issued last night of John Roberts, the Chief Justice, to both sides. He thought some of their language got a little too feisty on the floor. This happened around 12:40 in the morning here. And Josh Hawley, he is a Republican Senator from Missouri. He clerked for Chief Justice Roberts and said that it was a little bit out of character. You know, back in the 1999 trial with President Clinton, Chief Justice William Rehnquist never infused himself into the trial here. But Republicans are contending that the language by Jerry Nadler, one of the impeachment managers, was a bridge too far the way he criticized the Senate. And if he's trying to convince senators to come around to their position, he said he really didn't win any friends last night, back to you.  PERINO: All right, Chad Pergram, thank you so much. So it was another split screen day. President Trump is overseas in Davos, Switzerland. The president this morning going after Democrats over this whole impeachment thing.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: Jerry Nadler, I've known him a long time. He's a sleazebag. Everybody knows that. I've known Jerry Nadler for a long time. He's opposed many of my jobs. I got them all built, very successfully built in New York. But -- so we have yet another fight. Isn't it amazing? The other side has so lied. I watched the lies from Adam Schiff. He'll stand to look at a microphone and he'll talk like he's so grieved. These two guys, these are major sleazebags. They're very dishonest people.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: So that's Trump. We're going to have one more sound bite for you. This is Senator Schumer ripping into the GOP this morning.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SCHUMER: Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans don't want a fair trial that considers all the evidence. The impeachment trial of President Trump begins with a cloud hanging over it, a cloud of unfairness. The White House defense were unprepared, confused, and totally unconvincing. White House counsel resorted to the kind of histrionics you see on a Fox News evening broadcasts rather then any sober-minded argument that could persuade thoughtful senators.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: Ouch. What do you think, Greg?  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Are these people trying to kill America? I mean, watch -- I mean, Adam Schiff, the thing that I realized that speaking for any longer for 10 minutes is like a slow gas leak. If you're listening to this impeachment and you haven't opened your windows, you're probably dead right now. They are trying to wear us down with incessant babble. And Trump is right. These are all opinions. This can't be a trial if it's all opinions, because they're basically just saying they're mind reading. It's a historical impeachment, and that it's become something so trivial that now anyone can do it, right? So you're going to see it if the Democrats are not doing to Republicans and the Republicans will do it back to them. When they get into office, it's just going to be what -- the Democrats broke the seal on this. So I have an analogy. Impeachment is now like a tattoo. In the old days, they were exotic, right? If you saw somebody with a tattoo, you stared at it. He was a war vet or a biker or possibly both. Now, they're on bass players. They're on sorority sisters. Tattoos can be found on middle-aged suburbanites at their Peloton class. So what was once exotic is now mundane. That's what impeachment is. Impeachment has -- it's not going to be something like sequestration or government shutdowns that are going to be -- it's going to be coming background noise and meaningless. One more point, and what is exhausting to me is how people keep comparing this impeachment to the Clinton impeachment. Republicans do it to Dems, and Dems to its Republicans. They cancel each other out. So it's meaningless to keep going back and going they said this then and say this that. The bigger question is how can you have this comparison, it's because the politicians that were there then are still here now. And that should infuriate you. We're seeing the same faces that we saw in the 90s we're seeing now, and yet nothing is better in government. It's only worse. The world has progressed. We have less poverty, cheaper food, you know, reductions in major diseases. But we have the same jerks doing the same crap.  PERINO: I don't know. I think the Republicans are probably pretty happy that McConnell was there in 99 and is now there leading this.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: I hate term limits, but that's for another day. What about you in all of this, Jesse?  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: The Democrats have done a lot of dumb things in Trump's first term. But putting Adam Schiff on television for two straight hours might be up there with the dumbest. The man looks like a rotten dandelion. It's like listening to him is like being in the room when someone is vacuuming. You just can't wait for it to stop. He belongs in the back office, not selling a thing. He's the kind of guy that tucks his t-shirt into his mom jeans, and that's true if you Google it. Anybody can see all he wants to do is desperately be a senator. And that's why everybody in the media loves him because he lies so well. And he just got caught in another lie, falsifying text messages from Lev Parnas. He lied about that. The whistleblower, the transcript, Russia collusion, and let's not forget he got caught soliciting revenge porn by another man, disgusting. He needs to see a psychiatrist. This is what's happening. It's so boring. Senators are falling asleep at their own Senate trial.  PERINO: They can't even have coffee.  WATTERS: They can't even have coffee. The networks are dumping out because it's so boring. They're going to the soap operas. The ratings are down. MSNBC is not getting a boost from this. They had people telling us there was going to be a recession, World War III, and Trump was a traitor. None of it came true. And so now, we're supposed to not understand why everyone is yawning through a Senate trial. Zion Williamson is making his NBA debut tonight for the Pelicans. That's what Americans care about. They don't want to see boring politicians with bad haircuts read their notes in front of a horrific backsplash.  GUTFELD: Backsplash.  WATTERS: If you have high crimes and misdemeanors, if you had a smoking gun, if you had killer bombshell testimony, you don't think Republican senators would throw Trump overboard? They split with Trump before he was even elected after Access Hollywood, after he went after John McCain. They bucked him on Syria, on the wall, on NATO, anytime he opens his mouth. Charlottesville, S-hole countries, they're running to the cameras denouncing him. If the Democrats had a case, it would've been a slamdunk deal. They would have been convicting him in a heartbeat. Remember they were going to convict him if Mueller had found collusion. They had their fingers in the air for two years. But the Democrats, they get their managers in there and they've totally miscalculated this thing. They're insulting the very people that they're trying to persuade. It's like a prosecutor goes and tells a jury if you don't agree with me to convict, then you're guilty of a cover-up, and you're complicit in the crime that the guy on trial is -- on the stand for. That's not how this works. Chief Justice Roberts is sitting right behind them and they're trashing the judiciary. Every single president since Washington has claimed executive privilege. And Trump is being impeached for doing it?  PERINO: He hadn't even done it yet.  WATTERS: When Obama claimed executive privilege and now he wants to get rid of Trump for doing it. Let's remember. Trump didn't claim privilege once during the Mueller investigation. Handed over witnesses, thousands and thousands of documents, and they still tried to go after him. So now when he knows it's a set up, he's going to I'll see you in court. And they're going to say no, you're obstructing. The only thing he obstructed is Hillary getting into the white House and Biden getting in there in 2020.  PERINO: OK. So Juan --  GUTFELD: What about the backsplash? I liked it.  WATTERS: You like that?  PERINO: Juan and I were sitting upstairs together. And we all said -- it looked like the United Nations. If you think about the U.N., they have the same kind of granite right behind there, so.  (CROSSTALK)  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: We don't have a choice on that shot because it's not a Fox camera. It's the Senate cameras. And they don't do this very often.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Because -- the viewers would be distracted by all the people seated behind the person at the podium. So they take the shot from above, Dana. But I agree with you. It looks to me like, you know, I think it was Trump who complained about the seating at the U.N.  PERINO: Yeah. They need to step it up a little bit.  WILLIAMS: They could. They could. They could. But contrary to what I was just hearing from Jesse, I thought that Adam Schiff was quite impressive today.  WATTERS: Oh, did you?  WILLIAMS: And I thought that it wasn't just me. In fact, I heard -- Schumer, Charles Schumer, the minority leader in the Senate, came out and said that he thought that Schiff was powerful, succinct, and complete.  WATTERS: That's surprising.  WILLIAMS: And what struck me about this is that yesterday we were having arguments about, well, if there are witnesses and there's additional evidence, why are you Democrats calling for it? Because you said you have a convincing case in these two articles of impeachment against the president. When Schiff comes out, and for two hours, I think he does a masterful job of presenting the evidence to support those two articles of impeachment. But I think it goes one step farther, which is to the whole public perception of is this a fair trial? Or is it the case that simply you have a Republican majority and they decided they're going to acquit President Trump and allow him to remain in office. And even today, we see in the polls. The polls are -- you know CNN, Monmouth, Politico, 49 percent, convict and remove, 49, 47, the pluralities are all convict and remove.  PERINO: But it's been that way, Juan.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Yes, so it hasn't moved. But on the question of witnesses and evidence being allowed, it's like 70 percent plus of Americans. And I think that's what the Democrats are playing to, that this is not fair that the Republicans just want to shut it down.  WATTERS: I bet some of those percentages wanted to hear from witnesses, want to know where is Hunter. Where's the whistleblower? I bet some of those polled are Republicans, saying we want to hear from shifty Schiff.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: Dagen, I thought Bret Baier had a good question yesterday about the polls. He said if they ask the question how many would like this to just be over with and get back to doing the people's business. It would probably be like 88 percent.  DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Absolutely. We can talk about the witnesses because we got plenty of time. He wasn't, what'd you say, a vacuum cleaner. It's more like a leaf blower. It's like the most annoying sound. It reminded me of Ms. Othmar, the teacher in Charlie Brown, where Adam Schiff was like Hamilton, Kennedy, Reagan. He even -- he mentioned Ronald Reagan. And I was Peppermint Patty sitting in front of my TV set like this with the head back and the drool, and then I was like straight. That was the only thing that he said that was absolutely convincing in any of this. And in terms of John Bolton, they don't want to call John Bolton. John Bolton is like the patriarch of the Neocon movement. He's got a super pack and a book coming out. They don't want to call him. All they want are the Republicans on the record to vote against witnesses at a later date.  PERINO: Can I play some sound from President Trump about the very person we're talking about, John Bolton?  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: I would rather go the long way. I would rather interview Bolton. I would rather interview a lot of people. The problem with John is that it's a national security problem, you know? You can't have somebody who is at national security. And if you think about it, John, he knows some of my thoughts. He knows what I think about the leaders. What happens if he reveals what I think about a certain leader, and it's not very positive, and then I have to deal on behalf of the country? It's going to be very hard. It's going to make the job very hard. He knows other things. And I don't know if we left on the best of terms. I would say probably not.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: Let's play sound bite number six. This is Murphy on witnesses.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If they continue to obstruct the journey for truth, if they don't allow for any document protection or any witnesses, there is going to be hell to pay back in each one of their states.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: You know John Bolton pretty well.  GUTFELD: Yeah. We lived together in the 80s.  PERINO: It's amazing.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: Does the left not remember how they've treated John Bolton over the years, and they think he's going to save them?  GUTFELD: Yeah, it's not going to happen. That's another fantasy in the Avenatti universe of fantasies. The one thing is that last point that he just made, which is interesting, that mounting a defense is obstruction. You don't -- when you're mounting a defense, you don't give them avenues for more information, hardly. You block it out because that's what they -- you don't do what the prosecution tells you to do. What you're basically saying is, like, if you don't do what the prosecution tells us -- wants you to do, then that's obstruction. No, that isn't. They defense can do whatever the hell they want, and they shouldn't give them anything. They should give them nothing. They should have the person go up there and say yep, this ain't impeachable and then shut it down. By the way --  WILLIAMS: Can I respond to that?  GUTFELD: Yeah.  WATTERS: Because I would like to hear what you think about this. So if the president -- this is where I get stuck, Greg, is if the president is really innocent. He says it was a perfect call and he said that's why he released the transcript, and we heard that yesterday from Pat Cipollone, the president's lawyer. Well then, why would you say to your staff and to people at Justice and at the State Department, don't talk because Congress is a legitimate and equal arm of government conducting a constitutional procedure for impeachment.  GUTFELD: Every great lawyer will tell you don't fall for that trap. Because all they're trying to do is to get you to open up for some other information that they will find. And you don't have to -- they could have called the witnesses. They didn't. So let's -- so you don't have that responsibility. I also want to -- he said is this a fair trial. A, it's not fair, and B, it's not a trial. It's not fair when you present a hoax video that has Trump saying I can do anything I want. And you take out of context to imply that he's a king when in fact, all he was talking about was firing and hiring at the executive which everybody he can do what he wants. And it's not a trial when it's just people mind-reading and expressing opinions. Finally, when you watch this, it's boring. We all know it's boring. And that's the real reason why they are impeaching Trump. These are all really, really boring people up against a phenomenally interesting person they see as a threat. This is a fat, bloated cat trying to hack out an orange fur ball that has made their life a living hell. That's why you got to root for Trump. He's Rocky in this fight.  WATTERS: It is also important to remember the president is presumed innocent.  GUTFELD: Yeah.  WATTERS: Juan likes to think he's guilty and he has to prove that he's innocent. It's not how it works in the American justice system. The other things that -- Congress they did this investigation, and they serve up this half-baked case.  WILLIAMS: Today, it's not half-baked.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: Then why are you asking for more witnesses?  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: What we saw today from Adam Schiff was a masterful, comprehensive --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: So you don't need more witnesses.  WILLIAMS: Apparently not.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: -- this is not just about this phone call. I wanted to play sound bite number three, if we could, because this all goes back from the very beginning. As we know that they wanted to prosecute Trump on the Russian collusion case from way back when, before Robert Mueller was even finished. Here is Schiff today on that very issue.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Special Counsel Robert Mueller testified before Congress that Russia interfered in the 2016 election in a, quote, ""sweeping and systemic fashion to benefit Donald Trump's political campaign."" Mueller and his team found that, quote, ""the Russian government perceived that it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome."" They also found that the Trump campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts. And just as he solicited help from Ukraine in 2019, in 2016, then candidate Trump also solicited help from Russia in his election effort.  PERINO: Jesse, the thing about that is that it doesn't talk about the conclusion that Mueller reached which was no collusion.  WATTERS: Right. Conclusion, no collusion, and let's not forget Hillary Clinton paid for foreign interference, very expensive foreign interference. That was interference by foreign powers and a warrant which she purchased to illegally spy on the president. So obviously, the president is a little cautious when it comes to Ukraine because it was involved in the collusion and the guy who was running against him. Joe Biden was in the administration that spied on him. So it makes perfect sense to be a little suspicious with what's going on. The other thing is this is about Susan Collins, like you said the other day. They want to put her on the record as taking a vote against witnesses. They got her on the Kavanaugh vote. They want to get her on the impeachment vote. And that's the only scalp at the end of this four year deal they they'll have gotten if Susan Collins loses her seat.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Jesse, if you picked up the papers this morning the real news was that Rob Portman, Republican from Ohio, a conservative, was the leading voice in the Republicans caucus to say to Senator McConnell, you know what, we should make sure that this is a fair trial.  (CROSSTALK)  MCDOWELL: That is so much noise about nothing. Do you know what? This went exactly like it was expected. Andy McCarthy said when Mitch McConnell introduced the revolution on Monday night. He said this whole thing about putting the House evidence into the -- make it a part of it.  (CROSSTALK)  MCDOWELL: Thank you, Juan. It's pro forma that it's going to happen. Oh, we turned two days of testimony into three days, and somehow that's a big deal.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: But that was the easy thing.  MCDOWELL: It's hogwash. Adam Schiff, I wrote down what you said earlier, commanding performance? This man couldn't sell peach pie and sweet tea to South Carolinians on July 4th. That's how bad he is.  (CROSSTALK)  MCDOWELL: You know what he's trying to do? He's trying to suck the defense team into arguing the facts that he's laying out about Russia, about Ukraine. All they need to get up there is proof that these are not impeachable offences, particularly article two. You have the right to protect the power of the executive branch. He's not a member of the legislature. He was acting as the president of the United States. And then the abuse of power, it's a big turkey stuffed with a bunch of you know what that comes out of your -- you know what.  WILLIAMS: You know what, Dagen, I mean, your point is that you think terrible things about the Democrats, terrible things about Adam Schiff. But, you know, one thing we haven't discussed is the administration's lawyers have not made an effective defense on the basis of the facts. In fact --  (CROSSTALK)  MCDOWELL: They haven't presented their defense yet.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Yesterday, the Democrats took advantage of yesterday and all the votes on those motions, they took advantage to basically make their case. And what did we hear from Jay Sekulow? Oh, the Democrats are back. They never argued the facts. Boy, that -- if I was a juror.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: You don't have to.  PERINO: The Senate impeachment trial continues. We're going to continue to talk about it. You'll find out why Democrats may allow Hunter Biden to testify. We have that for you next on THE FIVE.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WILLIAMS: Democrats making their case against impeachment right now on the Senate floor, but they better be careful what they wish for, because the impeachment trial is putting the Biden family under the microscope. Senate Democrats are reportedly toying with the idea of trading Hunter Biden's testimony for John Bolton's. Some Democrats are pushing back on that proposal.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This isn't like some fantasy football trade. This isn't we will offer you this if you give us that. We will offer you a witness that is irrelevant and immaterial.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Focusing on Hunter Biden just furthers the entire scheme that Trump put forward.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The bottom line is that the witnesses should have something to do with him, direct knowledge of the charges against the president.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think it makes a mockery out of the whole impeachment. Hunter Biden does not have firsthand information about what the president has done.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have sought for witnesses that have direct firsthand knowledge. These witnesses have relevant knowledge. Hunter Biden has none.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: And Hunter is not the only Biden family member accused of profiting off the family name.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hunter is the tip of the iceberg. We kind of called him the Biden Five, kind of like the Jackson Five. Although, in this case its corruption. There is five Biden family members that got very, very good deals, while Joe Biden was Vice President of the United States.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: Wow. All right, so that's Peter Schweizer. He's got the new book out. And Dana, he really goes into all of the Biden family members. James, to Hunter, to Frank, and these guys with no experience in any of the industries that they are getting paid for are lining up massive multimillion dollar contracts in Costa Rica and Kazakhstan and Iraq. And it does look like this is something that really is going to hurt Biden going forward the more and more this is being exposed.  PERINO: It could. Although, I think -- the questions about all of this, except for not in the detail that Peter Schweizer has put out. But questions of all that have been out there since this all began. And it hasn't hurt Joe Biden nationally in the polls --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: Well, Sanders just leapfrogged him.  PERINO: We'll see. I think that most -- and maybe Bernie Sanders will be able to win the nomination. But I think when he gets to South Carolina that will be tough. But this is kind of the way of the world, right? Famous people, especially in -- whether it is sports or entertainment or politics, your family or your friends become these people who think that you might be able to help them get a job or get some sort of a contract. In this case, Biden doesn't even have to do anything to help them. He just is the vice president, so people will flock to, like his brother. I think they did charter schools down in Florida. And I don't know how those results turned out. But what's very interesting and I think is a little puzzling is last night the Biden team put out an ad in which they're trying to explain Joe Biden's role in all the Ukraine stuff. And up to then, he hadn't really had to talk about it at all. And you have his three biggest competitors, Warren, Sanders, and Klobuchar locked away in the Senate. He's got Iowa all to himself. You could talk about all the things that Iowans care about, and instead they put out an ad about Ukraine.  WATTERS: That's a great point.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: Not the right message you want to be putting out right now.  WILLIAMS: I was listening on this point earlier. But, you know, my contrary thought that is everybody's been saying why doesn't Joe Biden get ahead of the stuff? Why doesn't he just make a clear statement? Now, he has made clear statements, but the difference here is this is an ad in the midst of a political campaign. The second thing to say is, of course, he's benefiting from the fact that Bernie Sanders, and I don't think that Bernie Sanders is ahead of Joe Biden nationally, but --  WATTERS: Just in that one poll that came out today.  WILLIAMS: But Sanders, Warren, Klobuchar, even if you consider Bennet still in the race, they're all in D.C. so Biden does benefit from that, if you will. But as far as the Hunter Biden stuff, I just -- I can't believe that you guys would sit here and say, oh, yes, he is material to the, you know, to the idea of impeaching President Trump. He's not --  WATTERS: Well, Dagen, what I would say to that is if you're going to put up a strong defense, you get to call whoever you want. And one of the reasons you call Hunter is to ask him what the hell he was doing over there and why he was doing it because that's why he was making that phone call partially.  MCDOWELL: And the Wall Street Journal wrote -- I mentioned this in an editorial that if you're arguing there was a corrupt motive that Trump have then -- and if he was investigating Hunter Biden's activities, well, let's explore that. And let's explore what Hunter Biden told his father, the Vice President about his business in Ukraine. Let's ask Obama energy star Amos Hochstein who raised concerns about Joe Biden and his aides about hunter Biden's Ukrainian ties. And then there was Chris Hines, former Secretary of State John Kerry's steps son broke business with Hunter Biden because of his work with Burisma. He called it unacceptable. So let's cover all that just really quickly. But people on the left and Democrats know that President -- that Vice President Biden has a very soft spot about his kid.  WATTERS: That's true.  MCDOWELL: That's why they stay away from it. Anytime he talks about Beau who he lost to brain cancer, he lost his first wife and daughter in a car accident. They really -- they really stay away from anything to do with his family, and he uses that to his benefit.  WATTERS: Greg, do you think the Democrats are guilty of a cover-up by preventing Hunter Biden from testifying?  GUTFELD: I think it goes straight to the top, Jesse. Straight to the top. Now I figured out what those backsplashes for. Every time you go after Trump, there's always blowback, right? It's like when you hit a tetherball, and it comes down and hits you in the back of the head. They're trying to go after Trump and what happens? It pulls Hunter Biden into this. Do you think he was ever thinking he'd be involved in this? I mean, no. And think of all the strip clubs that are now suffering because he's not spending money there. It's unfair. Look, this is -- Hunter is the hood ornament of D.C. cronyism, OK. He's a kid that skates by on daddy's name. He makes a lot of mistakes. He impregnates a lot of women, enjoy some interesting recreational substances. In this case, Trump's personal and national interests overlap. Do you want to compromise candidate becoming president? So that's what -- that's where the -- Hunter Biden go to that question. Do you want to compromise candidate becoming president, and that's Joe Biden? It's a fair question. It may help Trump personally but it also is in the national interest which is what helps Trump personally is if he's a great president. So you kind of screwed on that one too.  WILLIAMS: Yes, you know what I say? Let's bring in -- bring in Trump's children. Let's talk about nepotism --  GUTFELD: I don't think -- I don't think there's --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: I think Trump Jr. testified for 30 hours.  MCDOWELL: Hunter Biden is ready for his close up because he got new teeth. Did you notice that?  WILLIAMS: No.  GUTFELD: All right. He looks great.  WATTERS: Media siding with the Democrats over impeachment. Big surprise, that's next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: I did not pick that song. OK. It's day two of the impeachment trial even though it feels like 70. Democrats are making their case against President Trump on the Senate floor. And of course, they're getting help from the establishment media.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Adam Schiff, I think it'll go down as one of the great performances.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The President's defense team is trying to make this about anything other than the actual charges against him.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I thought could Democratic very smart today.  JOE SCARBOROUGH, HOST, MSNBC: The right-wing that's created this bubble, they have no idea what's coming in November.'  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Like when Trump won in 2016. All right, enough at him. Here's CNN's chief legal analyst gushing over Adam Schiff.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  WOLF BLITZER, HOST, CNN: What did you think of the presentation by the lead house manager Adam Schiff.  JEFFREY TOOBIN, CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST, CNN: I thought it was dazzling. I thought the way he wove through both the facts of the case and the historical context was really remarkable. It was the second-best courtroom address, since it's like a courtroom, that I ever heard.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Dazzling, dazzling. It was like he went to see a Bob Fosse musical.  PERINO: I mean, I think effect -- you might say like, maybe like the best they could name him is effective.  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: But I don't know -- I don't mean effective because I don't think that they're trying to persuade anybody who hasn't already decided. While Schiff was talking, Pew came out with his most recent poll, it's the same thing. Half of U.S. adults 51 percent say outcome on trial should be in his -- for his removal. The other half say should remain. Nothing has changed. And they broke it down GOP and Democrat, 86 percent remain in office from the Republicans, 85 percent removal from the Democrats. So it's not changing minds.  GUTFELD: Almost -- IT'S a mirror image, Jesse. You know a lot about mirrors.  WATTERS: Yes. How do I look today, Greg?  GUTFELD: You look fantastic. You can see yourself in my eyes.  WATTERS: It's not all I can say, Greg. This is like when critics give these terrible movies that appear at Sundance overseas, these great reviews.  GUTFELD: Peter Travers.  WATTERS: Yes, the minute it goes into the box office of the United States, it's just bombs. And you know, the public hates it, but these critics, these really smart critics, they think it's the best film they've ever seen. I don't -- I don't see how you can see Adam Schiff and think this guy is like it's presenting one of the greatest courtroom testimonies. It's like -- the guys like Lincoln Douglas debate caliber. The guy is a boring milk toast politician that read his notes the entire time. I mean, fine. I'll give you that. Maybe some people on Fox said he was terrible, like me, and then some people on CNN say he was the second coming of Jesus Christ. The American people said, you know what, I'm turning it off.  GUTFELD: It's still --  WATTERS: They both stink.  GUTFELD: Juan, don't you think the media just needs to play it up because they want that narrative, they want this to be seen as wonderful, they're brainwashing the viewing public?  WILLIAMS: Oh, I don't think so. I really did think he was dazzling. And I - -  WATTERS: Dazzling, Juan?  GUTFELD: You would never use the word dazzling.  WILLIAMS: No, I said masterful in the earlier segment.  GUTFELD: Masterful? Come on.  WILLIAMS: But again --  PERINO: Commanding.  WATTERS: He didn't change one Republican vote. How masterful is that?  WILLIAMS: I don't know. I don't know and you don't know at this point, but I -- but given the partisan atmosphere, Jesse, OK, let's say everybody just stays locked in. But I'm just telling you right now, the big argument to my mind and the argument that he spoke to, is this a fair trial, are Republicans playing fair in terms of witnesses and material? And I think that he did move the dial on that point. I think right now, what you're seeing is Republicans on the defensive about trying to make sure especially --  WATTERS: Oh, defensive.  WILLIAMS: Hang on. Especially in terms of protecting --  GUTFELD: They really are the defense.  WILLIAMS: -- the moderate Republicans going into the 2020 election. They're trying to say yes, if you Democrats are going to say this was -- yes, Trump got acquitted but it wasn't a fair trial. They want a defense. That's why Rob Portman, that's why Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski --  WATTERS: It's more fair than it was in the House. Everybody knows that.  GUTFELD: Dagen?  MCDOWELL: They have worn their thumbprints off googling synonyms for awesome, that's why you come up with garbage like dazzling because they're thick and unoriginal. And the same thing goes with what they're trying to do for all the Republicans. They're trying to shame them and portray them as sycophant. So they've been busy looking for synonyms. You'll see (INAUDIBLE), or bootlicker, toe sucker. You watch. They've come up with every word to describe somebody who serve out to President Trump because they're trying to nail him in November.  GUTFELD: My point on the media is that they win again because it saves them from self-reflection. They were able to escape past their embarrassing coverage of the V.A. gun rally in which they anticipated violence from 22,000 armed people in which it was like the most peaceful thing ever. But we never get -- we never get to hold them over the fire.  PERINO: And they cleaned up after themselves.  GUTFELD: They cleaned up. But we can't do that because --  PERINO: Can I say one thing about being on defense, because they are -- obviously, the President is going to present his defense through his legal team, but there are 11 ads running right now about impeachment where they're putting political pressure. All of them are from GOP aligned group. So why they're on -- like literally on the defense in the trial? They're on offense in communications and I think that will help them.  GUTFELD: All right. Up next, more on impeachment and some 2020 news. Tulsi Gabbard suing Hillary Clinton.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WILLIAMS: Fox News continuing to monitor the Senate Impeachment Trial. If anything breaks there, we'll take you to it. House managers are making the case against President Trump. In the meantime, there's some big 2020 news to tell you about. Hillary Clinton getting involved in the 2020 race. She caught major flack after blasting Bernie Sanders in a new documentary. In that piece, Clinton said that nobody likes Bernie Sanders and hinted that she wouldn't endorse him if he won the party's nomination. Now, Clinton has since walk back those comments. She says she'll support whoever the nominee is. And then there's this. Remember when Hillary Clinton called Tulsi Gabbard a ""Russian asset?"" Well, Gabbard is now suing Clinton for $50 million over that comment. Dagen, do you think he has a chance?  MCDOWELL: To win, probably not, but again, she's looking for relevancy in trying to keep her name in the news, Tulsi Gabbard is. And if you're making -- sticking your claim on Hillary Clinton, that's a little desperate. But I still think after that debate, we've got the four -- I think it's a four- part docu-series on Hillary Clinton that's coming out in March after Super Tuesday. I still think in the back of her head, she thinks that she's just going to parachute into this whole mess.  WILLIAMS: Well, I think Tulsi would have to prove malice and actual damages, right Greg?  GUTFELD: I don't know. I'm not a lawyer.  WILLIAMS: OK.  GUTFELD: But I will say that I think she's awesome. I love that first line that gets in the lawsuit -- I'll paraphrase -- when she said I'm currently running for the office of the president of the United States, something Hillary wanted, but failed to get. It's something like that. It was very funny. Hillary's giving Sanders the Trump treatment. And I think the left not might be understanding Trump a little more. She says he is -- he's mean, he has no friends, he's sexist, his supporters are bad, blah, blah. So she's - - I mean, she's joining the media in taking Bernie out. So there's definitely a force going on between like CNN's debate, Hillary, they're all doing something and I think it has something to do with Hillary trying to exert some power. I don't know what just going to drop in during the brokered convention or what.  WILLIAMS: What do you think? The reason I went to Greg was because I know he's a fan of Tulsi Gabbard. But I want to know what you think.  WATTERS: I mean, this is the month that the Democratic Party fell apart. If you think about what happened on the stage where Warren called Bernie a sexist liar, and then Hillary parachutes in and says, Bernie's a big loser with no friends, and cost her the 2016 race. And then everyone's going after Biden and Biden is going after Sanders now. It's a beautiful thing to behold. So if this was an impeachment week, this would be the biggest story out there. You have, you know, the former nominee going after potential future nominee in very personal nasty ways. And she had to walk back the fact that she wouldn't endorse Bernie, if he was the nominee. There is so much bad blood right beneath the surface in the Democratic field that the media is doing whatever they can to not report it and suppress it but this is going to come out even bigger once this trial in the Senate is finished.  WILLIAMS: Dana, I think you've been one who said right from the start, as we get closer to Iowa, you got to draw distinctions, the knives will come out. Well, isn't that what's happening?  PERINO: Yes. It's playing -- it's playing for all the marbles at this point. And -- but I thought Hillary had one good line where they -- she says, I thought people wanted my authentic, unvarnished news. And now --  WATTERS: That's good.  GUTFELD: That was a good line?  PERINO: Yes.  GUTFELD: Now, whenever she tries to be funny, it's painful.  PERINO: No, no, I thought that's a pretty good line. And I do think the left has a problem. The party has a problem. They have a big Bernie problem. They didn't deal with it in 2016. They didn't think he was going to run again. They didn't think he was going to survive after he had his heart attack. He actually got stronger out of that both looks like from a health perspective and also through his endorsements. He's got the youth behind him. And it might not take him all the way but I'll be on Tucker Carlson later tonight, talking about this because I'm going to plug myself now. But we're going to talk about it because Tucker for a while has been warning the Trump folks. Like you better take him seriously.  WILLIAMS: Yes, but the Trump -- but the Trump people, by the way, think that Bernie is the most easily defeated candidate among the Democrats.  PERINO: I think that probably is true.  WATTERS: Can -- do you suspect that we will see AOC now leap to Bernie's defense and start attacking? I think she's going to go for Crooked's throat in the next couple days.  MCDOWELL: But Hillary, this isn't happening in a vacuum. Remember the whole Howard Stern interview? This is the real Hillary. If she starts throwing Bill under the train, then you know, she's in this.  WILLIAMS: Wow.  MCDOWELL: You know, it's like --  WATTERS: Maybe she knows if you took those --  PERINO: I bet you another one of my month's salaries. I've already bet Tucker. I'll bet another month. Clinton is not getting in it, Michelle Obama's not getting in it. They're going to the candidates -- they're going to dance with the candidate they have.  WATTERS: Wait, Tucker put his month's salary on the line for that bet?  PERINO: Yes, for Michelle Obama.  GUTFELD: $20 million?  PERINO: To charity. I'm kind of winning.  WILLIAMS: Was that her name, charity? More on the impeachment trial coming up next on THE FIVE.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PERINO: All right, welcome back. You're looking live at the Senate floor. The House impeachment managers are still delivering their opening arguments in President Trump's impeachment trial. They have 24 hours to do so, but -- over three days. It's time now, for our final thoughts. We don't have ""ONE MORE THING because we don't have enough time. We have final thoughts on this very serious day. Dagen, I go to you first for your final thought.  MCDOWELL: The defense will really step up. I think Jay Sekulow, in particular, has what we see down south called good litigator hair, and it is all about the hair, good attorney hair. I'll read this. That impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there's something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path. It's still underwater. That's -- Nancy Pelosi said that last year. It's still underwater in the RealClear Politics average, because this is where the Democrats are, and it's a loser for them.  PERINO: All right, Juan, do you have a final thought or two?  WILLIAMS: Well, I just think that, you know, I was -- as I said, I was impressed by Adam Schiff today, but I think one of the things that really stood out to me was his argument that if you allow this president on a partisan basis to get away with something where the facts are not in dispute, then essentially you're saying we can have a king in this country, that you can act in self-interest, not in the national interest, and just do it with impunity. He even said that going into the 2020 election, Dana, that you can't trust Trump because he was trying to cheat with Ukraine and he was even asking China now to get involved and get information on his opponents. And to me this is like very upsetting because it's almost like a patriot saying, hey, what were the Founding Fathers designed the constitution to deal with this.  WATTERS: Yes, Democrats are real constitutionalists now, Juan.  PERINO: Is that your final thought?  WATTERS: No, I have a few more. Zion Williamson makes his debut tonight. That's what everybody really cares about at 9:00 p.m. Eastern. Everything you hear from the media is exactly the opposite of what they say. They say the Republicans are engaged in a cover-up yet they don't want the whistleblower or Hunter to testify. They won't even let you into the skiff to see the testimony by the I.G., who's also very suspicious. RealClearInvestigation says a great piece here is some new exclusive reporting about how the whistleblower was overheard talking to the guy Schiff hired from the National Security Council in 2017 about the need to take Trump out and to get him impeach. So this goes all the way back. And again, they said Avenatti was the greatest thing since sliced bread and now he's rotting behind bars in El Chapo's old cell block.  PERINO: I read that. I read -- I read this RealClearInvestigation piece too. Well, I read a lot today. And Greg, you have a final thought?  GUTFELD: I have a couple. While this was going on, President Trump signed an agreement to plant one trillion trees, whereas CNN will say he's guilty of treason. This spectacle exists independent of reality because we know how it ends, right? We know how these ends. This is all meaningless, it's boring, it bores and moronic. Abuse of power is not impeachable because it's an opinion. Just because you don't like the way somebody does his job, you can call it an abuse of power, so it can be done -- it can be done on anybody. Meanwhile, the media is banking on the impact of their generic coverage, just having impeachment trial in their lower third is enough to make you think, oh, maybe this guy's guilty. That's what they're hoping for.  PERINO: So my final thought is that the Democrats who think that these so- called moderate, even though they are conservative people, moderate Republicans are going to save them in this impeachment trial. I don't think it will happen. I'm going to go on record now. I'll predict that Susan Collins of Maine will win reelection, Mitch McConnell will definitely have her back. And she will be considered one of the heroes of 2020. That's my thought.  GUTFELD: I'm a hero.  PERINO: Set your DVRs as you are here. Never miss an episode of THE FIVE. ""SPECIAL REPORT"" is up next.  GUTFELD: I'm a hero.  Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2020 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

99,FOX,"Democrats and Republicans gear up for partisan battle; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" January 20, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I am Dana Perino, along Emily Compagno, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It is 5 o'clock in New York City. This is ""The Five."" The countdown to impeachment is on. President Trump's legal team launching a blistering attack against Democrats as the Senate trial is set to ramp up tomorrow. The president's lawyers calling the case, quote, ""flimsy and a dangerous perversion of the Constitution."" It comes as both sides prepare for a partisan battle. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER: We will force votes on witnesses and documents, and it will be up to four Republicans to side with the Constitution. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When it comes to Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi may pray for him privately, but she has orchestrated the church of holy hell. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Any Republican senator who says there should be no witnesses or even that witnesses should be negotiated is part of a cover- up. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: On their face, the articles of impeachment, they don't allege high crimes and misdemeanors. They fail on their face. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: History has its eyes on us. How are we going to operate? (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: Speaker Nancy Pelosi drawing more criticisms after saying impeachment was a sombre moment for America. Here she is on Bill Maher's show. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you so much for waiting till we get back on the air before you started the impeachment. (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There are some people who actually have said that he wanted to be impeached. Just for the record, being impeached is a bad thing, right? NANCY PELOSI, HOUSE SPEAKER: And you are impeached forever. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: And Congresswoman Maxine Waters saying no matter what happens with impeachment, Democrats will continue investigating the president. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Subpoenas that I have issued that's going through the lower courts are now going to be heard at the Supreme Court in March. We will not stop. Whether or not that leads to another impeachment activity, I don't know. But I know we must continue with the work that our constituents have elected us to come to Congress to do. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: And actually, Jesse, one of Speaker Pelosi's lawyers did say that a third article of impeachment is not out of the question, though he left it undefined. JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST: Really? OK. Yeah, I have heard that before. Go for it, Libs. So Democrats want some new witnesses in the Senate trial. Oh, do they? OK, well, they could have just sued and gone to court and had a judge compel testimony, and they wouldn't have to sit back and complain. But now they are complaining anyway. So now they only want witnesses for the prosecution. They don't want the defense to have any witnesses. That's how fair they are being. So Nadler says he's not going to negotiate witnesses at all. So you have a Republican saying, all right, Nadler. We'll give you Bolton. We'll give you Pence. We'll give you whoever you want. Just give us Hunter. And, you know what? Nadler says that's off the table. So think about how far they are willing to go to protect Hunter Biden. Why does Hunter Biden need so much protection? It's because this whole situation that he's involved in is a complete disaster. They are saying he's not a relevant witness? Well, the Supreme Court has granted wide latitude for defense counsel to call whoever they want. To set out whatever fact case they can, to set up a strong and robust defense to protect their Constitutional rights. It doesn't matter what Nadler says is relevant or not. It's whether the Supreme Court says it is, and it is. So Hunter Biden is a material witness to the defense. The Ukrainians have said publicly the only reason Hunter was given this plum gig is to protect Burisma from prosecution. And he was successful. So the guy just got kicked out of the Navy for drugs and now he gets some plum position overseas that he has no knowledge of. It's absolutely crazy. It's not an abuse of power to investigate corruption, especially when it involves a corrupt country who colluded against you when millions of dollars were on the line. Could you imagine if Trump Jr. got appointed to some plum gig in a Chinese company? And the Democrats said you know what, let's look into it, and Trump said no, no. I am running for president. I am untouchable. PERINO: Yeah. (CROSSTALK) PERINO: Is it sustainable for the Democrats to say no to -- if they want witnesses on their side for them not to allow Republicans to call who they want? JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Yeah, it is sustainable. I mean, remember sustainable again suggests that this is a court of law. This is not a court of law. It's an impeachment hearing. And the key here, it seems to me, is the court of public opinion. And the court of public opinion is pretty clear. You even have large numbers of Republicans who say yes. Witnesses should be called. Bolton should be called. He has direct knowledge of the specific crime and charges against the president. Hunter Biden has no such knowledge. Joe Biden has no such knowledge. They weren't privy to the phone call. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: I'm going to finish. The president had with the president of the Ukraine, in which he was, and has now been found to have committed a crime by the GAO to withhold $400 million in exchange for insisting that an announcement be made, by the president of the Ukraine of an investigation into the Biden's. This has nothing to do with Hunter Biden. WATTERS: So you are going to deny the president due process in the House and in the Senate? WILLIAMS: He was not denied due process. WATTERS: Sure, he was. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: What's interesting to me is you have the White House briefs come out today. And in the White House briefs, a very good lawyer, Pat Cipollone, highly regarded. But Pat and Jay Sekulow make no effort really to defend the president. It's like comic book stuff. It's like the president's Twitter feed. This is ridiculous. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: It is 127 pages. That's an effort. (CROSSTALK) PERINO: Let's get Greg's take on it, because there's so much to talk about. Of course, you got lots of note. I did wonder what you thought about the Bill Maher-Nancy Pelosi -- GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Well, you know, I mean, obviously -- again, when you say impeachment is forever, that it's telling you that this is an emotional victory for her. It's personal. It's not even political. This is about we're going to get the guy back. And it's all about personal. They're going to lose. They're going to lose, but they still have that to keep them warm at night. Nadler, I don't understand. He can't say what's off the table. He's not in charge. You can just tell him to shut up. You can't -- the prosecutors can't tell the defense who they can't call. So that's -- but I want to go to a bigger message here, Dana. PERINO: OK. GUTFELD: All right. The problem with the news is that we are an easy mark, right? We believe in the definition of objectivity. It's turning the camera on and showing what's happening. The problem is there's no defense against being exploited. So what the Dems -- they're very smart. You can get objective news by creating this spectacle. And everybody has to put the camera on and pre-empt shows like THE FIVE because we got to show it, because it's big news. So when we are pre-empted by something called the news, remember it is only news because they are telling you it is news. The pomp and circumstance, the slow walk, the dramatic pauses, the language, it's all fakery. It's artifice to make you feel like it is news when it's not. So I have a suggestion to the reader, I mean the viewer at home who feels hopeless, all right? You can call your senator and you can tell them to get this crap over with as soon as possible because you want to watch ""The Five."" I want you to get a pen. Get a pen right now, 202-224-3121. That is the main operator for the Senate and they will connect you to the specific Senate office that is your senator, and you can tell them get this thing over with because you're not going to miss an episode of ""The Five."" It's just not fair. And feel free to call Fox News and let them know that we should all get raises, especially me. PERINO: The thing about the witnesses, Emily, is that we are talking about this now, but there's phase one that has to happen, which is setting the rules of the road. Each side gets 24 hours to make their case. And it's only after that that then they will go to the issue of specific witnesses if there were to be any. So I think it is possible that after 24 -- 48 hours and you don't have to use the whole 24 hours per side. That at that point, maybe they will decide that they've heard enough. Is that being too hopeful that this gets over with quickly? EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: It's probably being hopeful. But you're right that the senators take a vote after they have heard both sides present their entire story. Whether they feel that a witness' testimony is required to resolve the articles of impeachment. And I have to take issue with one thing that you said. This isn't an impeachment hearing. This is an actual trial. And it's not a criminal court of law trial that we are used to maybe when we watch TV. But this is an actual trial and it can lead to a conviction in the Senate. And I think it's important to highlight just for viewers, too, because we're beginning tomorrow on what the arguments are the president's team is arguing. They are arguing both procedural and substantive. They are saying that there was no crime alleged, and that the Constitution in its plain language meaning without everyone extrapolating, just what it says, plain and fair. It needs to be a crime alleged, and also that it has to be a high crime. And it's not -- you have to have both together. And then they are also -- that was by the way successful in prior impeachment testimony. And I know I'm not necessarily saying anything mind-blowing that people don't already know. But I think it's important to package this in a way that viewers understand going into tomorrow, because there is about be a lot of hours of drivel where everyone is captivated by news covering this, because it's important. They need to understand what they're talking about. And also, that there will be a defense substantively saying, and regardless, this is not an abuse of Congress and this is not impeachment worthy. WATTERS: So you are saying call your senator also. COMPAGNO: Yes. One quick last point, it's not these impeachment managers, and it's not the senators, and it's the House whose right it is to a fair trial. It is the president's. It is the defendant's right to a fair trial. PERINO: And then you mentioned that this could lead to a guilty verdict but it could also it could lead to an acquittal, which is what happened for others, and that's important for history as well. All right, coming up, actor John Cusack blasting capitalism during a rally for Bernie Sanders, and Robert De Niro, yup, he's got another anti-Trump rant. That's next on THE FIVE. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WATTERS: Welcome back. We got some brand new examples of left-wing hysteria we want to tell you about, actor John Cusack hitting the campaign trail for Bernie this weekend in New Hampshire, and dropping this apocalyptic warning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Bernie respects us enough to tell the truth, the hard truth. We have a 10 to 12 year window to radically transform our energy systems, our climate change, predatory capitalism, and the endless war economies will rob us to the right of any future at all. As we can see literally everyday, the house is on fire. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: And here's former top Clinton advisor, James Carville trashing the president. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trump and Trump-ism is the greatest threat this country has faced since the fall of communism. And the only way to deal with it is defeat it soundly (ph). If Michael Bennet is the Democratic nominee, you're going to get 55 percent of the popular vote and you take up 55 Senate seats. And it will be the end of Trump-ism. And Trump-ism doesn't have to just be defeated at the polls. He has got to be decimated. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: All right. Juan, who makes less sense, Carville or John Cusack? WILLIAMS: What did they say that was nonsense? WATTERS: They compared Trump to the fall of communism and said we only have 10 years left to destroy capitalism. WILLIAMS: No, no, no. WATTERS: Did I read that wrong? WILLIAMS: I think you did. I think that what Carville saying is he sees Trump-ism as the biggest threat this country has faced since the fall of communism. I guess that's in the 80s, the Berlin Wall and the like, right? I could see where this has been the major political phenomena. I think it's decimated the Republican Party whenever a major political party -- GUTFELD: Stronger than ever. WILLIAMS: It's now the party of Trump. It's like a cult. So I mean, that's -- GUTFELD: That is so insulting. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: Trump-ism has been pretty good for America. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: No, it's not. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: You know you guys say that and it's just so -- (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: -- if people talked about Obama's followers being in a cult because they are people who did that, which was equally as wrong. And Carville is saying Trump is worse since the fall of communism. So that includes ISIS, Al Qaeda, AIDS, climate change. So in three years, you have record low unemployment. You've got a prosperous economy. Trump is killing Americans with good news. WILLIAMS: No, he's not. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: No, no, no. WILLIAMS: No, no, no. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: You've been wrong, Juan, on every point. WILLIAMS: Here's a country that's being divided that is now politically -- people say I can't go to dinner with my family. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: That's emotional. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: You have emotional problems. Those are emotional problems, Juan. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: Republicans are -- (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: Let's move it around. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: I want to point because he mocked me there. All of his opinions about Trump are about future threats. They don't discuss the present. You can't discuss unemployment, the economy. You can't talk about the stock market. You have to talk about the future threat because that's conveniently un-measurable. You can't measure it, Juan. Oh, my dinners are ruined. WILLIAMS: If I wanted to talk about income inequality, if I wanted to talk about -- erratic, provocative action that brought us to the brink of World War III -- (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: Let's move it along. Let's play actor Robert De Niro, again, going after President Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There is right and there's wrong, and there's common sense and there's abuse of power. And there is a cynicism. I have as much right as anybody -- an actor, an athlete, a musician, anybody else, to voice my opinion. And if I have a bigger voice because of my situation, I'm going to use it whenever I see a blatant abuse of power. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: He sounded a little defensive to me, Dana. I have every right to speak -- PERINO: Because the last time he got the big brush back pitch from everybody after the F-word rant. That was one of many. So I have been thinking about this a little bit, although we've talked about it. Maybe it's just finally solidified in my mind. So when President Trump brought pop culture into alignment with politics, now all of a sudden for the first time in quite a long time. You actually have conservative principles being discussed on more -- on a mass communication scale. So now you actually have people talking about all the things that Greg was talking about that you can measure and all those things, whether they work or not. But you actually -- this is no longer just the back pages of National Review. This is now -- everybody's talking about it at dinner, on social media, etcetera. The Democrats have always had culture and liberals have had culture. But they -- now are not able to marry that to politics. So I think that's why there is a split. They can't get a foothold where President Trump was able to bring those worlds together. Yeah, he saw an opportunity. And I don't think somebody who didn't have the presence that he did on -- in the media would've been able to actually do that. And I don't know of anybody running for president on the Democratic side actually can do that either. WATTERS: I haven't certainly seen it in any of the debates, anybody with any swagger. COMPAGNO: No. That's -- swagger is definitely lacking from the left. I think, too, part of the issue that is so difficult for people to swallow is that this is the exact type of fear-mongering that these guys are arguing that Trump brought to the table and that that's what's dividing the country, so none of this is relatable whatsoever. The comment that we have 10 years to save the planet from capitalism, how is that not fear-mongering. How is that not totally un-relatable? So it's doing that same repellent that they are arguing that Trump has done in this country. And I think part of the issue -- when you're talking about the future fear is that that's why none of this is actionable. GUTFELD: Right. COMPAGNO: No one has their feet still on the ground that we have showcased here where they can articulate an issue and say so, look, this is how you solve it. Or look, here is the demonstrable problem with this data, and this is what I'm offering, instead, it saying that we are all going to explode in 10 years because of this really horrible source of, again, this kind of polarizing dramatic end of the world. WATTERS: And by the way, John Cusack, amazing performance in Runaway Jury. If you don't want to watch the impeachment trial, just check that out on Netflix. All right, the New York Times mocked over who they are endorsing for the Democratic nomination. Greg's mono is next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GUTFELD: In 1964, the New York Times endorsed a Democrat for president. In 1968, also a Dem, 72, a Dem, 76, 80, 84, 88, Dem, Dem, Dem, 92, 96, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, Dem, Dem, Dem, Dem, Dem, Dem, Dem, Dem. So what a shock that today The Times made a bold move. They endorsed a Democrat. Sorry, make that two Democrats. Yes, in case one gets a flat, we have got a spare. That's The Time's definition of breaking with convention, doubling down on the same old, same old. But that's how the media gatekeepers see the world that the only choices available to you come from a wide range of leftists. So do you go left, really left, or really, really left? You never go right because that would be evil. Here, they picked a traditional liberal and a leftist who makes Che Guevara look like Barry Goldwater. But it's really about Bernie. This endorsement is another example of the media elbowing Sanders out of the way. This after CNN's hit job on him at the debate, and then there's Joy Reid, damning Bernie with a body language expert. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think Bernie is lying. We see him. He is slouches forward anyway, Joy, but here he turtles. If you look at his eye level where he normally answers questions, when he makes the denial, his who shoulders come up like a little kid getting caught. His eye level is below his shoulders. This is trying to hide in plain sight. He has numerous hotspots he says well. Liars like to start with well. He looks away. He laughs. If he said it, which I believe that he did, he would've been better to just own it. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Powerful stuff. Joy hiring a lie detector, that's like Charlie Sheen hiring a drug-sniffing dog. Remember those anti-gay posts that she claimed were the product of a hack. It's clear what the established media is doing, deciding who they want and don't want. They're making sure everyone falls in line. They look at the country and instead of sing a strong prosperous economy, they see themselves out of power. And they want their power back even if it means killing that prosperity. The good news is now you see the media's distaste for you right out there in the open. But please don't return the favor and call them a hack. That would be mean. WATTERS: That was a good monologue. GUTFELD: Why, thank you. WATTERS: Pretty good. GUTFELD: Well, I'll just go to you first then, Jesse. WATTERS: I never knew that was how to get you to go to me first. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: Does this make sense to pick two opposites on the liberal spectrum. WATTERS: Well, Greg, you know, I don't care who the New York Times endorses. I care who the New York Post endorses. Only then will I know who I'm going to be supporting in 2020. Now, I don't think these endorsements mean anything. I think maybe back in the day. Union endorsements did when, like, the mob or the union boss. When the union boss told the workers who to vote for, but even then, I think now this is more like inside baseball. It's like the bachelor. And you're at the final rose ceremony and he gives two roses to two women. It's bittersweet. And you have to be thinking, OK, I will let the guy put a ring on my finger but it just doesn't feel right. And now, especially because it's a second-tier candidate lumped in with the first. Liz Warren has got to be thinking really? It doesn't feel good. Now, the way they kind of screwed over Bernie Sanders, I think was really wrong. They said Bernie's moment has passed. GUTFELD: And he had a heart attack. They brought that up. WATTERS: But they give Amy the endorsement. Amy's never had a moment or a movement. So what are they thinking there, which brings me to a personal story I need to share, coming home last night. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: -- elevator into my building, about to close, arm goes through, three Bernie Sanders supporters come into my elevator. They all have the Bernie 2020 T-shirts. They just been out canvassing. A woman goes to me, I know you are, and I tense up, I get nervous. Because a lot of that time it doesn't mean it's a good thing. And she goes, I don't agree with anything you believe in, anything you say, but I respect the opposition. And as a matter of fact, you guys, meaning Fox News, you guys have been fair to Bernie. And I said, well, yes, Bernie's getting screwed just like Trump did. And she goes, and you know what, when they screw him over again, we're just going to do what we did last time and vote for Trump. GUTFELD: Wow. WATTERS: Can you believe that? And then I called my real estate agent. I said, guys, I live in a Bernie Sanders building? GUTFELD: Did you have them evicted? WATTERS: Yes, I made a call. GUTFELD: Juan, what do you make? Do you think the Times messages is it's not just about Bernie, it's also about Joe? No white man, no old white man. No old white man. It's not going to work. WILLIAMS: No, actually I thought it was a silly thing to do, just basically because everybody gets one vote, right? GUTFELD: Yes. WILLIAMS: It's not like can go on the voting and say, oh, yes, I want to candidates. PERINO: It's like a great choice for me. WILLIAMS: You just get one candidate, so they should have picked one candidate. I would agree that I don't think newspaper endorsements mean as much as they used to, but they do have some meaning. I think local papers still have -- you know, Des Moines, Iowa, for example, I think the Register is going to have more impact on the caucuses than this. But I do also think that when you look at the opportunity they had to define between the far left as represented by Bernie, by the way, and the more centrist positions represented by Klobuchar, Biden, and the like, but Bernie versus Biden, essentially, and they didn't make a choice there. WATTERS: Right. WILLIAMS: So to me, they lost an opportunity because that's the big fight within the Democratic Party right now. And also, if they had simply picked Klobuchar, or simply picked Warren, it would have given added attention in terms of the media spotlight to one candidate. Now, it's kind of diffuse and as a result, it doesn't have the punch, even the limited punch that you described, Jessie, for anybody. WATTERS: Right. GUTFELD: What do you think, Emily? COMPAGNO: That newspaper endorsements, yes, they don't barely mean anything anymore. And frankly, they matter more to donors than they do to voters. And so, to that extent, this hurts Biden the most, who is the one that needs the most fundraising. And also he needs -- he's the one that needs people to believe that he's the consensus pick. I think it's a cop-out for them to have chosen to. And given the fact that I think back in the day when you just got one physical paper a day, it was a big deal to find out who they endorse, but now we know how everyone feels. There's no hiding any one of those individual journalists or the editorial board's feelings. We've been -- we're having it rammed down our throats every day all day in all forms of social media and their outlets. So I think the other thing is, it's not really a surprise in the fact that they are damaging Biden and Bernie. We've known that all along. GUTFELD: You know, I think the New York Times complimented Liz Warren as a gifted storyteller. PERINO: Oh, I wrote that right here. Look, a gifted storyteller. I thought you were going to seize on them. GUTFELD: Oh, I'm glinting you seize on it. PERINO: Because I thought that was -- GUTFELD: Seize the day. PERINO: I did think it was interesting. It's like, yes, she has told some stories. GUTFELD: Yes. PERINO: And the President, if she were the nominee, would certainly be retelling those stories on the trail. It's like Time Magazine when they put their Person of the Year. Remember they did like the protester? GUTFELD: Yes. PERINO: And then it just -- it renders it totally meaningless. I also noted one other thing that I thought was a good compliment for President Trump in this editorial, that he should -- he will run on this, which is they said that Warren had a hard time answering how she would be able to get any of this stuff done when it went up against a conservative judiciary, because it was unconstitutional. So I think that he is obviously had a huge impact that the New York Times editorial page is actually asking about those things. I also think it was about nominating the two women. I think if Kamala Harris were still in the race, they would have chosen three. GUTFELD: Yes. I think -- PERINO: I truly believe that, and Kirsten Gillibrand, although, you know, pretty insulting to Tulsi Gabbard. GUTFELD: Yes. PERINO: She's still in it. GUTFELD: But I think it's also to the fact that they just didn't give it to Liz means they probably had some reservations. PERINO: They might have. I also think the timing was interesting. The New York Times is now more about building its own brand than having their own little T.V. show. GUTFELD: That is shows hilarious, the evil doctor. PERINO: So instead of doing this on Saturday night -- GUTFELD: With the beard. PERINO: -- it would have been on the Sunday morning television shows, they waited until after 9:30 p.m. on a Sunday night with their own T.V. show. They didn't really care. GUTFELD: All right. Are we done here? PERINO: Yes. GUTFELD: I haven't heard from a producer in a while. I think this is out. Coming up, a guy tried to shame a target employee on Twitter, but it doesn't go according to plan. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WILLIAMS: Major outrage at one man's attempt at online public shaming. A self-identified journalist posted this photo of a Target store manager named Tori. The man claimed that he called the police after Tori refused to sell him an electric toothbrush worth about $80. The guy was upset because the price was mistakenly displayed as just one cent. The man claims that the law required the store to honor the price as advertised, but the store manager she refused. The public shaming, however, has backfired. A GoFundMe page was set up to help support the manager, Tori, and it has raised about $30,000. Well, let's just start with the law, Emily. I looked at this and I saw that the statute says if there's a gross misrepresentation, there's no requirement for the store to sell you it for one cent. COMPAGNO: Correct. He's totally wrong on the law. There is that exemption. It's for non-grocery items. And the gross error means that if it's worth over $20, which this was, then it would be if you posted the price less than a 20 percent -- 20 percent discount. So clearly, this falls within the exemption. And I think the larger point here is that this guy is a jerk. He is waste of skin. He is not a journalist. He is a troll. He is the worst of humanity and the worst of Twitter. Not just this, after the multiple fatality shooting in Manchester arena with Ariana Grande, he immediately tweeted, I almost died the first time I listened to her music too. And then he doubled down and he continued tweeting really disgusting jokes. And then his apology was I made a joke and I laughed and he posted some gifs. And then when Anthony Bourdain called him out and called him a gaping, steaming A-hole, after he died by suicide, this guy put on Twitter looks like -- look who's the gaping steaming A-hole now and called him selfish for dying by suicide. I don't know why Twitter hasn't taken him off the platform. I don't know why he has over 200,000 followers. He is disgusting. He needs to be taken off everything. WILLIAMS: All right, Greg. GUTFELD: I don't think I can -- I rest my case. WILLIAMS: Normally I don't go to you to calm things down, but I must say -- GUTFELD: I will not use the word gay. WILLIAMS: No, don't do that. Don't do that. GUTFELD: No, but this shows you how social media can be a minus and a plus. So you have a super creepy guy who's got a serious disorder who wants to exact some weird punishment on some girl just doing her job. Maybe he has a thing against women, I don't know. That's the minus of social media because it gives a nobody the chance to ruin somebody's life. But then you see the plus. You see this plus you see Carpe Donktum start this -- Donktum -- start this GoFundMe page to get like $5,000 her. It turns out it gets 30 grand because people on social media also recognize what's going on and they decide they're going to help fix it. So on one hand, you have -- you the worst of social media, and then on the other you have the best. You have a minus and a plus -- so -- and I think that like you know, hats off to Carpe for starting. I think she's got $30,000. PERINO: Now she -- and also she tweeted that she is working with resources to find a cause that is worthy of your generosity and something you would all be proud to donate to. So she's not even going to keep the money. WILLIAMS: Yes, I think that was pretty awesome because I think the idea was initially here's some money to go on a vacation. Get away from this. And she just said here on this -- PERINO: No, I admire her. WILLIAMS: But, Jesse, it looks like it's become highly politicized, right? WATTERS: How dare it become politicized? WILLIAMS: I don't know how it became politicized because I just think that it's obvious that what this guy did was wrong, but now it looks like mostly its Trump supporters who are involved in the effort to try to set the record straight. GUTFELD: You're complimenting the Trump supporters. WATTERS: I know -- I didn't know about the politics. I sympathize with his plight, and here's why. WILLIAMS: OK. WATTERS: I go to the dentist twice a year. GUTFELD: Oh, no. WATTERS: And every time the dentist says, So, Mr. Waters, are you using an electric toothbrush? And every time I say no, and every time I can sense him judging me like, what is world, like you can afford $150 electric toothbrush. And I'll tell you what, I'm not paying $150 for an electric toothbrush when I can spend $6.99 and do it manually. Greg might have a fancy electric toothbrush and he thinks himself a fancy lad, but I'm laughing all the way the back, baby, and smile is just as bright. WILLIAMS: Would you have bought it for one cent? WATTERS: Yes. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: Remember, he called the police. He called the police on it. WATTERS: Not the emergency line. WILLIAMS: All right, Prince Harry finally breaking his silence on the Royal fall out from Megxit. Hear about it and hear from him right here on THE FIVE next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) COMPAGNO: Welcome back. Megxit has been finalized by Buckingham Palace and here are the deeds. Harry and Meghan can no longer use their Royal Highness titles and they won't be receiving any more public money. Here's Prince Harry speaking out for the first time publicly. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRINCE HARRY, DUKE OF SUSSEX: The decision that I have made for my wife and I to step back is not what I made lightly. And I know I haven't always got it right, but as far as this goes, there really was no other option. What I want to make clear as we're not walking away, and we certainly aren't walking away from you. (END VIDEO CLIP) COMPAGNO: Dana, they no longer have HRH, but it's been argued the Queen is leaving the door open for him to return by keep -- they keep Frogmore Cottage, they keep a few other things. What are your thoughts on that? PERINO: Yes, she's keeping her options open says the Queen. She's hoping that they'll maybe return. And maybe they will. Maybe just like the first year was maybe just like too intense. I don't think that the media coverage is going to subside just because they're moving to North America, whether they're in Canada or in L.A. because I think it'll just double because the British press will still be following them and the American and Canadian press will be following them too. I think that they could probably go off and do some pretty good work. I think that they'll probably get really into the climate change thing. But other than that, he had done a lot with veterans especially wounded warriors. And I imagine that as they settle in and try to figure out what they want to do, they'll figure it out. There's no public money, but apparently, Prince Charles will take care of things for a year. COMPAGNO: Greg. GUTFELD: Yes. COMPAGNO: Do you see the Netflix Empire, Apple TV, Obama model in their future, which is just reaping book deals and documentaries on climate change? GUTFELD: I'm more interested in why this happened. Well, first of all, who gets all the sectors and the staffs and who gets the court jester, right, and the potions -- and the potions that they have -- they have potion specialist. Look, there are two reasons why I left -- and I figure this out because I lived in London. One is discomfort. If you don't grow up in England, you're not used to the cold, damp weirdness of it all. Everything is smaller and they think that old is posh. No old is old. So they go, let's go sit under a thatched roof and freeze our butts off because I go stay on a weekend like in a holiday in a thatched roof in the middle of the countryside. The food is terrible. The furniture is old and uncomfortable. You have to throw blankets on because there's always a draft. It's always cold, the toilet smell, there's always -- they have carpets in the bathroom so that soaks up all the stuff. OK, that's one reason, discomfort. The second reason is media. Prince Harry blames the media for leaving. So this is another facet of life, that media ruins. I mean, how many other facets do we need to experience that shows that every time you add media to it, it ruins it. You can't have nice things with the media. They ruined royalty. They ruin everything. I hate you, media. WATTERS: Well, I mean, they're blaming the media, but they let the media win. Trump would have just destroyed the media and stayed longer in the Royal family and made it much more royal and more obnoxious. I think they've quit the Royal family but they get to keep all the money. And for people saying that they don't like what these people did, so many Americans would want to do the same thing. COMPAGNO: Wait, what do you make of the fact that Meghan Markle's dad came out and said they're making the monarchy, a Wal-Mart with a crown. WILLIAMS: I mean, it's petty and it's kind of nasty. PERINO: Also, Wal-Mart is awesome. WILLIAMS: Because it's like family infighting going public. I think this is part of why they said, you know what, we're sick of this. We don't want to have to be exposed to this costly constant drubbing, you know, from all the paparazzi. But you know, what strikes me is that they are not taking the money after the year. You said Prince Charles is going to take care of them for a year, but they're no longer going to be on the payroll. WATTERS: Yes, but -- WILLIAMS: So they have got to find a way to monetize the fact that people like us are so interested in them and gossip about them and what are they up to, what are they doing? I think they can do it in terms of the Netflix deals, in terms of books. I think they're going to be fine. COMPAGNO: Yes. He mentioned that he was Diana's son a few times in that speech and I think he has so much obviously residual pain from that. And I think Meghan Markle was the tip in that direction. All right, ""ONE MORE THING"" is up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PERINO: It's time now for ""ONE MORE THING."" Juan? WILLIAMS: All right, so it's the 35th anniversary of the King Federal Holiday today. Dr. King would have been 91 on January 15th. This morning his son Martin Luther King Jr -- or the third, I should say, brought his wife and daughter on stage to say that his father's fight for justice is still very real. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARTIN LUTHER KING III, SON OF MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.: On this holiday. It is as Reverend said, about recommitting ourselves, rededicating ourselves to continue to work because it is nowhere near done. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: In that spirit today, there are lots of volunteer efforts around the country to help with the homeless, the hungry, schools, and others in need, especially children, so terrific. And so many have said that the King holiday is, in fact, best observed as a day on not a day off for people who care about trying to deal with racial justice and equal rights for all. Happy King Day America. PERINO: Indeed. Thank you, Juan. Jesse, you're next. WATTERS: Happy King Day. Also, significant political anniversary that we're celebrating. I don't know If you guys remember this. We're going to California, and Texas, and New York, and we're going to South Dakota, and Oregon, and Washington, and Michigan, and then we're going to Washington D.C. to take back the White House. Not the eloquence of Martin Luther King, but there he is Howard Dean, 16 years ago, the Dean scream. Remember Dean didn't win Iowa. He came in third. And then he fell apart shortly thereafter. PERINO: Memories. WILLIAMS: What does that tell you about screaming? WATTERS: Don't do it. WILLIAMS: Oh, good. GUTFELD: All right, stop the fun. Let's do this. Greg 2020 Olympic flying animal long jump. OK, everybody, here's going to judge these long jumps. First up, the squirrel. Let's see how this squirrel does. I believe it's an Australian squirrel. I don't know. But there he goes. Check him out. There you go. Look at that one. All right, let's go to something we're all familiar with, the fox jump. Look at that one. Look at that. PERINO: Nice. GUTFELD: That was an injury. And now, my favorite -- show them one more time. I think he wasn't hurt. My favorite, you got it, the sugar glider. Look at that. PERINO: You're going to get one of those, aren't you? GUTFELD: I'm going to get one of those, pizza kid. Emily, what's your favorite? COMPAGNO: The fox for sure because its mouth opened, it's so cute. GUTFELD: Juan? WILLIAMS: That's what's scary about the fox, but it was pretty. Somebody's got to get hurt, either the cameraman or the fox. GUTFELD: All right, sugar glider for the win. PERINO: I'm going to go with the fox. GUTFELD: I'm going to go with the sugar glider so the fox wins I believe. WILLIAMS: Yes. GUTFELD: Damn it. Fox always wins. Think that, CNN. PERINO: OK, so I hope you have an appetite because a plant in Texas has created the world's largest Snickers bar. Guinness Book of World Records' massive chunk of chocolate that weighs over 4,700 pounds is two feet high, 26 inches wide. It's the size of 43,000 single size snicker bars put together. The plant says they came up with the idea two weeks ago. And it took more 600 workers, a full week to complete it which is awesome. And I - - just for fun, of course -- WATTERS: Watters. WILLIAMS: But, Dana, what was the idea? I don't -- why did they do -- PERINO: Because sometimes you know like -- it's like why did you go to the moon? Because you can, you know. GUTFELD: This is definitely bigger than the moon landing. PERINO: I mean, it's like -- why do Americans do -- I also -- I have a -- go to Fox News right now, on podcasts, I have an interview with Roy Castro amazing success story after his incarceration. It's on Fox Newspodcast.com and that's the strive organization. That's all. Emily. COMPAGNO: OK, you guys, for the story of the night are Brad and Jen back. Last night was the Screen Actors Guild Awards, and what we saw was the first public reunion of Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt. And basically, this was him accepting his Best Supporting Actor Award and that's her looking longingly and maybe lovingly at him. And then that's her accepting her Best Actress Award and that's him watching her on the screen. The internet is dying, everyone is dying. Everyone was them to be together again. I'm ambivalent. PERINO: I think they are new Meghan and Harry. WATTERS: Yes. We need a body language expert like Joy Reid to figure that out. PERINO: All right. Set your DVRs, never miss an episode of ""The Five.""

100,FOX,"New York Times endorses Warren and Klobuchar for president. In 1964, the New York Times endorsed a Democrat for president. In 1968, it was also a Democrat. In 1972, it was a Democrat. In 1976, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2016, it was more Democrats. NY TIMES REPORTER'S TWEET OF SOLEIMANI RECITING POETRY DRAWS BACKLASH So, what a shock it was when the Times made a bold move in 2020: endorsing a Democrat! Sorry, make that two Democrats. Yes, in case one gets a flat, we've got a spare! That's the Times’ definition of “breaking with convention.” Doubling down on the same old, same old. That’s how the media gatekeepers see the world. The only choices available to you come from a wide range... of leftists. Do you go left, really left, or really, really left? In any case, you never go right. That'd be evil. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Here, they picked a traditional liberal and a leftist who makes Che Guevara look like Barry Goldwater. Really, this is about Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. The endorsement is another example of the media elbowing Sanders out of the way. This, after CNN’s hit job on him at the debate. There was also Joy Reid damning Bernie with a body-language expert on her program. Joy Reid hiring a lie detector is like Charlie Sheen hiring a drug-sniffing dog. Remember those anti-gay posts that she claimed were the product of a hack? It’s clear what the establishment media are doing: deciding who they want, who they don't want, and then making everyone fall in line. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP They look at the country, and instead of seeing a strong, prosperous economy, they see themselves out of power. And, they want their power back, even if it means killing that prosperity. The good news is that you now see the media's distaste for you out in the open. But ,please don’t return the favor and call them “hacks.” That's just mean. Adapted from Greg Gutfeld’s monologue on “The Five” on Jan. 20, 2020. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY GREG GUTFELD"
101,FOX,"The New York Times reports prosecutors are scrutinizing at least two news articles about the FBI and James Comey from 2017; reaction on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" January 17, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: And one of the key players in that trade deal with China and how he sees things sorting out, Peter Navarro.  All coming up at 10 a.m. Eastern right here on Fox News. Here's ""The Five.""  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello. I'm Jesse Watters along with Kennedy, Juan Williams, Dana Perino and Greg. It's five o'clock in New York City and this is The Five.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You take pictures behind the Resolute desk. It's been there a long time. A lot of presidents, some good, some not so good. But you got a good one now even though they're trying to impeach the son of a b****. Can you believe that?  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: President Trump joking in confident about impeachment while Democrats and the media attempt to Hail Mary. They've been pumping up their new star witness Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas. The guy has some serious credibility issues, but Democrats and the media are more than happy to overlook all of that. Take a look at some of the reaction.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER: Last night Lev Parnas gave an astonishing interview on national television.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The revelations he talked really are blockbusters.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: More on the bomb shell.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: For this explosive material.  JOHN BERMAN, HOST, CNN: It's explosive new interview.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Absolutely explosive interview.  JOE SCARBOROUGH, HOST, MSNBC: It was breathtaking.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: The fawning is so bad Jake Tapper at CNN was forced to call them out.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JAKE TAPPER, HOST, CNN: We can't ignore Parnas has a serious credibility problem.  NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL REPORTER: Yes.  TAPPER: He's under indictment for campaign finance charges. The foreign minister of Ukraine told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that he doesn't trust a word Parnas is saying. And yet, I see people out there in social media Democrats are acting as if this guy is the second coming of Theodore Roosevelt or something.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: And while Democrats desperately try to save their failed impeachment push, President Trump just put together a legal dream team by adding Ken Starr, Robert Ray, and other top-notch lawyers, and Alan Dershowitz says he will make a constitutional argument against impeachment. OK, Greg Gutfeld, star witness. Lev Parnas.  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Yes.  WATTERS: A lot of blockbuster revelations.  GUTFELD: Yes. He has the stench of Avenatti mix with -- who's that other dude that they thought was going to be the next big thing?  KENNEDY MONTGOMERY, FOX NEWS HOST: Michael Cohen.  GUTFELD: Michael Cohen. Anyway. Because this is Friday. I'm starting a new thing it's called good news Greg.  WATTERS: OK.  GUTFELD: Would you like to see good news Greg? Because everybody says I'm being too negative so I'm really going to be really positive. So, I'm going to start with this one point. For the media and half the government to indulge this farce, things have to be pretty good for this country, right? It's not like America is missing these clowns at the Capitol or at CNN. Why is that? And this is the irony, is that the successful state of the country has enabled this farce to continue. It's like -- it's like a peacock with his feathers. He can like, it's something that he can just carry along because he can. So, it's actually a good sign. And you know who I haven't quoted in a while?  WATTERS: Who? Scott?  GUTFELD: Yes, Scott Adams.  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Drink.  GUTFELD: Here -- everybody drink. OK. Trump has had the best month probably in his administration. He's got two trade deals, he killed the terrorist, he got the stock market breaking new records. So, what is, what could be behind this? According to Adams, Trump thrives on competition. And the fact is, impeachment is actually making him a better president because he's counter programming with achievements against their constant attacks on him. It's kind of like The Five. The Five only does great when there's a little spark of combat between us. If we all sit around here and agree, the audience gets bored and nobody watches. So that's what he is actually counter programming. And the more they impeach him, the better he does. That's great news. They should keep impeaching him. If they keep impeaching him, he will be the greatest president in the history of the universe.  WATTERS: Yes, Juan, I mean, can't you argue with that? I mean, that's air tight logic right there.  MONTGOERY: Yes.  PERINO: Yes.  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: You know sometimes you think it's Friday. You know, just give him a break.  GUTFELD: Friday is high day.  WILLIAMS: Why is that?  WATTERS: What do you think?  WILLIAMS: High day? I don't know what he's talking about. All right. All right. All right. You're going to have a drink after the show. Let's put it that way.  MONTGOMERY: After? What?  WILLIAMS: He already started. It's five o'clock somewhere. I think Lev Parnas there's lots of reason to doubt lev Parnas. The guy is indictment, right? The guy looks like he's a criminal. So, I think yes, you should be doubting him and he may be trying to get himself a better deal. Although I can't understand why his lawyers would have him out on TV given that he's under indictment and he should be talking to the prosecutors. But I will say that this is an opportunity given what he's saying for people to try to corroborate, to look into exactly is there any basis for the kinds of things that he is alleging took place about, especially about the president's involvement, the president lying stands out, the possible attack on -- led by the president against a U.S. ambassador --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: Would you, though, see Greg's point that it's been a spectacular month for the president in terms of accomplishment --  WILLIAMS: God.  WATTERS: -- on trade and on terror and on the economic side of the thing?  WILLIAMS: He's had some legitimate accomplishments.  WATTERS: Yes. I'd say that it's pretty good, Juan.  WILLIAMS: But this whole business, Greg keeps telling, America is doing fine, America is doing great. Look, life always gets better, but the fact that we have a person --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Under a Republican.  WILLIAMS: Yes. Look at Bill Clinton's economy. Barack Obama, what a lovely president.  GUTFELD: And we were able to endure Clinton's escapades in the Oval Office.  WILLIAMS: If not like this. This is something that I think speaks to who we are as an American people. I think this is chaotic, I think it's at times bullying and bad examples for us all and I think it's racist at times.  GUTFELD: It's an emotional argument.  WILLIAMS: Sorry.  WATTERS: I don't know. A lot of people think it's just entertaining fun. Kennedy?  WILLIAMS: Is that the best you can do?  WATTERS: Yes. I got -- a lot more where that came from.  WILLIAMS: OK. Yes.  WATTERS: Kennedy, what did you -- what did you think about the media saying that this guy is going to be the silver bullet and this is the guy that's going to finally take down Trump? Just like we had Avenatti and Michael Cohen and James Comey and Robert Mueller. This guy, Lev is going to be the guy.  MONTGOMERY: And he's, Parnas is already eating his words at least to the New York Times. They said that he corrected the record and said I actually didn't meet with the president at that White House dinner. My bad. But I know the news cycle is very, very quick. And I know we go through these stories so quickly. In fact, that we have completely forgotten about World War III --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: That's right.  GUTFELD: Two weeks ago.  MONTGOMERY: -- that we're supposed to be right smacked up in the middle of.  WATTERS: He has t avoid World War III.  MONTGOMERY: Yes. And now, you know, we are talking about phase one of the China deal. We're talking about signing USMCA. We're not talking this dire impending global instability. We're talking about this guy. And if the news cycle is so quick your memory has to be a little bit longer than that especially if you were an objective reporter and you have to remember that people like -- there with pundits and anchors on MSNBC and CNN who were laughably pushing Michael Avenatti as a potential Democrat nominee for president. And he was just rearrested for violating --  WATTERS: He is behind bars now.  MONTGOMERY: Yes.  WATTERS: Harder on for president like that.  MONTGOMERY: So, I don't know why they would think -- if the president of a corrupt country like Ukraine is saying this Parnas guy, I believe a word that comes out of his mouth.  WATTERS: Yes.  MONTGOMERY: If he's saying that, then I would just exercise a little more skepticism.  WILLIAMS: So, wouldn't you say though this might be a reason to call witnesses?  MONTGOMERY: Yes. Because that way, that way, Juan --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: Where is Hunter? Let's call him. All right.  MONTGOMERY: -- you can keep Bernie and Nancy and Amy off the campaign trail until Nevada 2024.  WILLIAMS: Well, no. But you say hey, if this Lev Parnas is such a terrible guy --  (CROSSTALK)  MONTGOMERY: Hold on.  WATTERS: I'll see you Lev Parnas and I'll raise you the whistleblower and Hunter.  WILLIAMS: Yes.  WATTERS: OK. Can we go to MSNBC it seems like now they're just trying to shame Republicans into doing what they want? Here's Joe Scarborough.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SCARBOROUGH: We all know why Lindsey saying he doesn't want a fair trial. he's not going to provide a fair trial. History is going to treat these politicians very badly. And if you're retiring, you can actually -- you have the luxury or if you're Mitt Romney, you have the luxury of saying hey, I'm going to do what's right and the American people want to hear all the evidence.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: Like the Brady bunch up there.  GUTFELD: An unattractive --  PERINO: Though they don't get along as well.  WATTERS: Right. Right. So, what do you think about the shame game?  PERINO: So, one of the games as impeachment got started was to go back to any of the politicians that were in office during the Clinton impeachment and play the things that they said then and the things that they're saying now and how you can basically switch them.  WATTERS: Yes.  PERINO: And the reason for that is that it is a political exercise. And both sides do it. Think of the people today who are all about me too and but they were the ones defending Bill Clinton back then.  WATTERS: yes.  PERINO: And now with Trump. You have people who might have said something different in 1999 who are saying something now. Lindsey Graham is one of those people. But here's the reason. This is not about a jury trial. This is an impeachment and we all know impeachment is a political exercise. So, each, the media wants the Republicans and back in the Clinton impeachment it was the same what the Republicans saying how could you possibly -- like this is disgusting. How could you deal -- this is horrible. And they tried to shame them into thinking that. And now the Democrats are trying to do that to Republicans and to Evangelicals. Right? How dare you. You say you're for all of these things.  WATTERS: Yes.  PERINO: And they seem to seem so indignant. But in eight years from now if we're covering an impeachment of a Democrat which we might because now they're just basically lowering the bar for impeachment so much, you'll see the same switch-a-roo.  WATTERS: And it's hard to shame politicians because they have no shame.  GUTFELD: It's going to be hard to impeach president West, though.  WILLIAMS: Is that Adam --  GUTFELD: Kanye.  WATTERS: Kanye. Kanye West.  WILLIAMS: I was looking for Batman.  WATTERS: All right. Coming up, disgraced former FBI director James Comey could be in some serious trouble. We'll tell you why next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PERINO: More trouble could be coming for James Comey. Federal prosecutors reportedly investigating whether the former FBI director leaked classified information to the media. Again, the New York Times reporting prosecutors are scrutinizing at least two news articles about the FBI and Comey that published back in 2017. They mentioned a secret Russian intelligence document, paid to have -- said to have played a key role in Comey's unilateral announcement to close the Clinton private server investigation. So, what a tangled web we continue to weave. And there seems to be, Juan, James Comey keeps coming up over and over again.  WILLIAMS: Yes. You think this is payback?  PERINO: Maybe.  WILLIAMS: You think a little back stabbing going on? Yu know what's the tail here is, like a poke. The tail here is they had to go back to 2017. This is nothing contemporary. They're looking to get James Comey. They've also got --  (CROSSTALK)  MONTGOMERY: But he wasn't an FBI director after 2017.  WILLIAMS: Yes. What? No, he wasn't.  MONTGOMERY: He was fired in 2017.  WILLIAMS: But that's -- if there was something done wrong then, you'd do it in line with the timing, Kennedy. So, they're also after --  (CROSSTALK)  MONTGOMERY: That's what I say about Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.  WILLIAMS: They're also now going against Andrew McCabe. That's another tale in this. This is about, you know, Bill Barr -- and Dana and I have argued about this. I thought Bill Barr look, he had a pretty good record under President Bush. Bring him back. He's a guy wo's seen as highly credible. But he has become President Trump's thuggish attorney general.  GUTFELD: Thuggish?  WATTERS: I remember when Eric Holder said he was Obama's wingman. And that didn't get any flak. I just think Bill Bar is a straight shooter. But here's what happened with Comey. He gets duped by fake Russia news, then leaks the fake Russia news he got duped by and now he is being investigated for it. This was with the Clinton e-mail investigation, which he botched. And then he goes and botches the Trump Russia investigation the same way, by getting duped by fake news, a.k.a. the dossier. He puts together this team of rogue FBI agents that doctor e-mails and lie to the courts so they could spy on the Trump campaign. And that's why people hate McCabe and James Comey.  WILLIAMS: Also, that's what's going on.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: Because they crumple on (Inaudible) and then they get multimillion book deal with fat contracts at CNN. And if you look back on what happened Trump was right, Comey was wrong. There was no collusion.  WILLIAMS: So, this is the reason --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: And he had every reason to fire James Comey. I'm just putting a little context.  WILLIAMS: OK.  WATTERS: And here's the context. He's a dangerous dude. He mishandled two highly sensitive FBI investigations. First the Clinton investigation. She deleted 30,000 e-mails under subpoena. If he had actually done his job, Bernie would have been the nominee. Then he frames Trump for collusion. Basically, cost the Republicans the mid-term elections. He's interfered in our elections more than the Russians if you look at it honestly.  WILLIAMS: Do you think the Democrats have an issue with that?  WATTERS: I think James -- the Dems hate him more than Trump.  WILLIAMS: Well, I'm just so --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: So, the guy has got bad instincts. And every time you call him out on it, he puts out on this boy scout routine.  WILLIAMS: OK. All right. So, he's not --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: He's a dirty cop.  WILLIAMS: I don't know about a dirty cop.  MONTGOMERY: He's not a cop.  WILLIAMS: That's wrong.  MONTGOMERY: That's -- OK. But that's actually law enforcement officers do not like James Comey because he doesn't understand their culture or the world. They come from it. It is always all about him. It's never about the people in the FBI.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: It is always about him. You're right.  MONTGOMERY: And unfortunately, under him, federal law enforcement has really suffered.  PERINO: Yes.  MONTGOMERY: And their reputation has suffered. And he allowed that and Andrew McCabe allowed that. And the fact that he was, you know, like a dirty lawyer nefariously leaking stuff to the New York Times and the Washington Post through an intermediary, that he admitted. He said that was the impetus for the Mueller investigation for launching that. He knew that would happen --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: But that's not what this is about.  MONTGOMERY: -- upon his firing.  WILLIAMS: This is a witch hunt. You both of you just --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: Witch hunt.  PERINO: OK. But --  WILLIAMS: You don't like James Comey.  PERINO: I know --  WILLIAMS: I may not like James Comey.  WATTERS: Juan said with hunt.  WILLIAMS: Why are you going back in time to go after this guy?  PERINO: He --  MONTGOMERY: Because those are the facts that happen to bolster the case --  WILLIAMS: That what?  MONTGOMERY: -- that he had a screw loose and he's a bad person.  WILLIAMS: Fine?  MONTGOMERY: He's a bad person with so much power, he could use the entire apparatus at his disposal to spy on a political campaign.  PERINO: And the FBI they are trying to rehabilitate their reputation of the FBI. And a state bureau chief -- a state level bureau chief would have been fired for the same thing.  GUTFELD: I'd like to go back and use a little of history to help everybody out here. Remember back in the 90s there was a TV show called ""Friends."" A very popular show. Remember how disappointed you were when you sit down to watch ""Friends"" and the episode would be about Phoebe?  WATTERS: Yes.  PERINO: Yes.  GUTFELD: Yes. And you're like I don't really care about Phoebe.  WATTERS: Yes.  GUTFELD: Well Comey is the Phoebe of American politics. I mean, he's always there in the background but I really don't want to hear about him anymore.  WATTERS: You want to hear about Ross.  GUTFELD: I think I want to hear about Ross or Joey.  PERINO: And Rachel.  GUTFELD: They were funny people. But it's like I feel like when he comes on, I feel like I'm watching episode two of series three. I've already gone through it. We know they all die at the end of ""Friends,"" by the way.  PERINO: Very sad.  GUTFELD: That's in the last season. They all die.  WATTERS: I didn't know that.  GUTFELD: yes. Yes. But Comey, Comey got famous and he enjoyed being famous. He should be a spokesman for a product, I was thinking something like depends. And you know, when you really need to stop a leak and he could just be sitting there and he's like very comfortable. Anyway.  PERINO: The Flex Seal that would be a good one.  GUTFELD: That Flex Seal that's a great one.  PERINO: Yes.  GUTFELD: Why not?  PERINO: Why not?  GUTFELD: I would like to do Lactaid or Sequel.  PERINO: Or the other one we're talking about in the commercial break.  WATTERS: Yes.  GUTFELD: Yes. We're not going to talk about that.  PERINO: The other one. The other one.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: I think Trump could do those new light bulbs for the --  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: All right. Coming up, CNN furious with Republican Senator Martha McSally over what she said to a reporter. We're going to show you next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WILLIAMS: It's a media uproar over this exchange between a CNN reporter and Republican Senator Martha McSally.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  MANU RAJU, SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Senator McSally, should the Senate consider new evidence as part of the impeachment trial?  SEN. MARTHA MCSALLY (R-AZ): Manu, you're a liberal hack. I'm not talking to you.  RAJU: You're not going to comment, Senator?  MCSALLY: You're a liberal hack.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: Wow. After McSally said that, CNN hosts raced to defend their colleague. Look at this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  WOLF BLITZER, HOST, CNN: It was disgusting, it was awful. She should know better. She or her staff no one has reached out to apologize to you, have they?  RAJU: I have not heard from them at all, Wolf.  CHRIS CUMO, HOST, CNN: This question was obvious. So was her dodge, so was the disrespect. It's all textbook Trump. She really acted like a punk.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: Whoa! And here's Senator McSally responding.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  MCSALLY: I'm a fighter pilot. You know? I called it like it is. And that's what we see out of the mainstream media and especially CNN every single day. So obviously I'm going to -- I'm going to tell the truth. The Democrat senators walk by and they say hi, how are you today and then they chase after the Republicans.  LAURA INGLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes.  MCSALLY: I mean, it's honestly ridiculous.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: All right. She can have a problem with CNN but I don't think that reporter's opinion -- that's not Joe Scarborough. So, I just thought it was over the top. But they certainly responded. You have to have thick skin if you're a reporter, powerful people are not going to like you if you're reporting the news. Dana, you have a lot of experience with news and being on either side of that fence. Do did you find that?  PERINO: You should have seen what I used to call reporters behind their backs.  WATTERS: Yes.  PERINO: I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. So, OK. A couple of things. Manu Raju I think is actually a very good reporter.  WILLIAMS: I agree.  PERINO: And you see him he works -- you see him he's always there along with our Chad Pergram, our Mike Emanuel walking the halls. He's working --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: I hate those guys.  PERINO: -- he's trying to do his job. I just think that for reporters it never works out if you become the story. Do you remember a few years ago when John McCormack got pushed in a scuffle?  WILLIAMS: Yes.  PERINO: And he got pushed down and he didn't want to be part of the story and everyone tried to make it into this whole thing how he was pushed by the Democratic candidates' guy. So, I wouldn't have done the whole thing at CNN. Like ignore it. Let -- he's going to have to go back to the Capitol every single day and do his job. So why blow it up into a big thing and say it's disgusting and demand apologies? That I didn't think was right. Now, however, I think the United States senators who are paid by the taxpayers who are answerable to their constituents and through the press, I don't think -- it didn't seem like her to me. Now she's -- maybe she's had it. And I get it. She's a fighter pilot but she's also in a very tough race in Arizona. And she got a lot of Atta girls from people from the right and I think that's one of the things that she was thinking.  WILLIAMS: Jesse?  WATTERS: Well, you know, Juan, I don't engage in name-calling. I don't like to bash the media.  WILLIAMS: OK.  WATTERS: I think they do a great job. So, I'm not going to -- no. I think you're right. I think all of these senators talk trash about reporters. They just don't do it to their face. She did it to his face and all hell broke loose. And then I thought to myself, how many times have senators and congressmen on the left said nasty stuff about us at Fox News? They have called us lunatics, hacks, conspiracy theorists. Things a lot worse.  GUTFELD: And there's there --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: Like a lot of people did.  GUTFELD: And then there's the inaccurate stuff.  WATTERS: You know, we don't go around and cry and put out press releases.  PERINO: And go on Hannity shows.  WATTERS: Yes.  WILLIAMS: No.  WATTERS: We would never act like the victim. When you're called names like that. But listen, he's not a hack but he's a liberal. He goes around and asks questions from a liberal perspective. He doesn't ask Chuck Schumer where is Hunter. He asks McSally, do you think we should call witnesses? That's fine. That's his job.  PERINO: But everybody is being asked, they are going to have to answer on Tuesday.  WATTERS: Yes, but they're answering questions from the Democratic perspective.  MONTGOMERY: Maybe -- maybe they have beef. Maybe they have an issue. Maybe he tweeted something about her or said something and she just continued to carry it. But he knows and every reporter who works in that gaggle knows that you have to have an explosive bite in order to get on. Because they do that all day long. They chase people around and every single interaction is not going to get on. But something like that is. And it's lonely and it's tough especially when other people gang up on you. It's a win-win for everyone.  WATTERS: Do you think this is good for Manu?  MONTGOMERY: I think -- I think it's good for him because all of his friends at CNN get to cry and they're like, how dare they. And they act so offended. And then people in Arizona are like I didn't know she had it in her. Good for her.  WILLIAMS: Hey, Greg.  MONTGOMERY: Because they probably have the same level of frustration. And you know, I've seen Joe Biden be so disrespectful to Peter Doocy. I think sometimes Peter Doocy asks some questions and he knows that the vice president is going to get very upset with him.  WATTERS: Yes. If sleepy Joe puts one finger on one hair of Peter Doocy's beautiful head, he's going to have to answer to me.  WILLIAMS: Really?  WATTERS: Yes.  WILLIAMS: What about his father? His dad -- OK. But let's look at Laura Ingraham asks Senator McSally the same question.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: What about Manu Raju's questions? Do you want witnesses?  MCSALLY: Well, I want a fair trial. Do it again in the House.  (CROSSTALK)  INGRAHAM: OK. You're not going to play the game --  MCSALLY: No, no, no.  INGRAHAM: You can call me a conservative hack. But do you want witnesses, yes or no? Why aren't you telling us?  MCSALLY: Because we're going to vote on Tuesday to start the trial and let them present --  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: Wow. So, Laura Ingraham says, I guess she is a conservative hack if Manu is a liberal hack.  GUTFELD: No because we -- let's avoiding the obvious here. The beef is about the network. This is a network that has pushed a three-year hoax. OK?  WATTERS: Right.  GUTFELD: So, everybody on the other side is like I'm tired of this crap. They also push the most anti-law enforcement narrative I've ever seen on TV before Trump was in office. So, there's an inherent bias about dividing America. I do hope that Manu gets the medical help that he needs for this grievous, grievous injury. Do they have a therapy llama in your bio or a therapy fairy that can keep him company? I just hope he's all right. I think that the word hack is not a good word. I think it's a lazy word. I don't think he's a hack. I think there are better words to come up with. But I think it's incredibly healthy for people in this world to view the press the same way that they look at pyramid schemes. That the only way the press can maintain power is to get you to believe in their story. And the sooner you realize that, the healthier you are. So the more antagonism towards the media there is, the better I feel. And I'm saying that as somebody who is in the media, but I loathe the media.  WILLIAMS: Yes, I noticed.  PERINO: Self-loathing.  WILLIAMS: All right, there's another media controversy brewing. It's over this New York Times op-ed headline, Megan McCain has a problem -- The View has a problem with Megan McCain. The piece goes on to say, ""for some viewers, Miss McCain is the privilege product of conservative nepotism, capitalism, and the American military-industrial complex."" Miss McCain responding on Twitter, ""If the New York Times wants to understand the country, maybe they should try having one woman in the room who doesn't accept their groupthink on guns, abortion, and religion. Apparently, that's too much for them."" Ladies?  MONTGOMERY: Megan --  GUTFELD: Are you referring to me?  WILLIAMS: You know I wouldn't do that.  MONTGOMERY: Megan works really hard. And she's worked hard for a long time. She's worked in media for a long time. And she's definitely put her time in. And the reason people talk about her is because she researches her topics and challenges people that otherwise conservative journalists wouldn't have access to. And, you know, I think there are disloyal people who work at her show, who have personal agendas, and they're servicing their own careers and the media by planting these stories. And I think it's a bad look, not only for The View but for ABC, and they need to clean up their culture.  PERINO: But has any show ever had this sustained amount of disarray and disgruntlement for years way before even Megan McCain got this?  WATTERS: What about this show?  PERINO: Well, we don't get in it -- but I think it's different because we laugh about it.  GUTFELD: We love each other. We laugh and we love. Look, you know what kills me about this story is that they published this article. It was like a crank letter. You know when somebody writes to Fox? Those girls on T.V. at THE FIVE, their skirts are too short, and Greg Gutfeld uses bad language. I heard him use ""damn"" the other day. I'm turning off the set unless Juan apologizes. It's a crank letter. The New York Times published a crank letter because friends in high places, right? There's somebody at ABC who's friends with somebody at the Times, because there's no way that would have been published if it wasn't --  PERINO: But also, how many of these people -- like I'm surprised at how many reporters watch The View and then write about it every day.  GUTFELD: Well, because they're home then.  PERINO: Yes, I guess.  WILLIAMS: They're home. What?  MONTGOMERY: They're also being -- they're also being (INAUDIBLE) that stuff. And again, like lock it up, you guys. Have some loyalty for where you work, the organization, and the show.  GUTFELD: I wrote a big piece on Jessie anonymously and that's coming out next week.  WILLIAMS: Jesse, give me your take. Because some people are Abby Huntsman, all the things that have been checked. Is that conservative versus conservative?  WATTERS: I think she does a good job on that show. She's outnumbered. She's like the Juan Williams of The View. She gets paid very well to be the lone voice and she gets paid well to take a beating. And yes, you know, her name is McCain so that opens doors. Just like Hunter Biden's name opens doors in Ukraine. One person is very talented without the last name an one's not. And one gets everything, Hunter, because of who he is. She can stand on her own.  WILLIAMS: You think you got a thing going for Hunter today?  WATTERS: Where is he, Juan?  WILLIAMS: All right, all right, here we go. Stay right there folks, the ""FASTEST SEVEN,"" a whole lot of Friday fun coming up for you next on THE FIVE.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  MONTGOMERY: Bet you. We just betted. All right, welcome back. It's time for the ""FASTEST SEVEN."" First up the LSU Tigers were at the White House today, but it's what happened right after at the big football game that's getting all the attention. There is an arrest warrant out for NFL star OBJ Odell Beckham Jr. after he did this in the locker room. He spanked his bottom. The cop apparently wanted to punch back him in the face, but kept his cool then saw the video and later press charges. Jesse, what do you make of this?  WATTERS: He shouldn't have been slapping the cop around like that. But the cop doesn't need to be in the locker room trying to crack down on champions smoking cigars. Why are they in the locker room? They're trying to celebrate? Get the cops out of there. Let them celebrate.  GUTFELD: He what's -- he wasn't a cop. That was actually a stripper. They hired a stripper.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: You know, that should be Odell's defense.  GUTFELD: Yes. I thought he was -- I thought he was --  WATTERS: I thought he was taking his clothes off.  GUTFELD: Don't strippers dress up as cops.  MONTGOMERY: Yes.  GUTFELD: It happens to me every time.  MONTGOMERY: We did that once to one of our executives at the MTV Beach House because the cops kept showing up with noise complaints. And so one showed up and she started crying because she thought the cops are there to arrest her. And then he's like -- but you know, can't you celebrate. You win the national championship. And then another police officer came in, it's like, smoke your cigars, boys.  PERINO: Yes. So there's plenty of other things that are happening in New Orleans where you would need officers' attention, smoking cigars, although I can't really imagine how much smoke was in there. I probably would have had to leave myself.  WILLIAMS: Yes, that's my feeling. I think a lot of things going on locker rooms, a lot of ass smacking, a lot of --  MONTGOMERY: What? That's right, Juan.  WILLIAMS: -- profanity, and lot of crazy.  PERINO: He's taking us back to the 80s.  WILLIAMS: But I must say, I must say, if you are in a locker room in this era, you should be aware of cameras, you should be aware of cell phones. And I guess you have to be aware, Jesse, of police, because I've never been in a locker room where they've been police but I don't think this is working. So he smacks the guy. He didn't smack him in the face. He touched -- in the locker room, how many guys are whipping towels.  WATTERS: Yes, he was saying good game.  PERINO: That should be his defense.  WATTERS: Right.  MONTGOMERY: Up next, we've seen standing desks and treadmill desks, Bret Baier has one, and those weird ball chairs that people still sit on, but could this be the next big office trend. Behold, the lie-down desk. It lets you work while flat on your back. You just lie down. Not cheap. It costs over $7,000. Do you already have one, Greg?  GUTFELD: Working horizontally? Isn't that what the Mustang Ranch is for? You kids don't understand. I am sick and tired of people making light of just normal sitting. We are made to sit OK. I'm tired -- I don't -- when I walk by my coworkers that are standing, I kick their legs out. I kick their legs out. They fall down and they ride in pain. And I say, get a damn chair because you're hurting the chair business. They're putting big chair out of business.  WATTERS: You have a lot of money tied up in big chairs?  GUTFELD: I got all my stocks. My 401(k) is all big chair. High chair as they call it.  MONTGOMERY: So Dana, is it -- is it a placebo effect because some of the reviews online like I'm so creative and productive now that I'm lying down.  PERINO: It's like the -- it's like the weighted blanket craze and everyone thought they needed a weighted blanket so they could go to sleep. Like you don't really need one. You don't need it. I got a balance board to be standing on at my standing desk.  WATTERS: Balance board?  GUTFELD: Oh my god.  PERINO: Yes.  MONTGOMERY: My 10-year-old has a hoverboard. And she just hovers around the apartment with her laptop open.  GUTFELD: I sit in a bath of hot oil.  MONTGOMERY: That might explain your mood.  WATTERS: You said -- you said Bret Baier has what?  PERINO: Treadmill desk.  WATTERS: So he runs while he --  MONTGOMERY: No, he walks. He said he can -- he can clock like six miles a day on that thing. It's very impressive.  WATTERS: Really.  WILLIAMS: I tell you what's impressive, the cost of this thing. So in other words --  MONTGOMERY: $7,000.  WILLIAMS: This is like you could get a peloton. I think some people here have done it for -- I think you goodbye like almost three pelotons for this thing. So what is this about? This is like an indulgence?  PERINO: Yes.  WILLIAMS: It's not about --  MONTGOMERY: Do you -- do you remember the movie Wally where people are so fat in the future, they just like, glide around in these chairs because they can't stand up and they eat out of cups. That's it. We're turning into Wally like we're so stupidly lazy that we can't even be bothered to sit up and work. I Must recline.  PERINO: But it might help your back a little bit, or your front.  MONTGOMERY: Finally, have you been sick with the flu this season? It turns out our booming economy may be to blame -- seriously. Researchers say job growth is bringing more people into the workplace, and that could increase the spread of the virus. Greg, you've always said you like to be the infected monkey.  GUTFELD: Yes.  MONTGOMERY: You like to be the person --  GUTFELD: You know, it's kind of -- I have the same philosophy about zombies. It's like, why are you scared of zombies? Just become one and then people are scared of you, right? This study is wrong. It's because of the holidays. The holidays cause the flu because people are on planes. And with a good economy, they're flying more, so everybody spread it.  Like my wife and I, we got the flu coming back from your damn wedding. I was in bed for six days because of you, Jesse.  MONTGOMERY: Yes, but you lost weight. You look great.  GUTFELD: Thank you.  WATTERS: You were late to the wedding, Greg.  GUTFELD: Well, yes.  WATTERS: And I still haven't gotten a gift, by the way. Was my gift your presence at the wedding?  PERINO: Yes, that was the present.  WATTERS: You know, I think the bigger problem is people don't get the flu shot. The vaccine thing.  GUTFELD: That is true.  WILLIAMS: This is like, all right, people going to get the flu, but why we have the sense in America -- and I run to so many people, oh, I don't get the flu shot. I think I get sick if I get the flu shot. Get the flu shot, will you?  PERINO: It's true though. Like the economy is good so people -- the planes are packed, people are traveling either for business but -- or for fun, and that's -- it does spread so you have to just be careful. You know, take care of yourself.  WATTERS: Dana, they're blaming Trump for the flu. That's what this is.  PERINO: No, actually -- no, no, no.  WATTERS: The economy is so good --  PERINO: Turn it around, Jesse. Turn it around and say it is a great sign that there's the flu because President Trump has given us the greatest economy so now we can have more flu. It's fabulous.  WATTERS: That's right?  PERINO: That's how you turn it around.  MONTGOMERY: Don't go anywhere. ""FAN MAIL FRIDAY"" is up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: I love sticks. All right, it's ""FAN MAIL FRIDAY,"" answering your questions. First question from Kristine S. If you film your own commercial for the Super Bowl, what item would it be for, Jesse?  WATTERS: Probably that lay down chair.  GUTFELD: Yes.  WATTERS: I'd probably have a sponsorship with the laydown chair. And you can just fake like you're sleeping when you're supposed to be working. That's what that's about.  GUTFELD: OK.  WATTERS: First of all, price tag of $7,000.  GUTFELD: Dana?  PERINO: Healthy dog food.  GUTFELD: Oh, interesting.  PERINO: Then you have -- like I could have Jasper in the commercial.  GUTFELD: Of course.  PERINO: And I could get some promote -- some like free dog food.  GUTFELD: Oh, there you go. Always working the angle. That's what they say, the Dana angle, working the Dana angle, Juan.  WILLIAMS: That's what they said?  GUTFELD: That's what they say.  WILLIAMS: Wait a second. So I got -- I can think of three categories. So beer.  GUTFELD: Yes.  WILLIAMS: Beer has got to be big, right?  GUTFELD: Yes.  WILLIAMS: Then snack food. Snack foods is got to be big, and cars.  GUTFELD: Yes.  WILLIAMS: So I think I would pick snack food.  GUTFELD: OK.  WILLIAMS: I like the toes as my kids call the Doritos, Fritos.  GUTFELD: And human toes.  WILLIAMS: They're not bad, either.  GUTFELD: I have a whole jar of them in the basement.  PERINO: Grose.  GUTFELD: What was that era when I used to pick up drifters? Kennedy.  MONTGOMERY: I think I would like -- I would like to sell hot freedom.  GUTFELD: Hot freedom.  MONTGOMERY: I'm not sure what it is, but I think it's a full-body rub.  GUTFELD: Yes.  MONTGOMERY: You just rub it all over your body and all of a sudden, you love the Constitution in these United States of America.  GUTFELD: I would sell a combination, my pillow, Tommy John underwear. It's underwear that you can use as a pillow or a pillow that you can wear as underwear.  MONTGOMERY: That's brilliant.  WATTERS: And make it gold.  GUTFELD: And make gold, exactly.  WILLIAMS: No, no, no, silver.  GUTFELD: Silver.  WATTERS: Sorry, silver.  GUTFELD: And you can keep -- and you can keep it in your safe. All right, what's in your safe? All right, what is the one thing you are embarrassingly bad at, Dana?  PERINO: I don't know.  WATTERS: Oh, good, pretend like you can't think of something. Come on, Dana.  PERINO: No, I mean, I'm bad at all sorts of things. I don't know. I probably have to say a sport, probably.  GUTFELD: OK, sports.  PERINO: Yes.  GUTFELD: Jesse.  WATTERS: I'm a really bad singer.  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: I'm a terrible singer.  WATTERS: You can't have mine. Like in church, like I'm so meek and church. The minute I say one thing, people start looking around. That's why I don't go to church.  GUTFELD: That's true. I did stop going to church because I don't like the singing part.  WATTERS: I'm just bad singer. I don't like to sing.  GUTFELD: I also -- I also don't like the handshaking thing.  WATTERS: Yes?  GUTFELD: Because I don't want -- I don't want --  PERINO: But the economy is great so you could get the flu.  GUTFELD: Kennedy?  MONTGOMERY: I'm bad at acting.  GUTFELD: Oh, yes.  MONTGOMERY: Really, really bad. And so the creator of CSI New York was like I wrote a part for you and it is yours. All you have to do is come read it. And they're like, oh, you're really bad at acting. I'm sorry, we can't go with you.  GUTFELD: Juan?  WILLIAMS: You know, when I go to the beach, all the guys go out in the ocean. We try to do handstands and I will try and try and flip and flop and the wave comes and knocks me down and try again. I'm just -- I'm --  WATTERS: You flipflop all the time.  WILLIAMS: That's it.  PERINO: Is you family trying to kill you?  MONTGOMERY: I'm bad at saying no.  WATTERS: It's like hold him underwater.  GUTFELD: You're bad at saying no.  PERINO: Yes.  GUTFELD: That's like the title of a -- like a cautionary tale for teenage girls, bad at saying no. The story of little Dora or whatever. I didn't even think about it. I can't act. I can't act because you know you can't -- you can't -- I can't --  WATTERS: I've seen -- I've seen the GG show.  GUTFELD: But that's not acting. I can't --  WATTERS: That's not acting?  GUTFELD: I cannot write fiction. I tried to write fiction but I don't take myself seriously.  MONTGOMERY: Scott Adams writes fiction.  GUTFELD: That is true.  WATTERS: But do we have to drink when she's -  GUTFELD: Yes. All right, ""ONE MORE THING"" next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WATTERS: It's time now for ""ONE MORE THING."" Has anybody here had a hole on one?  PERINO: Never.  WATTERS: Maybe in mini-golf, right, but not really. OK. American Express classic, this year, a guy with one arm does it.  PERINO: Awesome.  WATTERS: One-armed golfer, his name's Laurent Hurtubise. He's an amateur. Hole in one from 151 feet.  PERINO: Awesome.  WATTERS: In the cup. Unbelievable. 500 par after the first round. We're going to follow it over the weekend. Also, this weekend ""WATTERS WORLD"" 8:00 p.m. Eastern time. We have Eric Trump. He's the son of the President. He's one of the sons. What they call first family member. He'll be on ""WATTERS WORLD.""  WILLIAMS: What was that about?  WATTERS: No, for people that don't know who he is.  WILLIAMS: Do you think we don't know --  WATTERS: I'm trying to explain it, Juan.  WILLIAMS: He has a last name.  WATTERS: Yes, Trump. I mean, he did -- not every Trump is related to the president.  WILLIAMS: OK. All right, all right.  WATTERS: I'm just trying to explain it, Juan. Who knows who's watching? Greg.  GUTFELD: That was a hole in one.  WATTERS: Thank you.  GUTFELD: All right, tomorrow, the ""GREG GUTFELD SHOW"" 10:00 p.m. I got Lawrence Jones, I got comedian David Angelo, Kat Timpf, and Tyrus. That's Saturday, January 18, 10:00 p.m. Watch it or I will hate you. Let's do one of these.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Animals are great. Animals are great. Animals are great.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: They're laying off the animals. Hey, you know what, I hate the ocean and you should hate the ocean too. The ocean is evil. Everything in it is evil and wet. You know what I hate about the ocean? It's hard to stand on a boat. Unless you have seen this.  PERINO: This is great.  GUTFELD: Check out Maggie the Welsh Terrier has the most impressive sea legs you'll ever see.  WATTERS: Nice lean.  GUTFELD: Look at that. That's like me walking home from the bar. Just kidding, I never walk home.  WATTERS: You have a driver on standby.  GUTFELD: Yes. I have a driver on standby. He takes me to every bar. Vito, he's a great guy.  WATTERS: All right, Dana.  GUTFELD: RIP Vito.  WATTERS: All right, so we have a friend Jillian Cardarelli. We've talked about her before. She's a country music star out in Nashville. And she has a new song out called Cool Girl. Check it out here.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JILLIAN CARDARELLI, SINGER: We can dance around and around this thing. Baby here's the thing. I'm not trying to be the cool girl.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: That song came out to at midnight and it's available at Spotify, Apple Music, Google Play, and anywhere else you get your music from. It's Cool Girl by Jillian Cardarelli.  GUTFELD: That's a big cat.  WATTERS: It's a good song.  PERINO: Yes, she's a big cat.  GUTFELD: That's a big cat.  WATTERS: Yes, it's a big cat. Juan.  WILLIAMS: I don't do this very often but you know what, it's Friday. Happy Birthday Betty White. The famous actress turns 98 today. Born 1922, Oak Park, Illinois. Got her start on radio, but you know to all of us, she's known for TV. She's been a TV star since the late 40s appearing on game shows and sitcoms. You know our best though from the Golden Girls.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You're not going to believe this, but I have said all the story about this.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: I don't --  WILLIAMS: Yes. Do you know that she won a Daytime Emmy for hosting game shows? Pat Sajak is watching this. I mentioning that. And so happy birthday to Betty White who is one of Hollywood's best-known animal rights activists. So we look forward to celebrating your 100th, Betty.  WATTERS: She knows that animals are great. You and Betty have a lot in common.  GUTFELD: Yes, we dated for a while in the 90s, her 90s.  WATTERS: All right, Kennedy.  MONTGOMERY: Thank you for being a friend, Juan. That was very sweet. Well, today marks the 100th anniversary of the beginning of prohibition. So I went to an authentic original speakeasy that operated during Prohibition right here in New York City. Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The interesting thing about the prohibition time, people think now with the mixology was all about taste, and that's where recipes came from. No. Recipes came from the fact to discolor a drink --  MONTGOMERY: Get out. Really?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.  MONTGOMERY: So something like a slow Gin Fizz or Brandy Alexander which is a cream-based brandy cognac drink with a little bit of chocolate liquor, that was -- so they would think that you're just having some chocolate milk.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Throw off the feds. You know, desperate times, desperate measures.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  MONTGOMERY: You can see the full video on Twitter @KennedyNation.  GUTFELD: What's your head coat?  MONTGOMERY: I always wear -- when have you see me without a hat.  GUTFELD: That is true.  MONTGOMERY: In civilian attire, I always wear hat.  GUTFELD: You're a hat person.  WATTERS: I don't think we should celebrate prohibition. I don't think we should have anniversaries commemorating it. That's like Nancy handing out the articles of impeachment.  MONTGOMERY: Oh, you know what, Jesse?  WATTERS: All right. That's all for us. Have a great weekend, everybody.

Phillip: Senator Warren, what did you think when Senator Sanders told you a woman could not win the election? Warren: I disagreed. Was that a question, or an Abbott and Costello routine?

103,FOX,"Trump call Democrats' impeachment case a 'complete hoax'; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" January 16, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everyone. I am Dana Perino, along with Dagen McDowell, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld, 5:00 in New York City. Greg and I are wearing the same color. Capitol Hill bracing for an impeachment battle in the Senate while Democrats facing growing criticism for how they have handled the process up to now. Earlier today, impeachment articles were presented and read aloud by the Democratic managers, and Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts swore in senators as jurors. Now, those are all formalities. Then there is the little partisan battle. Nancy Pelosi and her impeachment managers being blasted by Republicans for handing out souvenir impeachment pens during what was supposed to be a somber ceremony yesterday. And Adam Schiff is under fire for dumping documents from Rudy Giuliani associate, Lev Parnas, after the House wrapped its investigations. The GOP senators, they're pushing back.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They've given us two very weak articles of impeachment. Our job is to look at what they bought us and if it rises to the level of impeachment.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The same witnesses are saying they need today. We're available in the House. You know if you want a witness and the witness was available to you and you chose not to call them, don't blame me.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If they wanted to call these witnesses, they could've called them. It is not our job to expand the impeachment.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: And the president is reacting to it all.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think it should go very quickly. It's a hoax. It's a hoax. Everybody knows that. It's a complete hoax. And he is a corrupt politician named Adam Schiff. And he made up a phone call. He went out, you will hear about this as you grow older. He went out and he said things. He said quid pro quo eight times. It was no times.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: And there was, of course, media reaction. I want to play the sound bite from Joe Scarborough. He was talking about what the defenders of Trump will be treated like in the future, if we could play that please.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We know that all of these characters, Rudy Giuliani, will be exposed for what he is. History, it will be bleak. And their families, their children, their grandchildren, everyone who has their last name will carry that around with them.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: Greg, I thought I'd come to you.  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: I think that's really brave of him to indict his own family and his own offspring. Don't you think that was brave of him? Because wasn't he a key player in electing Trump? Wasn't he the one that kissed his ass at the start of this whole thing and pleaded to have him on? We need to put his kids and his family on trial. Anyway, I'm kidding. His kids shouldn't go to jail or anything. They should be forced to watch Morning Joe every single day as punishment. Look, we know the ending to this story. Yet, we have to cover this non-stop, the constant scenes of people walking as if this is an achievement that they can walk into an open space without collapsing. So that is a big deal. But one thing I noticed is that these people are working, right? And we are fine, which means that all of these politicians that are walking around creating this phoney, pomp and circumstance are totally unnecessary to the smooth running of a country. All you really need is Trump. Trump's on his own getting the stuff done. You have all these other idiots wandering around, trying to look serious. And the more serious they look, the more comical they become. The beauty of this is they are going to lose, right. But we are going to let them go through this and let them work it all out. But these clowns like Nadler and Schiff, they are not in control. So when they start talking about witnesses, no witnesses. They want you to believe that the TV witnesses, the people that are on Maddow, are actually hearing witnesses. No, those are TV witnesses. Those are for the ratings to get the people to watch the shows, but they are not real witnesses, so they won't be there.  PERINO: I was thinking about this, the whole walking thing.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: Part of the reason there is walking is that the founding fathers set up the system, right? But if the founding fathers had email, I don't think they would've walked it.  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: No, they didn't. But I recall, and Juan didn't believe that I was old enough to remember in the 90s when the Republicans impeached Clinton. They just did it on a Saturday. They had some runner run it over to the secretary of the Senate on a Saturday. It wasn't carried lives. No one slow-mowed the walking, and they didn't -- also treated the way Nancy treated it. She said she's and somber. And she's wisecracking, smiling, and handing out souvenirs. She is so see-through. Abuse of power, it's not like the president spied on an opposing presidential campaign. Obstruction, it's not like he bleached 30,000 emails under subpoena. I mean, what do you have? Nancy said she cares so much about national security, when in her career has she been tough on the Russians, the Chinese, the terrorists? She wants the border to be like a sieve. This is about protecting the Constitution, really, Nancy? The First Amendment, the Second Amendment, Due process, speedy trial? Which one is it, Nancy? Election integrity, really, OK, then pass a voter ID laws. Or is she just trying to pay back Trump for zeroing in on the Biden family shenanigans. That's that is what this is all about. I mean, Hillary paid for foreign interference in the election to the tune of $9 million for a fake dossier. And then the GAO comes out and says tsk, tsk. Trump broke a rule by delaying aid. GAO said Obama broke a rule with the Bergdahl trade, said George W. Bush broke a rule. Maybe Joe Biden broke a rule when he delayed the aid unless Ukraine fired the prosecutor who was investigating his son. It happens in every administration. It's no big deal. Trump was just kicking the tires on an administration that was new and rife with corruption. And he got the money out under the wire. And the Ukrainians didn't even have to do anything. Lastly, this guy, Lev Parnas, whatever his name is, this guy is like the Michael Avenatti. You know, at the last second they are throwing out gang rate claims all of a sudden. You are supposed to take this guy seriously. He says he never even spoken to Donald Trump. He just paid Rudy Giuliani to make money off of his name. He said Devin Nunes went to Vienna and met with the prosecutor about Joe Biden. He's never been to Vienna. And now CNN is getting sued for reporting that Lev lied. Lev said he was speaking to the Ukrainian foreign minister about all this. The Ukrainian foreign minister went on CNN yesterday and said I never met the guy. Don't trust a word he says.  PERINO: Don't forget that the business was called Fraud Guarantee.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: They want to play a sound bite. Is this the one about Lev Parnas? Let's play that.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't want to make any judgments about his credibility, or others, until we have the opportunity to flush that out.  SEN. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): There seems to be documentation that would validate what Parnas is saying, but that all has to be subjected to scrutiny.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: Juan, what about this evidence coming out after the House has already closed down its shop and sent the articles over? Do you think that this should be allowed into the Senate trial?  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: I do.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: why?  WILLIAMS: Because one of the articles of impeachment literally is obstruction. And what you had was people being told they can't testify, John Bolton being the prime example, Dana, who have direct, firsthand knowledge of what took place. And so if we're all curious, if we all want to know exactly what happened, and the president says it was a perfect call. Why not let people with firsthand knowledge come and say something? Now, Lev Parnas has firsthand knowledge that the president lied, that he had direct knowledge that, in fact, there was a quid pro quo of what Gordon Sunderland, the ambassador said, was a clear effort to use U.S. money as leverage against the Ukraine, money that have been approved by Congress to get dirt on Joe Biden. So, you know, it doesn't seem as if there is much doubt about the specific crime. There are simply people who say, well, it's not worthy of impeachment. But I also want to take this opportunity, because I don't often do this, to pay tribute to Greg Gutfeld, because who would guess that Mitchell McConnell would be following -- by the way, marching, like you know they marched. He's marching behind Greg on this pen thing, because the grievance industry on the Republican side is now, oh, why are you giving away pens.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: I want to get Dagen in on that, and you can talk about the pens or anything else you want. Can we play this Republican outrage about the pens?  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Speak of the speaker distributed souvenir pens, souvenir pens, to her own colleagues, emblazoned with her golden signature.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Democrats did what you would expect at a campaign event. Pose for pictures, smiled, handed out gifts to one another.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm sure most of you got a pen as well.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We thought that she may have some grand strategy for delaying the impeachment trial for 28 days. Maybe she was just waiting for her special order pens to come in.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: Pens.  DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS HOST: And dressed in the color of an Easter egg. Wasn't that pretty? I'm just here to listen to Greg do his Yosemite Sam again. I'm not even getting paid for this. I'm paying for this seat.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Yesterday, when the two of you started --  (CROSSTALK)  MCDOWELL: No.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: No, look, you brought it up. Our audience have to sit through this garbage for hours. They come to The Five to hear the truth, and that this is a farce. I'm sorry, go ahead.  WILLIAMS: Our audience comes to hear the truth. I'm glad you said that, because I think they want to hear what is going on. Not just the grievance rage that comes from the right --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: If you want to dance to the jukebox of the Democrats, that's fine, but I'm not going to do it.  (CROSSTALK)  MCDOWELL: I go from DEFCON Five to DEFCON One, peace time down to global thermonuclear war in a sneeze, but I'm not going to do that right now. I'm going to address one thing that you said. The fact that all this information is coming out, the Government Accountability Report, oh, here is Lev Parnas with that hideous hairdo, with some new dirt on President Trump, and what Rudy Giuliani was doing. It is proof that Pelosi and co. and co. rushed and botched this impeachment, blinded by their own rage at Trump getting elected, and clouded -- their judgment clouded their faculties impaired by their hatred of him, and all the gun toting, bible carrying deplorables out there who voted for him. They released this. They don't control the investigation anymore. It's in the hands of the Senate. And to your point, you know, they're not doing anything and look how great the country is running. Look at the stock market.  (CROSSTALK)  MCDOWELL: You know what? Their ineptitude is proof that the Trump doctrine on the economy works. Get out of the way, let --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Even the GAO says the man committed a crime, and you are saying, so what?  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: -- the Democratic debate, new audio reveals what Elizabeth Warren said to Bernie Sanders. Don't miss Greg's monologue up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: If you've watched any of the Democratic debate, you would think someone drugged your food. You will find more signs of life on the moon. But the story is no longer about the forgettable candidates but a network that once again asserts its own biases into the event. Here is CNN's Abby Phillip questioning Sanders and then Warren over Liz's accusation that Bernie said a woman couldn't win in 2020.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Senator Sanders, I do want to be clear here. You are saying that you never told Senator Warren that a woman could not win the election?  SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: That is correct.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Senator Warren, what did you think when Senator Sanders told you a woman could not win the election?  SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I disagreed.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Perfect. Was that a question or an Abbott and Costello routine? That might be the funniest debate moment I've ever seen. One more time, please.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Senator Sanders, I do want to be clear here. You are saying that you never told Senator Warren that a woman could not win the election?  SANDERS: That is correct.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Senator Warren, what did you think when Senator Sanders told you a woman could not win the election?  WARREN: I disagreed.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: I will never get sick of that. So once again, CNN intercedes on behalf of a candidate. Remember when Candy Crowley shielded Obama from Mitt, and when Hillary got debate questions before facing Bernie? Now, I ain't no Bernie bro. He's a socialist and spent his adult life on the wrong side of history, but that's unfair. And the Dems should be worried. Without original thinkers like Yang or Tulsi, those on stage seemed bored by their own words. Biden disappeared into the podium as Tom Steyer stared at you like a glazed stalker on the subway. It seemed a group unprepared to face Trump. In fact, if you were some space alien and saw two screens, one with the debate and the other with a Trump rally, you would think these debates were beamed from different planets. One populated by meek insignificant creatures, and the other ruled by fierce monsters with unusual hair. If I were that alien, I know which planed I would happily invade and which one I would steer clear of. The fact is your party is in trouble when the most memorable moment comes from a moderator. I say CNN should be embarrassed, but, you know, that is impossible. All right, so we have this new audio of Sanders and Warren going at it, accusing each other of being liars from the debate. Let's roll that.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  WARREN: I think you called me a liar on national TV.  SANDERS: What?  WARREN: I think you called me a liar on national TV.  SANDERS: Let's not do it now. Let's not have this discussion on TV right now.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I just want to say, hi, Bernie.  SANDERS: Yes, good.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: I don't want to get in the middle of it. I just want to say hi, Bernie. That guy's running for president. Dana, he called her a liar. Does the moccasin fit?  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: That was a good one. I have a theory.  GUTFELD: Please, tell me a theory.  PERINO: Elizabeth Warren hasn't really talked about gender this whole campaign. She's talking about her plans. But as soon as the plans -- she gave details to the plan, Medicare for all, and she started tanking. So she started to take this turn. And a candidate, at this point in the race, starting to take a turn is someone who knows she is tanking.  GUTFELD: Interesting, desperate.  PERINO: And also, it takes a lot to make a lot of people on the right feel very sympathetic for Bernie Sanders.  GUTFELD: Exactly. The dude is a commie. And I felt bad for him, Juan. Juan, be honest, worst debate ever. I mean, we didn't have a chance to talk about it right after, but did you stay awake during it?  WILLIAMS: Yes, I watched it. But I got to say. I think you're right about CNN. I just thought that was unfair of CNN of them. Now, I understand the CNN reporting has backed up what Elizabeth Warren said, that in fact, Sanders said he didn't think a woman could beat Trump.  WATTERS: But how did they back that up if they weren't in the room?  WILLIAMS: Because they did reporting and they went to other people who heard from her contemporaneously that that's what she --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: She could've gotten it wrong, Juan.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: She is a congenital liar.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: I must you guys have become Bernie bros, along with Donald Trump, who says Bernie is more easily to beat then the man I am going to the Ukraine to get information on, Joe Biden. But I think that one of the differences between what you saw there, and let's going back to the GOP debates in 2016, is I don't think that Democrats want to put on the most entertaining boxing match. I think they're actually looking for someone who has ideas, someone who says here's the reality of this moment and how we can defeat Donald Trump. And so people are looking for that. They're not somebody to put nicknames and mockery.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: OK, Dagen. Because they're not going at each other, there is absolutely no impression of strength. They seem meek. When you ask them questions, they seem like they're just -- there's seems like there is no fire.  MCDOWELL: That's part of the problem. But again, because Bernie Sanders was wronged by Hillary Clinton, because they took over the DNC and sidelined him, he raised $1.7 million for more than 100,000 small donors just in that one day of the debate. So she -- take it from a woman who can spot a needy woman. Elizabeth Warren is gasping for attention at this point. And she is spitting on every hardworking woman in this country by lying to get ahead. Being smart wasn't enough. Being driven wasn't enough. She lied about her ethnicity. I wanted Bernie to turn and look at her and say, you know what, you are a Republican who called yourself Native-American 30 years ago, but he won't do it. And she -- again, what she is doing here is she's leaning on that crutch of her gender and then she's trying to shiv Bernie Sanders with it, and we see her doing that.  WATTERS: Yes. She's fallen back on the polls, so now she's falling back on her gender. I talked to Frank Luntz who ran the dials on these things --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Fine young man, up-and-comer.  WATTERS: Yes, and great style, too. The Democratic primary viewers, they hate it when these people attack each other. The dials go right down to the basement. So if they are not going to attack each other, like you said, just delays the nomination, they're going to drag this thing out --  GUTFELD: And they are not prepared.  WATTERS: And also, they are not prepared. And to that point, the two biggest dust-ups of the primary so far have been about race and gender, Kamala Harris versus Joe Biden and then this. Donald Trump will destroy that political correctness, identity politics scam. He'll steamroll right through it. So they are not preparing themselves at all for a mano-a-mano match against the president.  WILLIAMS: The Democrats can argue. Hey, you know what, we don't want to go back to clown behavior. We want to go back to normal where you can talk to your kids about the president --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: -- the Democrats wanted Michael Avenatti, right?  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: That's a Democrat argument for this moment. And I think that doesn't require you to say, I'm going to call nicknames and bully.  WATTERS: He can do both, because he's got a lot of accomplishments to run on, Juan. Not just nicknames.  WILLIAMS: By the way, I think Warren is falling in the polls. I don't know that she's desperate. But I think she's got the same supporters in large part as Bernie. And you guys were saying when are they going to fight? And so now, they're fighting.  MCDOWELL: She stole all her ideas from Bernie. She stole all her ideas. How original and strong is that, as a woman.  GUTFELD: She stole her ethnicity. Is that how you say it, an extra syllable?  WATTERS: Ethnicity.  WILLIAMS: By the way, Greg, if you are going to invade, you're not going to -- you're a planet that doesn't have people with orange hair, I would stay away from that.  GUTFELD: That's my point, is that he is a force to be reckoned with. He'll just roll right over that crew, sorry. And I actually like Klobuchar a lot.  WATTERS: We know, Greg. You like Tulsi. You like Klobuchar.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Now he likes Bernie.  GUTFELD: Next up, James Bond producers pushing back against calls to make the character more inclusive?  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WILLIAMS: Big controversy coming out of Hollywood this week. There was outrage over Oscar nominations not being non-inclusive because many of the categories are dominated by males, and now there's this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I admire you a lot, mister?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Bond, James Bond.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: There have been calls for the iconic franchise to include more diversity. And while producers of the movie are open to the idea, there is one line they apparently are not willing to cross. Here I quote, ""he can be of any color, but he is male. I believe we should be creating new characters for women, strong female characters. I'm not particularly interested in taking a male character and having a woman play it. I think women are far more interesting than that."" So Dagen, what do you think? That comes from a woman, Barbara Broccoli, who is one half of the production team.  MCDOWELL: Right, Barbara Broccoli's father, Cubby Broccoli --  WATTERS: Cubby Broccoli? That is an awesome name.  MCDOWELL: They are -- her and her half-brother are the team that have protected the Bond franchise. Her father started it. They protected it. And here's the headline. Bond is a dude. Bond likes chicks. That is the end of it. It's not Jane Bond. It's not Jemimah Bond. It's not June Bond. It's James Bond. OK, Sean Connery is the best and really only James Bond. But let's go back to Goldfinger. He was a trailblazer in terms of really being comfortable in your masculinity. Baby blue romper with a zipper by the pool, boom.  WILLIAMS: Boom, you like it. What do you think?  WATTERS: I think Gutfeld has that outfit.  GUTFELD: I do.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: All right. I don't care if it's a man or woman. I think we are all adults. If the producer, Ms. Broccoli, wants to make James Bond a lady assassination, let her make her a lady assassin. The only people that care about the gender of James Bond are cinematic fundamentalists like Greg Gutfeld who have to stick to the integrity of Ian Fleming's screenplay. And those characters must adhere to the original. It must and how dare not --  GUTFELD: Copout, copout.  WATTERS: -- Or there are those conservative snowflakes who resist any change at all. In my opinion, they want to risk a lot of money and invest a lot of money and spend money to make a new movie like that, it's a big risk. Audience is going to watch it. They maybe won't watch it but it's their money to play with. I'd see it. If they put an athletic, beautiful, sophisticated looking actress, suit her up, you know, with like little gun right here, a little holster down here. And she runs wild in Ukraine, or South Africa, wherever, I'm there with my popcorn.  PERINO: Ukraine.  WATTERS: Yes, Ukraine. A lot of corruption in Ukraine.  WILLIAMS: Yes. So our own female James Bond, Dana Perino.  PERINO: James Bond is a guy.  WATTERS: Yes.  PERINO: It's -- write a new -- if people really want strong characters for women, write the script. Do it. There's like -- there's plenty of like -- there's no shortage of places where you can get movies and shows produced nowadays.  WILLIAMS: That's true. And I think we've had female secret agent --  PERINO: And we also have somebody like Reese Witherspoon who is taking on a lot of new projects, buying books, focusing on women like -- and Big Little Lies was super successful. It can be done.  WILLIAMS: So Greg, what if -- what if let's say, Tarzan was a woman?  GUTFELD: Yes -- I can't even answer that question. Because let me tell you why.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Let me tell you why. Since when is common sense now controversy? The common-sense answer to the question, should James Bond be a woman is no, he's a man. And somehow in this era of peace and prosperity, you have a pocket of unwell activists, right, who have nothing to do, no jobs, and all they do is -- this is what they do all day, I got to get to Twitter, I got to get to Twitter. No, this is misogynist. It's misogynist that James Bond can't be a woman. All right fine. If James Bond, you want him to be a woman, Mary Poppins make her a man, OK? Who else --  WATTERS: Mike Poppins.  GUTFELD: Mike Poppins, right? You know what, I want to male Wonder Woman, all right, a male Wonder Woman.  WATTERS: That's Superman.  GUTFELD: How about a male Mary Magdalene? Let's really mess with things. This -- we're living in a time we're allowing a small fraction of people sounding louder than they really are on social media, and it scares companies, and it scares creative types. I'm on the side of Stephen King, who said you know what art -- he will say art shouldn't be based on diversity but on quality. I would go even further and say everything should be based on quality. If you're a surgeon, if you're an airline pilot, or if you're an artist, you don't -- I don't care what your gender is.  WILLIAMS: Yes, but if that's the case, then you have more diversity because diversity has been proven to increase and improve quality. But the problem is we live in a patriarchy and a white-dominated society.  WATTERS: Juan, Juan --  GUTFELD: This is on you, Jesse. This is on you, Jesse. This is on you, Jesse, because you didn't -- you turn in your male card --  WATTERS: I'm not taking the blame. I want to see Junebug Bond, Greg. Junebug Bond.  GUTFELD: James Bond can be a man, a woman can write James Bond, but you can't be James Bond.  WATTERS: Wait, wait, but it's a fictional character. You can make it anything you want.  GUTFELD: All right, fine. You argue --  MCDOWELL: (INAUDIBLE) biggest hot back of sexist garbage though, the Irishman because they would never ever spend $175 million to put a bunch of old women and de-age them in a movie.  GUTFELD: Good point. They would cast hot young babes in it.  MCDOWELL: Yes.  MCDOWELL: Al Pacino, he's 79 playing 50-year-old. That's ridiculous.  WILLIAMS: Calm, calm, calm. We have another segment. Coming up, Michael Avenatti facing more legal trouble after getting arrested again. This next for you to see on THE FIVE.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WATTERS: The liberal media's favorite lawyer busted again. Attorney Michael Avenatti got arrested this week and is accused of committing new state and federal crimes while he was out on bail. And that's on top of charges he's already facing in California and New York. It's been a long fall from the top for this guy.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  CHRIS CUOMO, CNN HOST: You got lucky tonight. We're back with Attorney Michael Avenatti. He is a main player --  LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, MSNBC HOST: Sitting beside me right now, I'm not going to let you cheat. You have to guess. And hint, his name is Michael Avenatti.  CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC HOST: Look, I think you're doing a hell of a job. I don't think you're in this for money.  STEPHEN COLBERT, COMEDIAN: I have never seen anyone pander to an audience like you just did. How dare you, sir.  MATTHEWS: You're something else. Michael Avenatti, I'd like to meet you sometime over dinner.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you, Michael Cohen.  MICHAEL AVENATTI, LAWYER: Thank you.  DON LEMON, HOST, CNN: Michael Cohen -- Michael --  AVENATTI: Please, whatever you do, don't call me anything other than Michael Cohen.  LEMON: That was good though.  AVENATTI: Not really.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: Well, I think that montage, Greg, perfectly sums up how gullible the media is.  GUTFELD: You know what, it is amazing. They should never live that down. The only network that didn't fall for this was Fox News. But they invested their shallow intelligence into an obvious clown, because he was anti- Trump. And they -- and they and you saw how flowery the compliments we're. And it's a lesson. It actually really isn't the Democrats that are at fault. They're out of power, right? Democrats are out of power so they want to get back in power, they'll do anything. But it's the media who are always in power. They always control the stories, they always push the narratives. And every time they are dead wrong, and we've never known how dead wrong they were in the past until recently. Now we understand how much is fake. And we saw this with Kavanaugh, and we saw this with Covington, and with Avenatti and collusion that this is on the media. They're a bunch of a medic lemmings that copy each other in order to be cool. They're like every dumb teenager that falls for somebody bad and then they try to forget about it, but you can't forget you got to hold them to it. It's the same thing with impeachment. They're all a bunch of liars and losers.  WILLIAMS: Yes.  GUTFELD: And leakers.  WATTERS: And leakers.  GUTFELD: They're liars, they're losers, and leakers. Jeanine Pirro, coming up.  WATTERS: Juan, what about the line from Matthews, you're not in it to make money? That's pretty good, right?  WILLIAMS: But I mean, you guys are falling for Trump. I mean, you know talk about lies.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: Is Trump in jail?  GUTFELD: I think he's achieving, Juan. He's doing good stuff.  WILLIAMS: The reality is the reason we know about Avenatti what, Stormy Daniels. Oh, why is she in the news and why did people then -- why did Stormy Daniels -- and she's the one who got the worst --  GUTFELD: She got screwed by him.  WATTERS: Why did Stormy Daniels fire Avenatti.  WILLIAMS: That's right, because he was defrauding her, she said. But again --  GUTFELD: At least she paid her. Avenatti screwed her and didn't pay her.  WILLIAMS: But I'm just saying, it's Trump who's at -- I don't want to say the bottom, but then he's on top of the story and you somehow avoid Trump as the guy who's brought out --  WATTERS: Let's move on. Let's talk about Avenatti. A lot of financial crimes, Dagen.  MCDOWELL: You just had -- you just had a Jesse moment.  WATTERS: We should have more of those.  MCDOWELL: Which I appreciate. Why is there snidely whiplash radar broken? Why can't they see -- again, they cannot see that the guy is a criminal -- excuse me, an alleged criminal because of their hatred of Trump. They would have satellite trucks outside of the correctional facility where Bernie Madoff is every day. If Bernie Madoff just had some way that he could start tweeting his -- some loathsome comments about President Trump, that's where we are. Some of these crimes are hilarious. It's mail -- it was mail and wire fraud that he's alleged to have conducted after he was arraigned last year.  GUTFELD: And he was going to be the Democratic candidate.  WATTERS: That's right. I think CNN was encouraging him to run.  PERINO: Right. So he's a character and he has energy. But just because someone is a character doesn't mean that they have character.  WATTERS: Ouch.  PERINO: I think this guy has a lot of --  GUTFELD: That was directed at you, Jesse.  PERINO: No, it wasn't.  WATTERS: Looking at me right in the eyes.  PERINO: No, it wasn't. But we were saying in the break like he just basically went from scam to scam.  WATTERS: Right.  PERINO: And he was basically -- he was scamming everybody along the way so it was not only that his clients, but then he was trying to scam Nike, which is how he got involved in this problem. And then he's like moving money around like a gambler.  WATTERS: Yes, and all the bottom just fell out. Sorry, Michael. ""FASTEST SEVEN"" is coming up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  MCDOWELL: Welcome back. Time for the ""FASTEST SEVEN."" First up, is President Trump on to something with this attack on government regulations?  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Turn on the water. Drip, drip, drip. I call the guy, is something wrong with this? No, sir, it's just the restrictor. So you're in there five times longer than you're supposed to be.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  MCDOWELL: Showers dripping, dishwasher is not working well, toilets not having enough water for a good flush. Greg, he's a hotel --  GUTFELD: There have been worse than the drip. Trump is our nation's cab driver, right? He is closer to the street than Bruce Springsteen because he spent his life dealing with construction workers going out and talking to them, and also casinos. You can't get more strict than that unless you join the Westies. And I don't think - he might even be in the Westies. I'm not sure. But I like the fact that you know, people mock him over this. But he cares about stuff that people care about.  MCDOWELL: Absolutely.  PERINO: I mean, OK, we have this dishwasher. Two hours and 40 minutes it's what it says that it's going to take --  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: And it's loud, and then it drives you -- it drives me crazy. So when he said this, I was absolutely -- but the reason he said it is because they're working on regulations that would make it better.  WATTERS: And why? Thanks, Obama. The Obama Department of Energy slap more regulations on household appliances than any other administration.  GUTFELD: Barack Hussein Obama.  WATTERS: And it used to take on average an hour to do one cycle in a dishwasher, now it's two hours. So the President is trying to go back to one.  WILLIAMS: Yes, I think I've heard this before from the right. I think it was drill, baby drill. And this is --  PERINO: Thank goodness, now we're energy independent.  GUTFELD: We don't need the Middle East.  WILLIAMS: And this is -- this is real life rage. This is people who don't like innovation, don't like change. You know what Trump's complaint was? Oh, those light bulbs make me look orange. What is -- I mean, what is going on here? This is just --  GUTFELD: Juan, you have -- Juan, you hate everything he does.  WILLIAMS: No, I don't. You brought it up. You said, this is what Trump is saying at a rally at -- was it in Wisconsin, Dagen?  GUTFELD: He speaks -- he speaks how Americans think and that's important.  WATTERS: You don't look good on that lighting, Juan. Incandescent light bulbs make you look good. Those other ones make you look like you're on like a hospital hallway. It's not sexy.  WILLIAMS: Look, I tell you what --  GUTFELD: Why don't we have those lights here?  WILLIAMS: Not sexy. Well, I tell you what, that's different lightbulbs, but it's not the light bulbs. It's up to you to get the right lightbulb, but it's not to say we shouldn't innovate and we shouldn't have more energy- efficient lightbulbs.  WATTERS: Let's innovate to make things better.  WILLIAMS: That's what I'm saying.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: Check into his hotel. Go to the shower. It feels like someone is crying on my head.  WILLIAMS: Oh my God.  WATTERS: I mean, I want to get like --  GUTFELD: I like that feeling.  WATTERS: I want to get like a -- like a -- like a fire engine hose level of water pressure on this hair.  GUTFELD: Everybody cries on my head.  WILLIAMS: Go to Ritz Carlton and forget, you know, Motel 6. That's what your problem.  MCDOWELL: Trump has moments that make everybody go, yes. Next up, somebody who doesn't do that. Adam Schiff suffering an embarrassing moment and no, it's not about impeachment.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: U.S. representatives for 12.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: 153rd of California's House delegation is this Intelligence Committee Chairman. His name is Adam Schiff.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: Also would have accepted pencil neck.  GUTFELD: It would have been great if they said Tom Shillue. But you got to understand, this is really healthy. It's really good. And maybe a bad sign for Democrats. No one is paying attention to your clowns, but it speaks to the success of America that politics plays a really small part in their lives.  WATTERS: Yes. I held pictures of them out in the streets of New York. No one knows who he is, not even the smart people.  WILLIAMS: I think we did this segment before and it was Michael Avenatti. Is that right?  GUTFELD: Yes.  WILLIAMS: But I mean, if you put up a picture of John Roberts, not Fox's John Roberts, the Chief Justice. I don't think most people recognize him. I think he put up Mitch McConnell. But again, you just delight in trying to make fun of a man that the President mocks as pencil neck.  WATTERS: No, if they put a picture of Greg, I bet nine out of 10 people know.  PERINO: I would say that the Jeopardy contestants are not street smart but they know a lot of obscure things.  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: They just don't know Adam Schiff.  MCDOWELL: And he's so obscure that they don't even know him. Thank you. Here is a way finally to keep your pooch calm while you're at work. Spotify just launched a playlist for dogs left home alone. It's aimed at alleviating stress. Dana, you play --  PERINO: Well, I tweeted this morning, because I love this idea. I think it's smart. Everybody loves dogs -- loves their dogs. Animals are great and all that. And then I met all day to go back because Peter had listed a whole bunch of songs that he thought should be on this playlist and it was just off the top of his head and I meant to go back and get them because they were very funny. And instead, I just talked about impeachment all day. I'm sorry to disappoint him there.  GUTFELD: Well, let me -- I like this. I think you should get a new woofer though. Because you got to put the spot in Spotify. Hey look, the best thing about this is you got to be careful of the songs you pick, right? You can't get like Aerosmith Walk This Way Because all the dogs keep hearing his walk, walk. You can't do like Walking on Sunshine or beach house, walk -- you know Walk in the Park because the dog is going to be hearing walk. Right now, I bet their dogs at home right now, walk, walk, park, park. I bet their dogs are going crazy right now.  WATTERS: Johnny just got me an Alexa for the apartment and --  PERINO: Why did you get that?  WILLIAMS: I love it.  WATTERS: It was a gift, Dana.  PERINO: You shouldn't get that.  WATTERS: Why? Now, I can play songs for Rookie.  PERINO: Have you not paid attention to all of these things?  WATTERS: They're spying on me? Let them see.  WILLIAMS: Exactly. Let them go.  WATTERS: I have nothing to hide.  GUTFELD: Oh, you do. You have a lot to hide.  WILLIAMS: You know what, this is -- this is like people who think their dog loves them, right? Now they think they know exactly what music the dog likes. This is a fantasy. But it's OK. You know, I mean, we make up songs about ""Ain't Nothing But a Hound Dog"" and all that, fine. But I mean, this -- do you think that you are inside your dog's mind?  PERINO: It makes the owner -- this is not for the dog, it's for the owner to feel better.  WILLIAMS: Yes, that's exactly right. I agree.  MCDOWELL: My dog only likes me because well, I smell like food because I spill on myself. ""ONE MORE THING"" next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PERINO: It's time now for ""ONE MORE THING,"" Jesse.  WATTERS: All right. An installment of Jesse's unsolved mysteries. Very spooky. All right, here's a photo of the night sky in Navajo County, Arizona. Look at that. That's real. That's like an X file situation. Now, what could it be? Do you guys have a guess? Anyone want to take a guess?  GUTFELD: It's the spirit of Prince.  WATTERS: Close. Purple haze caused by LED lights from a nearby illegal marijuana farm. All right.  GUTFELD: There you go.  WATTERS: And I think that's true. Also, I'm on the ""QUIZ SHOW"" Fox Nation with Tom Shillue AKA Adam Schiff. So go there and check that out. You're going to have to tune in.  PERINO: You're going to have to tune and find out. All right, Greg.  GUTFELD: Can we ban in tune in? Anyway, OK, let's do this. Greg's angry. Yes, there's a surprise. All right, last summer, I was going crazy because there were all these outbreaks of vaping illnesses. And the way the news was presenting it was so bogus. They're blaming it on these honest vaping businesses, instead of the substances that were illegal that were being put into the vapes. Now the CDC, a new report admits that it's the illegal substances and not the actual vapors, the vaping that was the problem. Think about this. Think about all those businesses that were ruined by this -- the way the news covered this, and how Jewel got screwed, not the singer, but the company, and it's not even their fault. And then the news just goes on, and they don't even report this stuff. You don't report this at all. And it's like --  PERINO: And they got the President involved.  GUTFELD: They got the President involved, and they're passing legislation. They're trying to ban this stuff.  WILLIAMS: They're trying to take away my mango bubble gum.  GUTFELD: Yes, it's wrong. You know, vaping is saving people's lives. It's getting them off cigarettes. Yes, it's saving people's lives. People who smoke don't smoke anymore and they don't get the tar. And that's garbage. This is wrong and it's on the media again getting a big story wrong and they never have to pay for it.  WILLIAMS: Yes, getting kids addicted to nicotine.  GUTFELD: Oh please, that is the dumbest opinion ever.  MCDOWELL: Blood cancer is better.  WILLIAMS: Blood cancer is better.  PERINO: This is ""ONE MORE THING,"" it should be fun. All right there was traffic in Middlebury, Vermont that doesn't happen very often but it came to a standstill and you'll never guess what happened. Watch this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How do you not know this?  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: So this guy had his tractor-trailer full of cattle and he didn't know that the back gate came open and all the cows out and he kept driving because he didn't know.  GUTFELD: Breaking move.  WATTERS: Move, out of the way.  PERINO: I mean, it's utterly this --  GUTFELD: Oh, terrible (INAUDIBLE) for all of us.  PERINO: I will be -- tell you, I have a new podcast. I'll tell you what. It's pretty funny. It's about a Lentil Walnut Burgers, but also impeachment, and Democrats, and debates, and things like that. All right, Juan.  WILLIAMS: All right. So there's the Green New Deal, there is Green Day, and now green puppy. Yes, take a look at this puppy. He was born last Friday, North Carolina. The dog's owner, Shana Stamey, said that her White Shepherd gave birth to eight puppies, everything great until the fourth puppy was born covered in lime green fur.  The veterinarian says the color was caused by the mother's bodily fluid. Luckily, it's fading. The dog has a fitting name for a giant green Hulk. The Hulk.  WATTERS: I think these kids put a highlighter to it.  PERINO: All right, Dagen, I'm going to talk about that after -- go ahead.  MCDOWELL: Yes, he didn't go to the details of that fluids so I appreciate that. Well, this is what I do when I hear Beyonce. Take a look. That's all I got. That's Riptide, the Retriever. That's shared by humor and animals back and watch that over and over again.  PERINO: He has a good -- a good Twitter.  WILLIAMS: Yes, he's great.  PERINO: Twitter system or something. You know, obviously, I can't talk with as many hours a day. We're going to have to address this as impeachment goes on and on and on. But we'll be back tomorrow. Set your DVRs.

104,FOX,"Pelosi signs articles, names trial managers; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" January 15, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Welcome to Washington. I am Bret Baier. This is Fox News coverage of the impeachment of President Donald Trump. Coming up momentarily, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi holds what is called an engrossment ceremony. Earlier today, the House voted to send articles of impeachment to the U.S. Senate for a trial. This evening, clerk of the House, Cheryl Johnson, signs that paperwork officially, and then there will be an actual procession, part of which you will see on camera as the House parades the articles of impeachment over to the U.S. Senates. House sergeant at arms, Paul Irving, leading the way, the paperwork, escorted in blue folders, walked through statuary hall and the capitol rotunda to the secretary of the Senate Julie Adams, all very formal. We haven't seen it since 1998. We will show you that event live and talk about what is happening with the impeachment and where we go from here. You are looking live in the House, waiting to see House Speaker Nancy Pelosi show up there. Chad Pergram is our congressional correspondent. He is on Capitol Hill tonight with setting the scene for this formal event. Chad?  CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, as you say, we haven't something like this in quite a while. But this is where House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the impeachment managers and Cheryl Johnson, who is the clerk of the House, will get together. We will see as the Speaker takes some questions. Once they start, I'm told, that that ceremony will take about 15 minutes. They will then disappear for a bit and they will actually sign the paperwork and formalize it off stage. And then you will have the procession where Paul Irving, you might know him. He always announces the president when they have state of the union, Mr. Speaker, the president of United States. He will then escort Cheryl Johnson across the capital. Across the building, Mike Stinger, who is Irving's opposite number. He is the Senate sergeant at arms. He will pick yup the procession. And he will escort Cheryl Johnson, the clerk of the House, to Julie Adams, her opposite number, the secretary of the Senate or Adams designee. And we will actually -- maybe see them go into the Senate chamber. This is basically where they're saying this is what we have done in the House. We've impeached the president. We're alerting you. Some time later tonight, the Senate prospectively will send a message back to the House and say what you got. And then tomorrow, we will do this all over again where they will actually take the articles of impeachment plus the impeachment managers, the seven prosecutors who were announced today by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. They will present them to the Senate and they will actually, you know, read the articles aloud before the Senate. Now, I'm told that that probably won't happen tomorrow before about 12:45, 1 o'clock. And they will also probably bring over the U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts. He'll come across the street. He will be -- administer the oath of office, and then they will swear in the senators as jurors, Bret.  BAIER: Chad, you know, the president obviously has called all of this a hoax. Republicans say there really is not a case here. Democrats say they will make that case. The announcement of seven House managers today by the Speaker, and she also hit tones of the Constitution, pointing back to the founding fathers, making this a big moment, she said, for all of our children.  PERGRAM: Right. And this is where Democrats have tried to make this case and say this is about the future. This is about future presidents. She often invokes the children, whether she's talking about healthcare or the Constitution. And the chair of the Judiciary Committee, Jerry Nadler, who will be one of those managers, you know, he talked about that the Senate is actually on trial here too, Bret.  BAIER: All right. Chad Pergram on the Hill, we will head back as all of this gets underway. Let's bring in Martha MacCallum, host of The Story, my co-host for political coverage, the Story obviously weeknights seven eastern here of Fox. Thought as we get this formal process underway, we talked a lot about today that this is all a foregone conclusion, but there is still this formality that, again, we have not seen since 1998.  MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: There is. And I think, you know, the formality of this moment is sort of what Nancy Pelosi has control over at this point to make sure that this is -- has the kind of momentum and has the kind of weight that she wants to give to all of this in the face of the fact that it has turned out to be a very partisan exercise, which is something that she said from the very beginning she didn't want to see. She said that impeachment was too divisive, an effort should take up unless there was an overwhelming case and bipartisan buy in and commitment to agreement on it. And she never did get that. We will always look back and wonder whether or not she was pushed into this. I think she will always consider whether or not she made the right decision here to move this forward. When it gets to the Senate, obviously she's going to meet with the -- senators but the big question now is this issue of witnesses, which is also being nudged a bit by the new evidence that has come forward and these very sort of, you know, ominous notes from -- and discussions about packages being delivered and surveillance of the Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch to Ukraine. There is a lot here in terms of fodder for the president's opponents to dig into right now. And whether that sways a 4th Republican senator to decide that they do want witnesses here is really one of the big questions tonight as we watch all of this begin, Bret.  BAIER: Martha, do you think that there is a level of concern at the White House about that prospect of witnesses in a Senate trial as we get ready to -- officially the articles heading over there and Mitchell McConnell taking the reigns of how this process goes?  MACCALLUM: I can't imagine that there isn't. We -- they obviously had a big day today signing the first phase of this China trade agreement. The president was feeling obviously very confident about all of that. The USMCA is also on deck to be passed as well. And that is a very big achievement for this president. There's no doubt about that. But he has said very clearly that he thinks impeachment is an ugly word, that he didn't want to be impeached, and Nancy Pelosi has tried to kind of, you know, hammer that nail in by saying that no matter what happens with this process the House of Representatives has impeached the president. And that is a forever sort of, you know, sign around his neck or an asterisk to his presidency. So I -- my guess is that there has to be some consternation about whether or not you're going to see a moment when John Bolton primarily sits down at that table and gives his take on all of this.  BAIER: Martha, stand by if you would. Let's talk now with Harold Ford Jr., former Democratic Congressman from Tennessee. Harold, your thoughts on this day, Republicans will say they are concerned that this opens the door to more partisan impeachments for other presidents down the road. Democrats say they are making a case that they think is open and shut.  HAROLD FORD JR. FOX NEWS POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR: I remember 20 years ago, Bret. I was in the Congress. I voted against impeaching President Clinton. And I remember the pageantry that we're about to watch or we're anticipating here in the next few minutes with Speaker Pelosi. It was a different Speaker and different Congress. The Senate now has a responsibility. You have to hope that both Democrats and Republicans will take their pledge to be impartial in a very serious way. Although there is a foregone conclusion that he will be acquitted, I think all of the jurors have to be willing to listen. But if you are on the political team with President Trump this evening, you think how big of a moment this is from a positive standpoint, the jobs numbers, the economic numbers, the phase 1 of the China deal, the USMCA agreement, the incredible effort in Iran, the killing of this general. Any other person would be riding so high. But all of this news does put a damper here. As it goes to the Senate, Bret, I hope Democrats do one thing, that they focus solely on the national security implications of the president's actions. Whether he is convicted or not, I think going forward -- if we take anything from this in terms of a history lesson, it would be that no president should take any actions that would undermine national security in an effort to advance their own political interest. Now, whether this president has done that or not, he's almost admitted to some of that. So whatever Democrats do, whatever the managers do, and I think Speaker Pelosi did a really good job at some of these choices for managers, including this young guy, Jason Crow and Hakim Jeffries. These two young men, Jeffries and Crow, Crow a former army ranger and intelligence analyst. They are uniquely equipped to do this. So this is an interesting -- historic in a lot of ways, unfortunate for the country, but all these parties involved, House members -- Senate now has a role to play. And I hope they -- all Democrats and Republicans take it seriously.  BAIER: Seven House managers, 13 House managers last time for the Clinton impeachment. Stand by if you would. Andy McCarthy, former U.S. attorney to the southern district of New York. Andy, we spent a lot of time -- the gavel to gavel coverage of the House as they built the case. That's how it is supposed to go. Democrats said that they had to rush through that urgently because the president was a threat to the election in 2020 by his actions. Now there was this pause for 27 days. And we are waiting for the formal move over for the articles of impeachment, your thought?  ANDY MCCARTHY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, Bret, I think the delay obviously undermines the alleged urgency that was behind the effort in the first place. But my main concern, if I were leader McConnell and the Republicans in the Senate would be that this is not an open and shut case in the sense that the Democrats are saying it is shut. In fact, they are continuing their investigation. And as we have been discussing, they are throwing, not only this new evidence, but the prospect of perhaps more impeachment articles. Perhaps more witnesses who are just emerging coming forward. And my beef is that no federal judge would put up a situation -- a trial judge where he was being asked to try a defendant in a case, and at the same the prosecutors were continuing in the grand jury to investigate the defendant on the same charges and broadcasting whatever evidence they find to the media which, of course, would prejudice the trial. So I would certainly hope that McConnell will at least -- and the Republicans will at least entertain the thought of suspending this without prejudice and telling the House we're only going to try this case once. Let's try it when it's ready. It doesn't appear to be ready.  BAIER: Andy, what about this new evidence the Democrats, the House Intelligence Committee sent over. It includes documents from Lev Parnas, the indicted associate of Rudy Giuliani, the president's lawyer, some communications, text messages. It seems like there is evidence that the Ambassador Yovanovitch followed, tracked by some of these men. How does that factor in now? Obviously, it was not part of the case the House Democrats built in these various hearings, but it now heads over to the Senate.  MCCARTHY: Well, it's always obviously been a problem, Bret, though, because there's clear factual overlap between the indicted charges in the southern district of New York and the facts that were uncovered and the information that was uncovered in the House proceedings. To the point where a big part of the southern district case is what happened with Marie Yovanovitch, the ambassador to Ukraine, and her removal at the behest of Rudy Giuliani and some of his associates. That was a big part of the House proceedings. It's a big part of the southern district trial. The other wildcard here is I think it's pretty clear that Parnas is trying to leverage his potential importance as a witness in the impeachment trial in whatever plea negotiations he must be having with the southern district of New York. He obviously wants immunity, because if he testified in the impeachment case that would convict him more than likely in the criminal proceeding. I worked in the southern district of New York for 20 years. They don't give immunity. What they generally demand is that you plead guilty to the chargers and give full cooperation. So that may take some time to work out.  BAIER: You're looking live there, the articles of impeachment on the table. We're waiting for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Andy, stand by, cast of THE FIVE standing by in New York. This is their hour on Fox News channel. It's here from Dana Perino and Juan Williams, Dana, your thoughts first.  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Well, I think that after this initial pomp and circumstance everybody should just settle in, because it could be possibly a long time. We're talking about possibly two weeks. There won't be a lot of new information. I see that the Speaker is probably getting ready here to appear. The senators can't really engage, and America feels like it's already heard all this. They heard it a month ago. Public opinion did not change either way. And I think that when either side gets frustrated, that the American people don't see it their way. They are missing the fact that if there was some big obvious case against the president, we would all know it. It would be really obvious. The fact that it's this muddled at this point and people are dug in, I think that means that you won't see a lot of movement. Plus, I would also add this. You have not yet seen the president's lawyers have a chance to layout their case. It's an impressive group of people. And they will be up against many of the people in the House that we know, some that we don't. And so that might be worth tuning into.  BAIER: Yeah. You're looking live at the Rayburn Room, by the way. And the House and all the reporters getting up to take a look at the articles of impeachment, they're on the table. They will be signed and then walked over, as we've mentioned, from the House to the Senate through the rotunda. Juan Williams, Republicans will say that the process in the House was faulty. They didn't have a chance to make a defense, a legitimate defense, as Dana points out. The president's attorneys and his team will in the Senate, your thoughts today?  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Well, they are going to have an extensive opportunity. And I think they have got quite a team there. Pat Cipollone, Jay Sekulow, I think Sekulow will be on TV most nights. I think he's TV able. And on the other side, I think when you look at people like Jerry Nadler, I think Nadler knows it, has the command of the case. But I think the star there is going to be Adam Schiff. And Schiff, again, I think, you know, sort of TV ready. And I think part of this is public sentiment and building public support. And on that point, Bret, I think it's important to note that people are who critical of Nancy Pelosi for the 27 day delay are now going to have to deal with the fact that there is, as you've mentioned, new information continuing to come in as well as the possibility of the former national security adviser, John Bolton, agreeing or responding to a subpoena to testify. So all of that means that we have a changing dynamic, and it puts pressure on this political process. This is not a criminal trial. This is a political process. And from Pelosi's point of view, it puts pressure on a lot of the sort of moderate Republicans who are in some political peril to come along and support the idea of witnesses and documents. And this is an ongoing effort, not something that is to be viewed as static and having been already settled and discussed in terms of the existing articles of impeachment.  BAIER: Chad Pergram, again, our congressional correspondent, announced today House Speaker Pelosi saying that she is appointing seven House managers. As we look at those seven, some are familiar names from the process, and the committee hearing process, including Adam Schiff and Jerry Nadler. But what about the others on here, and any surprises as far as who has been named to make this case in the Senate?  PERGRAM: It's not a surprise that they picked a couple of freshmen. Sylvia Garcia of Texas and also Jason Crow of Colorado, you know, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is very aware of this big freshman class. The majority makers, those that, you know, you know, propelled the Democrats to the majority. So she wants to respect that. It did not have older members. That's one criticism of the Democratic leadership had faced. And of the criticisms about her leadership, you know, she had a bit of a rocky, you know, time last foul. Some people thought she not have the votes to be the Speaker of the House. So this is going to be a very different group in that sense. I think it isn't going to be Jerry Nadler, the chair of the Judiciary Committee, who will be the lead manager here. In 1999, it was Henry Hyde of Illinois who was the chair of the Judiciary Committee, who led the effort against President Clinton. It's going to be Adam Schiff. And I should note that this is not Adam Schiff's first rodeo. He was the impeachment leader that Nancy Pelosi appointed him for a lower profile impeachment trial before the Senate in 2010. Thomas Porteous was a federal judge who was impeached. And that effort impressed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. And that's why, you know, she put him in charge of the intelligence committee and now has asked him to lead the charge today. One other thing I should say, Bret, here is that the impeachment managers were all just told about 24 hours ago. They have been meeting in the basement of the capitol kind of plotting strategy, trying to figure out how they're going to go about this. If there's going to be 24 hours of debate and 7 managers, that's a lot of time that each of these manager would have, as you subdivide their time, presenting to the Senate.  BAIER: Yeah. Martha MacCallum, there is also the factor of the timing in the Senate trial. As these articles of impeachment move over there, it starts this process. But we don't know how long this could go. Dana mentioned it could go a long time. And if witnesses are in fact called -- and there you see Nancy Pelosi making her way to the Rayburn Room, it could be a big, big moment here especially for some of those candidates who are on the campaign trail.  MACCALLUM: Absolutely. You know, there's -- those senators who are running for the nomination have a lot at stake here in terms of the time frame and how much of that time gets eaten up by being in this trial. Then the other senators that we talked about before -- Republican senators who are in precarious electoral positions going into 2020. You know it's been said, but it's worth reiterating that if Democrats sort of lose this round on impeaching the president, there is another big round here for them. And that is the potential of flipping the Senate. Having it turn to a Democrat majority Senate, which would essentially -- if the president does win re-election tie his hands in the second term, Bret.  BAIER: Yeah. As we look live at the Rayburn Room in the House, Nancy Pelosi surrounded by her committee chairs making their way into the room packed with press. Again, the formal signing of the articles of impeachment, the House clerk will do that formally. There you see Adam Schiff, Jerry Nadler and others, the Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.  NANCY PELOSI, HOUSE SPEAKER: Good afternoon. As you know, on December 18th, the House of Representatives upheld its constitutional duty and voted articles of impeachment against the president of the United States, Donald Trump. He said in the course of the debate that he did not uphold his oath of office to defend the Constitution of the United States. The president takes a special oath, a little different from the congressional oath. In fact, he takes an oath that was taken by President George Washington, the patriarch of our country, in front of whose picture we stand here. It's so sad, so tragic for our country that the actions taken the president to undermine our national security, to violate his oath of office, and to jeopardize the security of our elections, the integrity of our elections has taken us to this place. So today, we will make history. When we walk down -- when the managers walk down the hall -- across the threshold in history, delivering articles of impeachment against the president of the United States for abuse of power and obstruction of the House. Making that history we are making progress for the American people, progress in support of our Constitution, progress in honor of the sacrifice and divisions of our founders. Progress and honor of the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform, and progress for the future of our children, make it be very clear that this president will be held accountable. That no one is above the law, and that no future president should ever entertain the idea that Article One -- Article 2 says that he can do whatever he wants. And so with that, I will sign the resolution transmitting the articles of impeachment to the Senate, which will be delivered by our managers, of whom I'm very proud. When they bring this over, it will set in motion a process on the Senate side. Probably tomorrow, I don't know their schedule. But it may be as soon as tomorrow. The senators will take an oath of office. They will take a special oath of office to do impartial judges and to impartial justice according to the Constitution and the laws. Let's hope that they uphold that oath that they take tomorrow. And so now, I'm very honored to be here with our 6th chairman who worked so hard to help us uphold the Constitution with their legislating, their investigating, their litigating. You know the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee is part of the managers, Jerry Nadler, Mr. Schiff, the distinguished Chairman of the Intelligence -- House Select committee on Intelligence. Congresswoman Maxine Waters, the chair of National Services Committee, congresswoman -- madam chair of the Oversight Committee. Congressman -- Mr. Chairman Eliot Engel of the Foreign Affairs Committee and -- Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, we thank them for all of their difficult work. And we honor our darling, Elijah Cummings, who said one day when we are dancing with the angels, what we will say about what we did at this difficult time in our country's history? And then I am very proud that Mr. Nadler and Mr. Schiff are part of our managers. But I want to acknowledge other managers who are with us. A freshman member but I shouldn't say freshman. They have been here one year, accomplished great things. Congressman Jason Crow from Colorado, Congresswoman Val Demings of the state of Florida. Congresswoman Garcia of Texas -- are we all here? Where is Hakim Jeffries of New York? Is that everybody? And -- this is who served the impeachment. She was -- the Nixon impeachment, she was a staffer for the Judiciary Committee member Don Edwards of California. She was member of the Judiciary Committee in the Clinton impeachment, and her own right a member of the Judiciary Committee and now member of the Judiciary Chair -- House administration which oversees elections and a manager. And with that, I thank them all for their leadership and their service. And I am now going to proceed to sign the articles.  BAIER: Speaker Nancy Pelosi surrounded by seven House impeachment managers that will make the case in the U.S. Senate in the trial and six committee chairs who dealt with the committee's hearings that led to the articles of impeachment, abuse of power of President Trump, and obstruction of the House, Speaker Pelosi now signing these articles of impeachment as they will make their way over formally. Bring back Dana Perino and Juan Williams. Dana, the House Speaker today said this is not political. This is not partisan. This is about patriotism. But frankly, it is political and it is partisan. And it's just the process that we have witnessed over the past weeks.  PERINO: I think one of the most partisan comments that she had was -- happened over the weekend when she was on the Sunday show on ABC, in which she said that regardless of what happens in the Senate and being faced with the fact that we already read the end of the book, we know that the president will be acquitted. And so now, we are being forced to go back and read single every word for our punishment, for having skipped ahead and read the end of the book. But she said the president has already impeached, and he will have that for the rest of history, as if that was the goal. And I think right now what you're seeing is this ceremony. And it seems very sombre, but that's very different from the House process which was quite chaotic. And I think when it goes over to the Senate, people will see that Mitchell McConnell will run a process, a trial that will be very senatorial. It will be calmer and more sterile. And it will be more slow than anybody wants. And we will have to go through this because this got going back in September, or if you look at what president has said they have talked about impeaching him from the very beginning. The other thing I would say is that Senators Collins and Murkowski, the two Republican women who Senator Schumer basically is doing is polling in their states to see if they are vulnerable in 2020. I do not think that those two women will be bullied into voting for witnesses unless they really think it's meritorious. But you'll start to see a lot more 2020 activity, including you'll see three of the senators who are on the debate stage last night for the Democrats. They will be in the Senate having to be jurors in this trial and they're not allowed to say anything during that time. So it will be interesting. But I do think it will be a much calmer process than what you saw in the House.  BAIER: Juan, what about that prospect? There is also Democrats up for re- election like Doug Jones in deep red Alabama -- will have to make a decision as well.  WILLIAMS: I do. I think that this is a political process. I mean, I don't think there is any getting away from that, Bret. And the difference is the way that we frame it as Republicans and Democrats. Republicans clearly are intent on saying this is a partisan act. The president has said as much.  (CROSSTALK)  BAIER: Let me break in here for a second, Juan. Sorry. OK, passing out the pens, getting it ready to walk over to the Senate side. Sorry to interrupt. Go ahead.  WILLIAMS: Not at all. I think while Republicans have sought to frame this as a partisan act, I think from -- what you just saw from Nancy Pelosi is her on emphasis on the idea that there are people of conviction and principle standing up as patriots. I think that's why she spoke about the idea that this doesn't happen everyday, that you have the Constitution, the founding fathers, the people serving in our military, and our children all looking over our shoulder. That's a very different way to look at this. And I think that what she is saying is -- and again, this comes back to what Dana was saying that -- to both sides we both know that this does not happen to every president. This is a real mark against a president, even if he or she is to be acquitted, and acquittal is likely. And finally, when she spoke of the Senate, she spoke of them taking an oath to do impartial justice. And she said she hoped they would uphold that oath. I think that's very strong language. And again, framing it in the sense of putting the pressure, the onus on Republicans, to look at the evidence, to hear from witnesses -- even the new evidence as we've been discussing here on Fox that's came out in the last 24 hours.  BAIER: All right. Juan and Dana, thank you. We will head your way after this ceremony is completed. We will toss it over to THE FIVE. Thank you. Andy McCarthy, both sides, Republicans and Democrats, pointing to the founders and what they said about the impeachment today, House Speaker Pelosi saying that the founders did not want a ruler, a king, and noted that -- Republicans pointing to federalist 65 and Hamilton what he wrote about partisanship and concern that this could be a process that happens again and again and again if it is just on a partisan basis. Thoughts on that as we watch this walkover from the House to the Senate.  MCCARTHY: I think what's to be very concerned about with that, Bret, is that impeachment is a vital part of the Constitution. Madison thought it was indispensable, as he said during the debates over the Constitution, because it was necessary as kind of a final measure to wrestle or grapple on the -- on the congressional side with potential presidential excess or misconduct. And the problem with impeachment becoming politicized is not just the spectacle that we're seeing but also the fact that it cheapens the impeachment remedy. So we may be heading into an era where we see impeachment much more regularly because it's now going to be used as a political weapon, but that also degrades it because no one will take it as seriously anymore as it's really meant to be taken. It's supposed to be really the nuclear option in our Constitution.  BAIER: All right, Andy, standby. You're looking live right here from the Capitol rotunda looking towards the House chamber, those the doors to the House chamber. And what you're going to see this engrossment ceremony, it's not the best name for this. We'll bring in Chad Pergram. But it is the ceremony to take the actual articles of impeachment and walk them physically which is part of the deal over to the U.S. Senate. And Chad Pergram, we are going to see this pomp and circumstance from chamber to chamber here.  PERGRAM: That's right. We're going to see it twice in the next couple of days. So what's going on right now behind the scenes by the Democratic cloakroom, which is kind of the dugout for the House floor, between the Rayburn Room where they were actually conducting this ceremony, is Cheryl Johnson who is the clerk of House. She is actually putting pen to paper here. You might have seen how Speaker Nancy Pelosi signing her name, signing this message to the Senate with a series of pens that so all the committee chairs and also all the impeachment managers kind of have a souvenir that they would take with them. They do that when they enroll a bill and send it to the President, all the main sponsors get a pen. Well, the same case here. And you're looking toward the House doors. This is what we call the Will Rogers era. You often see us doing live shots or live interviews on our network and others with members of Congress. They will then walk that into Statuary Hall. Statuary Hall is the Old House chamber. Then they will go past the Speaker's office, Paul Irving, the House Sergeant at Arms. He's in charge of security at the Capitol. He will escort Cheryl Johnson, the clerk of the House, with those -- that message in blue folders through the Capitol rotunda, that's the middle of the building, actually then passed the old Senate chamber and then pass the Office of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. On the Senate side of the Capitol, they'll be met by Mike Stenger. He is the Senate Sergeant at Arms and they will actually take the Articles of Impeachment -- or excuse me, take this message alerting the Senate what the House is done into the chamber. And I'm looking right now at the Senate floor, they are kind of in a posture, a holding pattern right now waiting for the House to bring those over. Chuck Grassley is the President Pro Tem, the most senior member of the majority party and he is presiding, waiting for this message to be received in the Senate. And then again, tomorrow is when we do this all again and the actual articles of impeachment plus the manager show up in the Senate in a very similar fashion, Brett.  BAIER: OK, getting ready to see this movement. People at home may say why is this important? Well, it's only happened three times in the history of our country. Let's listen in, not that there's much to hear, but let's listen in. That's Clerk of the House Cheryl Johnson and House Sergeant at Arms, Paul Irving leading the way. Martha McCallum, your thoughts?  MACCALLUM: Well, you know, I'm just watching them walk through the rotunda here, Bret, and thinking about the fact that, you know, regardless of the fact that this is a really purely partisan exercise here, just based on the votes that we saw. In fact, it's bipartisan only in the fact that you had a couple of Republicans vote against what we're seeing play out here. But the rotunda is a place where, you know, you see so many important ceremonies over the course of history take place. It's Statuary Hall, it's where all of the statues of the founding fathers and other prominent Americans are. It's where we see funerals at times as we see people lie in state. So you know, there is a lot of ceremony here and a lot of weight to what we're seeing -- what we're witnessing. And I was also struck by the fact that Nancy Pelosi said, we will make history and progress for the American people, which I think is an interesting choice of words in terms of progress. I think that Democrats look at this period and wonder if in the election process, you know, people wonder what they accomplished in their time as a majority in the House. And she's characterizing this as progress and we'll see if the American people agree as we enter this really, you know, sort of busy period heading into the primaries here of how the American public will really receive all of this.  BAIER: Speaking of the American public, you can come up to Capitol Hill and make the same walk from the House to the Senate. There's places you can't go but for the walk, they're making with the sergeant at arms you can do, and also the impeachment managers falling behind Adam Schiff and Jerry Nadler leading the way of the impeachment managers. Let's bring in Harold Ford again, former Tennessee Congressman. Politically, Harold, how do you think this falls as some of these polls are kind of upside down in swing states about how impeachment is going, how it's -- how it's working for Democrats?  HAROLD FORD JR., FORMER CONGRESSMAN OF TENNESSEE: It doesn't look on the surface as you look at some of the battleground state polling, that anything move during the hearings before the committee, before the Schiff committee and then before the Nadler Committee. So, it will be interesting to see that now that this has moved as Dana and Juan commented to a different process, probably more sterile and predictable and stale process when you consider how chaotic things were in the House. But I would remind everyone, there's no doubt this is a political exercise because impeachment is, but the facts here are ones that are very serious ones. The allegations are very, very serious. The accusations that the President of the United States called a foreign leader and ask that foreign leader for help in a political contest by investigating someone that he might -- that might be running against him this year.  BAIER: Let me interrupt you here, Harold. Hold on one second.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  CHERYL JOHNSON, CLERK, UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: -- of Donald Trump, President of the United States.  SEN. CHUCK GRASSLEY (R-IA): The message will be received.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  BAIER: Sorry. Chuck Grassley is presiding. He is the President Pro Tem, the longest-serving member in the Senate.

Further that at the hour of 12:00 noon on Thursday, January 16, 2020, the Senate will receive the managers on the part of the House of Representatives in order that they may present an exhibit the Articles of Impeachment against Donald John Trump, President of the United States.

GRASSLEY: Is there any objection? So ordered.  MCCONNELL: As unanimous consent, that the Presiding Officer be authorized to appoint a committee of senators to upon the recommendation of the majority leader and to upon the recommendation of the Democratic leader to escort the Chief Justice into the Senate chamber. Further, as consent, that the Secretary of the Senate may directly to notify the House of Representatives of the time and place fixed for the Senate to proceed upon the impeachment of Donald John Trump in the Senate chamber.  GRASSLEY: Is there any objection? If not, so ordered.  MCCONNELL: As unanimous consent, that access to the Senate when the Senate floor and the Senate chamber galleries during all of the proceedings involving the exhibition of consideration of the Articles of Impeachment against Donald John Trump, President of the United States and all times that the Senate is sitting in trial with the Chief Justice of the United States presiding be in accordance with the allocations and provisions are now sent to the desk and asked that it be printed and the record.  GRASSLEY: Is there objection? If not, so ordered.  MCCONNELL: As unanimous consent, the Senate proceed to the consideration of asterisk 471 submitted earlier today.  GRASSLEY: The clerk will report.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Senate resolution for 71 authorizing the taking of a photograph in the chamber of the United States Senate.  GRASSLEY: Is their objection to proceeding to the consideration? Without objection, then the Senate will proceed.  MCCONNELL: As unanimous consent, the resolution be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action over debate.  GRASSLEY: Without objections, so ordered.  MCCONNELL: Now, Mr. President, for the information all Senators, a few minutes ago, the Senate was notified that the House of Representatives is finally ready to proceed with their articles of impeachment. So by unanimous consent, we have just laid some of the groundwork that will structure the next several days. We've officially invited the House managers to come to the Senate tomorrow at noon to exhibit their Articles of Impeachment. Then later tomorrow afternoon at 2:00 p.m., the Chief Justice of the United States will arrive here in the Senate. He will be sworn in by the President Pro Tem, Senator Grassley, then the Chief Justice will swear on all of us senators, will pledge to rise above the petty factionalism and do justice for our institutions, for our state, and for the nation. And then we will formally notify the White House of our pending trial and summon the president to answer the articles and send his counsel. So the trial will commence in earnest on Tuesday. But first, Mr. President, some important good news for the country. We anticipate the Senate will finish the USMCA tomorrow and send this landmark trade deal to President Trump for his signature, a major victory for the administration, but more importantly, for American families. So let me close with this. This is a difficult time for our country, but this is precisely the kind of time for which the Framers created the Senate. I'm confident this body can rise above short-termism and factional favor and serve the long-term best interest of our nation. We can do this and we must.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  BAIER: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell formally accepting The Articles of Impeachment. The Senate now will start this process a trial and rules of the trial that will be set starting tomorrow at noon. The Justice -- the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, John Roberts will be sworn in to preside over this trial. And the House managers will begin to make their case as of next week on Tuesday, when this trial officially gets underway. The logistics, the pomp, and circumstance of the articles being moved from the House to the Senate has been finished. No matter your ideology, no matter your political party, where you stand on any of this, this is history. It's only happened three times in our country and we have you covered. Please stay tuned to Fox News Channel and this Fox station for continuing coverage of this story. In Washington, I'm Bret Baier. Now here on, Fox News Channel will continue.  JESSE WATERS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANCHOR: Let's toss it over to THE FIVE for their analysis.  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANCHOR: We're going to take it from here, Fox News Alert. Thank you so much, Bret. Welcome to THE FIVE. Breaking news on Capitol Hill. Moments ago, Speaker Nancy Pelosi signing the Articles of Impeachment against President Trump. That move clearing the way for a trial that could start next Tuesday. We're also learning who the house impeachment managers will be. Pelosi breaking House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, and House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler to lead the team prosecuting the president. We know you want to hear from THE FIVE so I'm just going to turn it over to Greg. He's got a few things on his mind.  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Yes. I'm trying to control myself from swearing. That was a fricking ceremony. You have ceremonies to award medals. You have ceremonies at weddings and funerals. This was like a baptism at The Addams Family. Did you notice they had a silver platter for the pens? Everybody got a special party favorite, a little pen to take home. We are paying for those fricking pens and for that platter. And then you see the media taking pictures of the pens. Oh look how special the pens are. That -- what that -- what you saw with that ceremony, they were spackling a turd with gold paint, right? And we're all suckers. We're all suckers for believing this is serious. We know it's a sham. It's -- they say it's historical or it's historic. That's B.S. all right. We know this was an emotional tantrum directed a daddy who won the election and they're mad at daddy. So we have to go through this phony procession. Oh, let's show pictures of the cloakroom. Oh, let's watch them walk down the halls. Oh, this is breaking news. Let's repeat it 25 times over and over again until I want to blow my brains out. Look --  PERINO: You're going to have a great time in the next two weeks.  GUTFELD: If you're a viewer, OK, and you're watching this coverage, here's four things you got to remember. The media controls the narrative OK. Look what happened to THE FIVE, right? You know, we -- they put the money in the jukebox, we got to dance. Number two, the Dems have been -- in the media been working on this for three years. So this isn't a moral cause. This was a political vocation meant to unseat an election. Number three, they don't hate Trump, they hate you. He's a proxy for you because you voted for him. They think you're a bunch of rubs because you didn't listen to the media. This is their revenge. And last but not least, you got to store all that anger. And when this is over, and when they lose, because they will, you got to rub their noses in their loss to the day they retire. Thank you.  PERINO: We have 14 minutes left. Jesse?  WATTERS: Greg, here's a pen for you.  GUTFELD: Thank you. You don't know where I'm going to put this.  PERINO: You can keep it.  GUTFELD: I'm going to D.C.  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: All right.  WATTERS: This is all payback by Hillary Rodham Clinton. She was supposed to win the election and Donald Trump ruined it. So this is revenge. It started with the insurance policy, Trump sniffed it out, fires Comey, Mueller knows the whole time there's no collusion but he lets it hang over the Midterms so the democrats win so they can sort up the impeachment. Bill Barr challenges Mueller to show his cards. He's got nothing so the Democrats panicked. They fired up this fake whistleblower deal, rig a very unfair trial against the president, but they rushed it. If they had gone to court and gotten the testimony they needed and gotten the evidence they needed, that would have been one thing. But they had to get it under the wire before Christmas so Nancy gets this half-baked impeachment, only two articles, no criminal violations. And then she runs into a brick wall in the Senate. And McConnell is like, you know, the teacher where it's like, time's up, everybody. Pencils down. Nancy is still scribbling. She ran out of time.  PERINO: Look at all those pens.  WATTERS: Put the pencils -- put the pen down, Nancy. She's got nothing. This is all designed to discredit Donald Trump for political revenge and because he was a businessman and came in and did a better job than a regular politician, and because the Trump doctrine of America first poses a mortal threat to the Democratic Party. It busted down the blue wall, he outflanks them on trade, on everything else. And at this point, it looks like he's going to restrict immigration. So you have someone who comes in former Democrat, a dealmaker, lives in Manhattan his whole life, ready to make a deal. He agrees with them on infrastructure, on drug prices, on everything. You could have a golden age of bipartisanship, signing ceremonies instead of engrossment ceremonies, pens for everybody, but they don't do that. They spit in the President's face. So you know what he does instead? He goes, I'll do it myself. USMCA papers China deal phase one, kills ISIS Baghdadi. He starts running the table. He's like a guy at the casino. He's got a hot hand and everybody else is winning, because they're all at the roulette table, having drinks having a party, everyone's getting rich, but the Democrats --  GUTFELD: They're playing (INAUDIBLE). They're in the (INAUDIBLE) room and they're losing.  WATTERS: They want to arrest of the guy with a hot hand instead of joining the party, and having everybody get rich and happy. And that's why they're so pathetic.  PERINO: Emily, I don't know how you're going to follow that, but I'll let you do it.  EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: I will not try to follow it - - no, I just want to -- I want to point out that it seems that when it suits the Democrats, this is a trial. And when it doesn't, then oh, no, no, this isn't like anything that we have in the court of law. It's totally separate. It's just politics. And to take this out for a second, and just to illustrate perspective. If we did, in fact, have a trial in normal court of law, and an ongoing, simultaneous trial at the same time was a grand jury proceeding, and there were still evidence been gathered, and you could still add it into the trial, it would be preposterous. That would never happen. And I bring that up to say that as we speak, Nadler says with complete finality and confidence that oh, of course, the Senate will accept this new evidence, this bombshell testimony, everything that has to do with Lev Parnas and more as if it will change the game. And yet with all of the fact-finding mission that the House went through, the urgency, the import, the matter of national security, apparently it wasn't enough for them to get it in a timely fashion, nor was it enough for the four weeks that Nancy Pelosi hung on to these articles for her to have it and tidy it up. So, at any point, this defendant, which is also the President of the United States, might be slammed with an additional article of impeachment, apparently, or more evidence that the Senate is just supposed to take. I find that patently against the Constitution because what we usually stand for and constitutionally is one of due process and a fair procedure that we can depend on. And to me, that's the largest mockery, that's it that's in place right now. And one more quick thing. You know, everyone acts that -- just a reminder that it's Chief Justice Roberts who's in charge moving forward, and that this is his show moving forward.  PERINO: It's supposed to be ceremonial though for him.  COMPAGNO: But he still has -- he has final say over the rules. And the Senate has a short amount of time to get their act together, but it's he who can make game-changing decisions. So it looks -- I mean, we'll see whether he optimizes that role.  PERINO: What do you think about -- you know, so here's the thing. As much as it might annoy everybody, it is happening. So given that it is happening, what do you think about what I was saying with Bret Baier that Mitch McConnell, he's just a creature of the Senate. He loves the Senate. So he's going to make this boring, calm, sterile, and I think about -- what about that tactic rather than making it firing?  GUTFELD: I think -- well, I think it's a great tactic, but I always go back to I'm like a viewer. I'm sitting here just like going -- if it's boring, I'm going to go crazy, if it's exciting, I don't want to watch this. Why is this happening? The answer was last night when you saw the debates. The Democrats and the media realized they can't win with that selection that they had from last night. This is their election replacement supplement. It's their testosterone patch. And the worst part about it is we are paying these people. They're on the clock. And they're indulging this emotional revenge on our dime. Shouldn't that mean that we have a right to save super awful things about them? Aren't we allowed because we're paying them to get something out of it by making fun of them every day and ridiculing them and mocking them, because they deserve it, because they're taking our money and they're spending on this undermining our country?  COMPAGNO: Can we talk about --  WILLIAMS: When people say these nasty things about Republicans, you guys go through the roof?  GUTFELD: I'm OK with it.  WILLIAMS: But I'm just going to say this. I think that it's important that we have just witnessed here on THE FIVE the rage from the right over this impeachment process. But what about the reality that the President tried to use his office to get political dirt on an opponent, and we continue to see evidence coming in that this was taking place in terms of even surveillance of the U.S. Ambassador that potentially was threatening to her life.  GUTFELD: It's part of the job.  WILLIAMS: So to me -- part of the job, that's right. The President of the United States is involved in threatening an American ambassador.  GUTFELD: He wasn't threatening anybody.  WILLIAMS: So you can't say -- you can't say the evidence is weak especially with the track record of Trump obstruction, one of the articles of impeachment.  GUTFELD: Oh, now obstruction.  WILLIAMS: And the fact that he was saying people don't testify -- don't testify, don't send the documents over. If he's so innocent, aren't you curious? Why not just have people testify? Why not put it on the table?  GUTFELD: If he's guilty, why is he acting like an innocent person?  WILLIAMS: Innocent person? An innocent person says let everyone testify. Here's the proof.  GUTFELD: That certainly helped in this process.  WATTERS: Juan, if you're accused of a crime, you're not taking the stand. You know what I mean?  WILLIAMS: Oh, no.  WATTERS: You put up a good defense. And in this country, you're innocent until proven guilty.  WILLIAMS: I think Bill Clinton --  WATTERS: Even the President of the United States.  WILLIAMS: Did Bill Clinton take the stand? Bill Clinton testified.  GUTFELD: Not this guy.  WATTERS: Bill Clinton was actually convicted of felonies, felonies.  PERINO: Including perjury.  WATTERS: Not Donald Trump, not Donald.  GUTFELD: There's no crimes.  WATTERS: Those were agreed upon crime.  WILLIAMS: Bill Clinton --  WATTERS: Felonies. He was actually disbarred practicing law, Juan.  WILLIAMS: Excuse me. You must missed the history. Bill Clinton was not convicted by the Senate.  WATTERS: Bill Clinton was convicted and accused felonies by the special counsel.  WILLIAMS: You know, this is the --  WATTERS: And that was the truth of what happened in the 1990.  WILLIAMS: This is how people start marching in Trump lockstep.  WATTERS: This president hasn't even been accused of a felony.  WILLIAMS: Oh stop. Obstruction -- abuse of power in terms of bribery --  WATTERS: It's not a criminal charge, Juan. And they didn't even float the bribery article --  WILLIAMS: It is.  WATTERS: The guys couldn't hack it.  WILLIAMS: It's in --  WATTERS: They couldn't hack it. They didn't have the goods and they failed. And that's why you've been sitting around this desk for the last couple weeks, pouting and moaning. Because if you are in a good mood, because you know what justice would be done.  WILLIAMS: No, it's because you are here. I couldn't listen. I could listen to all this flack.  WATTERS: But our viewers is smiling because they know the end to the story. We know he's acquitted and we know he's reelected.  WILLIAMS: Here's why I was pounding. It's January and I was waiting for your snow job. I was waiting for you to come in with this nonsense.  WATTERS: Well, there's global warming, Williams, and were not getting any snow.  WILLIAMS: Well, I just think if he's so innocent, why don't you say bring it on, bring all the evidence. Instead, you're up here, stonewall.  WATTERS: You do the investigation in the House and then you try it in the Senate. You had your shot in the House. You failed. Let the senate adjudicate.  WILLIAMS: Because we have a president who's acting like a monarch --  WATTERS: You can change the rules, Juan.  WILLIAMS: -- and obstructing justice.  GUTFELD: That is an opinion, it is not fact.  WILLIAMS: It is. It's an opinion that he obstructed justice?  GUTFELD: All of this is based on opinion. Every problem that you have with Trump is based on I don't like his personality. He's mean, he's obnoxious.  WILLIAMS: He's told people don't testify, don't present --  WATTERS: That's not obstruction, Juan.  PERINO: Can I play a sound bite just for a moment.  GUTFELD: OK.  PERINO: So, this is Jerry Nadler, this is the C block intro soundbite number one. Control Room, if you can find that for me. So this is -- this whole issue like should there be witnesses or should there not. This is Chairman Nadler's position on Hunter Biden.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  REP. JERRY NADLER (D-NY): Any witness who has information about whether that is true or not true is irrelevant witness. Anybody like Hunter Biden who was no information about any of that, is not a relevant witness.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: So there you go. And they keep -- the position on the Democrats will be that they don't -- they might want certain witnesses but they don't want Hunter Biden.  WILLIAMS: But there's a difference between material and imitate.  PERINO: I know. I'm asking the lawyer.  WILLIAMS: All right.  COMPAGNO: Right. And that's partly why -- first of all, this hasn't changed. This position hasn't changed this entire time. The Democrats wanted to neuter the GOP's presentation in defense of calling witnesses. And to this entire time, they argue it's immaterial and the GOP argues it is material. So ultimately, it seems to me that their strategy would be yes, let's get - - let's get everyone in here. Let's get everyone in here. Everyone should be committed to the highest level of transparency because both sides are arguing the information and the facts should be construed in their favor. But we're going to see. I mean, the whole bottom line is --  PERINO: I don't think -- I don't think that Collins and Murkowski will be bullied into saying that there should be witnesses because Collins already signaled today that the House did an incomplete job. I do want to ask you about this, Greg.  GUTFELD: What?  PERINO: You had this great monologue set up for the debate last night.  GUTFELD: Yes, but we're going to use it tomorrow because I never throw anything away.  PERINO: So in the meantime, Klobuchar --  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: -- Sanders, and Warren, all three senators are like they're going to have to come off the campaign trail right 10 days before Iowa, sit there in the Senate, not being able to say anything. Is that a good idea?  GUTFELD: Well, it doesn't help them but it might help -- it might help Biden. That's what --  WILLIAMS: Big time. Big time.  GUTFELD: Look, the good news here is you've never seen a wider disconnect between reality and media. In reality, you have probably the most prosperous peaceful time in recent history. In decades, you have 29,000 stock market that's going to go higher. Meanwhile, the media is pushing impeachment as though the apocalypse is coming. And I think that America is smart enough that they're seeing this chasm. It can't be covered up anymore. It's too wide. And that's what you see in the -- in the list of things that are being trusted, Hollywood is the least trusted, slightly above that is the media. And I would actually think I trust Hollywood over the media at this point.  PERINO: What do you think about the debate last night? Did you have a chance to watch?  WATTERS: I did. I missed the (INAUDIBLE). I want to go back. I was completely bored by it. I thought it was flat. I guess Bernie had a good night. He's the only one with a little charisma. But I mean, he makes absolutely no sense when he talks about anything to do with money. Biden, for someone that's been in politics for 30 or 40 years, he seems befuddled by the basic elements of policy like health care, which should be his signature deal, Obamacare. He could just drop the hammer on these socialists on the stage and say, let's just expand Obamacare. Medicare for all is crazy. Let's move on, but he doesn't, because he doesn't have the skills and he's not sharp enough. And then the Liz Warren thing, man, she was so weak she had to play the gender card. I don't think it came off well. It's all she's got. She's fallen in the polls so she had to throw that out there.  PERINO: What do you think about Bernie Sanders?  WATTERS: It made her look small. And the moderators --  WILLIAMS: No, I think --  WATTERS: The moderators, in a he said she said, the moderators just side with she without even knowing what happens.  WILLIAMS: Well, this is interesting because this place to what Greg talks about in terms of media because I think CNN in terms of its reporting said, we know that Bernie said this to Elizabeth Warren, even though Bernie said I didn't say it. And in terms of me as the audience, wants to hear her have to argue with Bernie about his flat denial. I think that was unfair to Bernie. But it's telling -- it's telling that you are able to see at this table that Republicans have taken Bernie side in this argument.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Oh, yes, because I think --  WATTERS: You know when someone is getting (INAUDIBLE) by the press, Juan.  WILLIAMS: No, because you know, like President Trump knows, he thinks anyway, not knows. But he thinks Bernie is more easily defeated than Joe Biden. And even Elizabeth Warren who said, can a woman win, and she says, yes, look at the women on this stage. They are the ones who beat a Republican.  GUTFELD: Liz is not trustworthy.  PERINO: It was just a matter of fairness. And I think that you even saw Liberals say that Bernie was treated unfairly.  WILLIAMS: That's what I just said. I just think you got to treat the guy at his word. Give him --  PERINO: Well, it was pretty obvious, like the senator was saying. All right, so, that was a lot of fun.  GUTFELD: Was it?  PERINO: And it's -- it really was. That's it for us. You're going to set your DVRs because you're never going to miss an episode of THE FIVE. Special --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Are you? Unless they cut in again.  PERINO: Always set your DVRs.  WILLIAMS: Hey, you don't hold a grudge, do you?  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: OK, ""SPECIAL REPORT"" is up next.

105,FOX,"Elizabeth Warren accuses Bernie Sanders of sexism as Democratic presidential candidates trade jabs ahead of the Iowa Caucuses. It's “commie on commie” action! Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, is denying Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s claim that Sanders said a woman couldn’t win the presidency. Then, he blamed Trump! ""This is a story that was obviously put out by unnamed folks,"" Weaver said in an interview. ""For anybody to say that a woman can't win doesn't make sense. Hillary Clinton won 3 million more votes than Donald Trump did in the last election."" He added that Sanders participated in a discussion about ""Trump and misogyny,"" and that ""those conversations sometimes get misconstrued."" WARREN HEADS INTO CRUCIAL DEBATE ON THE ATTACK Ah yes, the three steps of identity politics, the hokey pokey of the left. First, screw qualifications. Focus on skin color or gender for that protective bubble of grievance. Second, always use the worst interpretation of a person's intent. If someone says they don't eat brown M&Ms, they must be racist. So misconstrue and deny good faith. Without both, you have no bigotry.  CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Third, find common ground by blaming Trump. Because, you know, he's evil, despite doing more for minorities than the clowns running against him. It’s hard not to love this. We’re watching the crocodile that is identity politics eat the party that fed it for years. Since candidates have become warring collections of traits and grievances, each now vies to become the most ""oppressed."" But since they've already smeared half the country, the only people left to destroy are themselves. It’s not a fight between left and right, but between liberals who now see there's no escape from their mindless, angry peers. Look at New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker. He’s a Stanford grad, Yale Law grad, Rhodes Scholar, and pro-school choice in a city where Democrats demolished public education. But even in his exit, he made it about identity. They didn't lose Booker; they lost a black guy. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP At some point, Democrats must realize that America is about unity, not difference. Trump got that. The only way to beat him is for his opponents to do the same. Which means four more years. Adapted from Greg Gutfeld’s monologue on “The Five” on Jan. 14, 2020.

106,FOX,"House prepares to vote to send the articles of impeachment against President Trump to the Senate; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" January 14, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everyone. I am Dana Perino, along with Emily Compagno, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5:00 in New York City. This is THE FIVE. Impeachment drama kicking into high gear on Capitol Hill, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the trial against President Trump will likely start next Tuesday. So mark it on your calendars. Speaker Nancy Pelosi is expected to end her month-long showdown with the House voting tomorrow to transmit articles over to the Senate. The Democrats are trying to dictate the terms of the trial and pressure Senator McConnell.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER: If you want the truth, you have to have witnesses. You have to have documents.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Senate should conduct a fair trial. A fair trial involves witnesses and documents. What is the president hiding from the American people?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When you have witnesses and you have documents, you have a full and fair trial. When you don't, you have a cover up.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: The Republicans think Democrats should be careful what they wish for.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It harms every senator running for president, with Iowa being February 3rd, and benefits Joe Biden. Joe Biden should actually make a pledge not to campaign while impeachment is on.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If the prosecution gets to call a witness, the defense should as well. If the prosecution gets to call John Bolton, then the president should be able to call Hunter Biden.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: All right, Jesse. I was trying to think of a metaphor but I couldn't think of one, but maybe you can. The permission to make an analogy granted to you right now. What is it like when you've had a month away from talking about impeachment, and now you have to gear back up for next Tuesday and remember all those names and all of those things? Like, I just don't know if people are going to want to do that.  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: It is like being on injured reserve the whole season, Dana. And then you have to go out and play the game, and you just have to remember the playbook.  PERINO: OK, that is a very good analogy.  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: I thought that was excellent.  WATTERS: Thank you. Thank you. That was a sports analogy.  PERINO: Does it ever work out for the injured reserve player?  WATTERS: Yeah. Just look the other, the LSU guy came -- the tight end. He had a huge game and he's been hurt all year.  PERINO: That's true. I saw that.  WILLIAMS: What about Lou Gehrig?  WATTERS: What about Lou Gehrig?  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: -- but I do think it's hard to gear back up to talk about impeachment again.  WATTERS: It is, but I'm ready, Dana. I can talk about that all day. And now, we know the Nancy Pelosi held the article. She wanted to squeeze concessions out of McConnell and frame the thing as rigged. She wanted to make sure the Democrats could participate at the debate tonight on CNN. I will be watching Hannity, though. And thirdly, she wants to handcuff Bernie and Liz Warren in the swamp while her favorite candidate, Joe Biden, gets to roam free and close by himself in Iowa. Now, all of those reasons are purely partisan, political reasons. They have nothing to do with fulfilling her duty to carry out her constitutional duty to check and balance the president of the United States. But we knew that, all right? Now, if I were a Republican in the Senate, I would say no witnesses. The House had its chance. That is not our job to do witnesses. Plus, it was a radically unfair deal in the House. You're not going to get that fairness from us. And if you guys want to roll the dice on witnesses, I think there is more of a risk for Democrats then there are Republicans. Because you know they're going to acquit the president. But what you don't know is what's going to come out of the testimony under oath from, I don't know, where is Hunter, or how about the whistle-blower, or Shifty Schiff, or to Chalupa (ph), our friend Chalupa (ph). So anything could come out of that, which could bury the Biden which could expose the hoax from the get- go. And I don't think a Bolton testimony hurts the president at all.  PERINO: Juan, I imagine you don't see it that way.  WILLIAMS: No. First of all, if I was a senator -- Jesse has the advantage. He has the skinny tie today. I have a fat tie. I would say there were two new developments today. One was that there will be the vote to send the articles tomorrow. And two, the selection of managers in terms of who's going to actually argue the case and how it's going to done apparently along the lines of how it was done during the Clinton impeachment. You know, about a six day process. So I think we're looking at two weeks. I would say this. I don't think that you can any longer underestimate Nancy Pelosi. Yes, there were stories, including stories about Democrats rousing about Pelosi and delaying the transmission of the articles. But I think what you said is right. Clearly now, there's a tremendous focus on the Republicans on admitting witnesses and documents and having a full trial. There is not going to be any speedy acquittal, which was initially what the White House and Senator Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, were thinking about. And I would say Hunter Biden. He will never be a witness. You know why? Because the moderate Republicans, who are now, I think, starting to assert themselves because of Nancy Pelosi --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: -- sure, bring in material witnesses.  WATTERS: It's not Hunter Biden. It is where is Hunter Biden.  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: Greg, there is someone over at MSNBC who was being a little critical --  (CROSSTALK)  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: How dare they, Dana? How dare they?  PERINO: Let's play that.  GUTFELD: My word.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is one of the reasons Trump kind of wants you to watch CNN instead of MSNBC, because he knows on MSNBC there will be no one defending him because we don't bring on liars. CNN has people on their payroll who they pay to tell their lies to the CNN audience in the middle of, you know, a CNN hour for some number of minutes.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: A little CNN-MSNBC argumentation.  GUTFELD: Whoa, I love that. It is like -- if you're going to put on a play, you have to pick your own performers. How dare you bring anybody that might disagree? Look, viewers need to be aware that the media is going to turn up the flame on the rhetoric because of the problem you stated before, that there has been this lapse in time. It's like summer vacation. You've got to get the kids back in school. So they're going to try to make this hiccup into a heart attack with their rhetoric. And what I resent -- and I'm going to betray my own weakness here, Dana. I resent that the Democrats in the media are playing the tune and making us dance. We have to dance to this tune. This is not a story. The media is like a drunken cowboy firing its six shooters at our feet, saying dance, dance. And so we have to dance and we have to pretend that this is real. We know that this is an emotional exercise to score points against Trump. We know that's all it is. The Dems -- look, I get it, and the person giving the advice to the Democrats, they're basically going through a wedding even though all signs point to divorce. We know how this is going to end. Trump is going to maintain his presidency. And he is going to redefine impeachment as a badge of honor. And I'm trying to tell the Democrats, this is going to hurt you. It's going to hurt you, but they don't listen. And why don't they listen? I will tell you why, Dana. Sunk costs, sunk costs are the investment in something that you don't get back, right? In a relationship, you stay with a bad relationship because of a sunk cost. You stay at a job forever because of a sunk cost, because you feel like you can't leave. That is what impeachment is to them. It's an emotional investment that they are seeing as a real investment, so they can't abandon all that work. When they should just step back and go, you know what, we won. We poked daddy in the eye with impeachment. We can move on. But they're not. They're going to chase this thing down. It's going to hurt them and it's going to reel (ph) like Trump.  EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Yeah. Here are my two analogies for it.  GUTFELD: No. Only I do analogies.  COMPAGNO: I only have two. So the first is exactly what you are saying. This is the Jesse Smollett of politics, which is that the Democrats, they can never go back on their word. They have to see it through. Remember how he then sued the city for malicious prosecution and everyone was, like, really? That is what they are doing. They are so far down --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: They are Smollett-ing.  COMPAGNO: Yes. They are Smollett-ing. And then I fell like the problem with your analogy for the injured reserve, is that unlike the impeachment trial, everyone cares about the football game. We want that guy to come play. Everyone wants to know what is happening. With this, no, we don't. So this is like, to me, when you get all geared up to go skiing and then you have on your 60 layers and get -- you almost get to the chairlift and then you have to go to the bathroom. And you have to go all the way back to the bathroom. So no one cares. No one is going to remember this. And by the way, this is the Senate's, however, opportunity to show a measured, impartial response that the House theatrics were anything but. And if the impeachment managers from the House are the media horrors we know them to be, they continue to be this circus. They're going to attempt to by using that rhetoric especially, but hopefully the senators will stay away from that.  PERINO: I'm never going to forget this skiing analogy.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Why don't you just do what most people do and just let it go?  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: I told you about that yellow snow.  PERINO: We knew it had to get somewhere. Coming up, the Democratic Party is tearing itself apart after Elizabeth Warren accusing Bernie Sanders of sexism. We will cover the fallout.  GUTFELD: Yes.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: It's commie on commie action. Bernie Sanders' campaign manager is denying Liz Warren's claim that Bernie said a woman couldn't win the presidency, then he blames Trump.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is a story that was obviously put out by unnamed folks. You know, he was invited -- Bernie was invited to Senator Warren's House. She told him she was running for president. For anybody to say that a woman can't win doesn't make sense. Hillary Clinton won 300 million more votes than Donald Trump did in the last election. So there's some wires crossed here. But clearly, Bernie Sanders did not say that a woman could not win. It was a discussion about Trump, misogyny, sexism, and politics, and the difficulty of running in the era of Trump for women, the special challenges that women face in the era of Trump. But, you know, those conversations can sometimes get misconstrued.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Misconstrued. Ah, yes, the three steps of identity politics, the hokey-pokey of the left. First screw (ph) qualification, focus on skin color or gender, for that protective bubble of grievance. Second, always use the worst interpretation of a person's intent. If someone says they don't eat brown M&Ms they must be racist. So misconstrue and deny good faith. Without both, you have no bigotry. Third, find common ground by blaming Trump, because you know he is evil despite doing more for minorities than the clowns running against him like Sanders. It is hard not to love this. Watch the crocodile that is identity politics eat the party that fed it for years, relegating candidates to warring collections of traits and grievances. Each and now buys for the most oppressed. But since they already smeared half the country, the only people left to destroy are themselves. So it's not a fight between left and right, but Libs, who now see there is no escape from their mindless, angry peers. Look at Cory Booker, Stanford grad, Rhodes Scholar, Yale Law, pro-school choice in the city where Democrats demolished public education. But even in his exit, he made it about identity. They didn't lose Cory Booker, no. They lost the black guy. At some point, the Dems must realize that America is about unity, not difference. Trump got that. And the only way to beat him for his opponents to do the same thing, which means four more years of Trump. All right, Juan, let's do a little quiz --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Wait a second, all right? Four more years of Trump, can I leave now?  GUTFELD: Don't move to New Zealand. We love you. All right, who is -- OK, this is the he said, she said, or they said. Let's say that they said just so the activist won't get mad. Who is more trustworthy? Bernie Sanders or Liz, who lied about being Cherokee, tried to cover up with a DNA test, which claims she was fired over being pregnant, lied about helping companies escape liabilities. Sanders is not a liar. She lied. She is not -- she cannot be the nominee, because how could she play the character role with Trump, like, go after his character. She is a scheming, lying liar.  WILLIAMS: She -- Mr. Trump --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: No, that was Mr. Sanders.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: She's lying. She's lying.  WILLIAMS: You know, it's not nice to bring it up, but Bernie has had some trouble, claims of how women were treated inside his own campaign that he's got to answer for. So I don't know. But I do think that when you look at these two, I would say that you could see both sides being absolutely true. That he was saying to her Trump is a bully, a sexist, and it's got to be hard for a woman to beat him. And look at what happened with Hillary last time. Or you could have her saying, what I'm hearing you tell me, Mr. Sanders is that a woman can't beat Donald Trump. But if that's the case -- and by the way, that is a huge conversation right now, you don't have -- I mean, you know, there's only two women on the debate stage tonight, right, Warren and Klobuchar.  GUTFELD: Yeah.  WILLIAMS: Right?  GUTFELD: Much more qualified, without a question.  WILLIAMS: But I think that when you stop and think about it, the conversation goes, well, who can beat Donald Trump if you are a Democrat? Would you trust a gay man? Would you trust Pete Buttigieg? Would you trust a black person, Cory Booker?  GUTFELD: Obama was president twice.  WILLIAMS: Apparent -- but not -- these guys aren't apparently in the same category. And this is not the same moment in history.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: -- running against Donald Trump, and you are looking at winning back white males in swing states. And so can -- how do you appeal to them? Who appeals to them? And I think lots of Democrats, some might say out of fear rather than hopefulness, are concerned that anybody but a white male is going to have the more difficult time.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: I can't believe I'm agreeing with everything Juan just said. I think she had to announce, and then out of respect for Sanders, they have to have a meeting, and she has to say, Bernie, I'm running, because he won millions of votes last time. He's kind of the socialist heir apparent. It's the right thing to do. And he maybe was a little offended. She is in his lane a little bit. Maybe this was his turn. And they start talking, as Juan said, X's and O's, didn't have a great success running Hillary against Trump last time. Trump may match up better against a woman for a certain reason. We don't know what it is. Talking, you know, shop, talking politics, and she may be interpreted that as a sexist comment.  GUTFELD: I doubt it. She is a liar.  WATTERS: I have to also agree with Juan. I had to agree yesterday. This helps Biden because the two people that are dividing the left voters fighting each other right now. But Bernie has to extricate himself from this smoothly, because if he does get the nomination, he is going to need these Warren votes. But at the same time, Liz Warren -- I don't know how she gets on the ticket. But if she does get on the ticket, she can't tee off Bernie bros, because Bernie bros, only 10 percent of them last time voted for Trump. So she can't antagonize his voters too much and call him a sexist, because if she ever gets the nomination, she is going to Bernie's votes.  GUTFELD: You know what, though? The other thing that bugs me about this whole thing Dana is that this was in a private meeting. And that makes her not just a liar, but a fink. She is a lying fink.  PERINO: I also wonder --  WILLIAMS: What's a fink?  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: You know, like a rat  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: Actually, I don't know if he really said it that way. But I do think that -- I have longed believed that if you are prone to take offense about something, you will hear people offending you everywhere you look. And I think that there are sometimes people like Elizabeth Warren that that happens to. Also, I think nobody saw it but on Sunday. Rahm Emanuel, the former chief of staff to President Obama, former Mayor of Chicago, like, every three months he writes an op-ed begging the Democratic Party to abandon identity politics.  GUTFELD: Yes.  PERINO: But nobody is listening to that anymore at all. And I saw today that another Obama administration alum said that he thinks because of what Warren did, with this leak of the private conversation, that the Native- American ancestry is now fair game for Bernie.  GUTFELD: There you go. Because she is saying these things --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: He didn't go after Hillary's emails. I don't think he's going after this.  GUTFELD: There's a lot of character problems with Liz Warren. And I think we see she can't be trusted, and she is a liar.  COMPAGNO: Well, I saw three problems with her pulling this stunt because obviously her camp did. Number one, it was too -- it was too inflammatory. Because the reality of that situation is probably actually how you described, which is a reality, X's and O's conversation, where he maybe he said something to the effect that look, I'm not sure if this will -- you're spit-balling, discussing. And she turns around and, A, rats him out, and it is obvious with it. So we see her as desperate. And B, it's quite plausible him denying it. I didn't say a woman couldn't win. Like, you know me. Tulsi even -- did you guys see, came out today and she said I had that same candid conversation with Bernie. And he showed me the greatest respect and encouragement that he is known for. So I think he and his camp is -- again, that plausible deniability, he is not that kind of guy that would hell no. Women couldn't win. Like, of course, he is not going to. And then I think the third thing, there was a person in Iowa actually that was quoted that I think summed up this. She's just a random voter. But the issue with Bernie supporters is that they get the sense that it's Bernie or no one. But with Elizabeth Warren that there's a broader coalition that they believe that bigger coalition might have the possibility and the propensity to actually galvanize more people. And then that will get them eventually that win. So that is the other side of that coin.  PERINO: I think the Bernie Sanders' campaign has a lot better organization, better people. You saw Jeff Weaver there on camera giving the response. You don't see any of the Warren people out.  WILLIAMS: One last thought on this is that there's so much hurt left over from the Clinton campaign in 2016, and a lot of it is still directed at Bernie. And so not only do the Obama people not feel comfortable with Bernie, neither do the Clinton people. And I think you're starting to see that come out now.  GUTFELD: But Bernie got the short end of the stick too, though, right, with the debate. So he has a reason to be upset. Anyway, I am tired of this topic. Why are you staring at me, America?  (CROSSTALK)  PERINO: -- super delegates.  GUTFELD: What?  PERINO: With the super delegates.  GUTFELD: They're not that super.  PERINO: Super duper.  GUTFELD: All right. Up next from Apple under fire for refusing to unlock the Pensacola shooting terrorists' IPhone.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WILLIAMS: Big tech privacy concerns once again clashing with the reality, the threat of terrorism. Attorney General Bill Barr calling out Apple, he says the company is refusing to unlock the iPhone of a suspected shooter at the Pensacola naval air station last month.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  BILL BARR, UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL: We have asked Apple for the help in unlocking the shooter's phone. So far, Apple has not given any substantive assistance. We call on Apple and other technology companies to help us find a solution so that we can better protect the lives of American people and prevent future attacks.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: But Apple is hitting back at the government. Quote, ""we reject the characterization that Apple has not provided substantive assistance in the Pensacola investigation. Our responses is to their many requests since the attack have been timely, thorough, and are ongoing."" So I'm curious about this one, Dana. Because Apple designs their phones so no one can get into it. There is no backdoor. But the government is of the opinion that they can do more than what they have done.  PERINO: Yeah. So I -- this is the encryption battle that we saw, remember in the San Bernardino terrorist situation. And this happened over and over again, where Apple is approached by the FBI. Can you help us? We need to get into this phone. And Apple has been very adamant that they have this technology. They think that it is bad for business. They say that they are cooperating. You know, I always tend to lean towards the law enforcement side, saying, well, look, if -- we know this was a terrorist attack. We know he had two phones that he tried to destroy. We are trying to see if there any co-conspirators, because we want to find out if there's anybody here that could possibly can hurt somebody. And Apple, in a way, I think they're on the shooting range with the attorney general, saying you aren't helping us track down a terrorist suspect. Now, from Apple's perspective, I think -- they think they have a pretty good answer as to the technology is the way that it is, that this is encrypted. This is their technology, that they will do what they can. But I think that Congress is going to have to get involved to try to help solve this. Congress is always years behind new technological developments, but this is not going to end with this one incident. It is going to keep going.  WILLIAMS: So Emily, here's my thought. If you put in the code, if you are Apple, well, then that's the end of privacy, right? For me, for you, for everyone at this table, everything about you, easy access, the government will have it. So the question is do you trust Apple or do you trust the government with everything about Emily?  COMPAGNO: Well, that is part of Apple's argument. And their additional argument is that if they create that backdoor, as you said, that it will be available for bad guys to exploit too. It's not just for the good guys. They argue if we create this, it is a Pandora's Box. Now, to be clear, in that San Bernardino case, what's interesting is that the FBI ended up dropping their suit because a third party vendor is what they use to get in. So Apple never had or potentially never provided -- I don't know if it exists, they argue it doesn't -- an encryption free version of iOS. And for viewers, I think the question remains -- for myself, too, when Apple says that it complied, they say they provided iCloud backups, they provided details of transactional data, and they provided account information for multiple accounts, what does that mean? What does that mean for this exact investigation? What I want to know is the specific questions that the FBI has that they're not responding to. Because at this point, we just have someone saying I asked for this, I asked for help, and Apple says we gave it to you. What does that mean for the investigation for our safety moving forward? But the answer to your question about private companies versus the government? I mean, the answer we see in public every day all day, which is all of us with our phones that China has access to and these private companies have access to, and no one cares.  WILLIAMS: So Jesse, Jim -- I'm sorry, Bill Barr and Jim Comey agree on this. They want Apple to cooperate.  WATTERS: That's the one thing they agree on, probably.  WILLIAMS: They agree.  WATTERS: If the Saudis started going into Apple headquarters in Silicon Valley and started gunning down a bunch of Apple executives, secretaries, and Tim Cook's employees, what is he going to do? He's going to crack into that phone before the Feds can, watching his employees getting murdered by Saudi terrorists. He's not going to wait. He's going to get in there and get justice for his employees, and he's going to try to, as you said, prevent future attacks on Americans. Right now, he's so far removed from reality, he's living in this land of theory and these pure principles while someone could be plotting attack right now. And we have in this country rights to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness. Right to life. He's putting a dead foreign terrorists privacy rights -- if they even have any -- above our rights as Americans. And I think that's totally misguided and he needs to get some sense knocked into him.  WILLIAMS: So Greg, Apple is hardware, its software, a little different than Facebook and Google, you know, which provide platforms. Where do you come up?  GUTFELD: What is a phone? I mean, what is it? How is a phone different than your house or your car? It contains things of personal value that is true. But the difference -- oh, but the phone is encrypted. So they create a language that then creates a new environment that we're supposed to respect. Oh, my God, a phone is different. This is different. Actually, it's not because the information has been shrunk. You have the entire space program on your phone, right? So you actually have more dangerous stuff in your phone than you would if you had stockpile bombs in your house. But you can't -- but that law enforcement can still get a search warrant and go into your house, they can get into your car. So this is a bogus -- it's a bogus idea. The but the bigger story for me is that we just had a terror attack on our soil, and it didn't really get a lot of press. And the reason why it didn't get a lot of press because we're living in a different era, the Trump era where a lot of the press is devoted to Trump and the people who hate Trump. I mean, the people that -- yes, the never Trumper or so you have. All the attention is on the impeachment, all the other attention is on Trump, and what's -- what we're forgetting is that terrorists still exist. We routed ISIS, that was a great victory, but the war continues to go on, and it's ongoing and endless. And especially with technology, when you marry terror plus technology, well, I always talk about the drone with anthrax, we're in a whole new era that's going to make 9/11 look pretty small. And I think that's one reason why Trump got the Republicans behind him is because he swore that was his number one thing to take terrorists seriously, and I hope to God we still do.  WILLIAMS: All right, coming up next, actor Vince Vaughn getting a lot of attention for shaking President Trump's hand. And what Alec Baldwin is saying about Trump supporters. That's all here next on THE FIVE.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WATTERS: President Trump getting major applause and cheers, not boos one during the college football national championship. And there's another story about the game that's getting a lot of attention. Actor Vince Vaughn talking and shaking hands with President Trump. And Alec Baldwin is going after Trump supporters, blaming them for the ""colossal destruction of everything that matters in America. The Vince Vaughn thing, Dana, it reminds me of the Ellen DeGeneres-Dubya meeting in the -- in the suite at the game.  PERINO: Not only that, and also Michelle Obama and Dubya.  WATTERS: Oh, yes.  PERINO: Remember, when they have their relation -- their friendship and everyone was so outraged by it. But the outrage was all -- it always comes from the left.  WATTERS: Right.  PERINO: It doesn't -- I don't think it's come from the right. Anybody could point that out to me. And I always think I would love to meet any president. If somebody comes, a president of the United States. It's like what an honor, the commander in chief.  WATTERS: Even Barack Obama?  PERINO: I met Barack and he was lovely to me.  WATTERS: Dana, did you smile and shake his head?  PERINO: Yes, he was lovely to me.  WATTERS: How dare you?  PERINO: Yes.  WATTERS: Juan, I know you had a fun time with Donald Trump when you saw him in the building. You guys were taking selfies and laughing and shaking hands.  WILLIAMS: Yes, right, yes.  WATTERS: There's nothing wrong with that, right?  WILLIAMS: No, I respect the office. I mean, he wasn't president at the time. But I do think this whole segment is about Oh, the left hates Donald Trump so much, so much. Hey, you know what, this is one person, one actor, and I think he's a libertarian as I understand it.  WATTERS: Yes.  WILLIAMS: It's fine from -- I think it's fine to respect when you run into him. But I don't think that it's good to suggest that the left is freaking out. I say what -- who's freaking out? There's one guy I saw citing.  PERINO: It's on Twitter.  WILLIAMS: Oh, Twitter. Twitter, Dana, can you say Twitter is nothing --  PERINO: I have to say, remember when Chris Christie hugged President Obama after Hurricane Sandy because he came and the --  WATTERS: It cost Romney the election.  WILLIAMS: But you can't -- you can't name five people on the left who were upset about this.  WATTERS: What do you think?  COMPAGNO: I think -- just what kills me is how -- that's civility. That's kindness. Isn't that what everyone on the left is calling for? Meaning, when we see a video like that, which is two people regardless of party, but let's say if he isn't independent, so two different parties, or a party agnostic and another one, shouldn't we be applauding that? Shouldn't the left say, Vince Vaughn, what a wonderful example of humanity above all else? But instead, they're falling into, if that is something that we should be outraged over, A, what is something that -- like, the bar becomes ridiculously low, and B, it eradicates everything that they're always calling for, which is for us to be singing Kumbaya, and all be together.  WATTERS: I'm a lip reader, Greg, and you know what Vince told the president?  GUTFELD: What?  WATTERS: Lock her up?  GUTFELD: Oh, really? That's amazing.  WATTERS: It's very clear to me.  GUTFELD: That's -- going back to Juan's point, are people really freaking out, or by people do we just mean people on Twitter which is what this is? And there are facsimiles of people who still have a very low investment in their opinion. They're not even thinking when they're writing stuff. I'm including myself in that point. But also, now so you see media bloggers whose -- this is their life to like clip out stuff and put it up there and hope they get lights, and maybe they can prove to their boss that people actually read their stuff when nobody really cares. It's a terrible job to have. I feel bad for you. As for Alec Baldwin talking about the colossal destruction, is he talking about the economy? Is he talking about our nation's health? Is he talking about the peace and prosperity? Because I'm trying to figure out where the colossal destruction is. I think that he might be clouded by his cognitive dissonance, and that the senses that he wanted bad things to happen and bad things haven't happened. So he's trying to meld his brain into a reality that doesn't fit. I actually feel bad for him.  WATTERS: All right. And congratulations to LSU. Big win last night. Stay tuned. Yes, Greg, there was a game last night.  GUTFELD: Basketball?  WATTERS: Yes, basketball. ""FASTEST SEVEN"" ahead.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  COMPAGNO: Welcome back. Time for the ""FASTEST SEVEN."" First up, love sure can get messy at times.  WATTERS: There we go.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There you go.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's fine.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you OK?  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm what?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What the hell? Are you OK? I'm so --  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well --  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh no.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm over it.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  COMPAGNO: That is a contestant embarrassing herself in an attempt to surprise the series bachelor Peter Weber with some bubbly. OK, you guys, this is actually when I love the Internet. I don't watch this show. I never have. But I love to that --  GUTFELD: What?  WATTERS: Emily, how have you and I watched it and you haven't?  GUTFELD: Yes, what's your problem?  COMPAGNO: You guys watched this show?  GUTFELD: Yes.  WILLIAMS: I agree with you.  COMPAGNO: Anyway, the internet is hilarious because of all the memes and the funny comments which my favorite was, the devil works hard, but the production team of the Bachelor works harder, honey.  WATTERS: I agree with that because this was a producer setup. There's no way that Pete is not in on this, the pilot. He's handing her a bottle of champagne and tell her to drink from it. She's like 20. She's probably never even done that before.  GUTFELD: I think she brought --  WATTERS: This was a total set up.  GUTFELD: I don't know. Here's the deal, man. Champagne is a scam. You open it up, you lose half of it on your shirt, you pay $100. You know, if champagne were hot, this wouldn't happen.  PERINO: I wish I lived in the 20s where they're drinking champagne all the time.  WATTERS: Thank you for laughing on that. What?  PERINO: I'm liking the 20s. They just drink champagne all the time.  GUTFELD: That's true. Those were the good -- were in the 20s.  PERINO: That's right.  GUTFELD: We're in the 20s.  COMPAGNO: Yes, we are.  PERINO: Yes, we should start it.  GUTFELD: Yes.  (CROSSTALK)  COMPAGNO: One of my favorite drinks is the last word I think which is that era, right? Anyway --  GUTFELD: What are you talking about?  COMPAGNO: Juan, what -- sorry.  WILLIAMS: I don't watch the show. It looked embarrassing. I hate to see people, you know, mock like that. But I don't really know much about it.  COMPAGNO: She signed up for it if she is doing that show.  WILLIAMS: Yes. If you do a reality show, you get what you're paid for, right? It's worse than pro football.  COMPAGNO: Yes. You said you had something else to say about it?  WATTERS: No, I have nothing to say about that. (INAUDIBLE)  COMPAGNO: All right, next up, Hollywood is not happy with this year's non- inclusive Oscars after a majority of the nominations went to male-dominated projects.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Congratulations to those men. And finally --  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Who's that?  COMPAGNO: All right, what do you guys think about that?  GUTFELD: Me?  COMPAGNO: I mean, of course, this is going to happen because this is another example of a -- of an entrenched system where, like everything, racism and classism exists. And so for people in Hollywood, to think that they were actual activists just because they're vapid voices joined people who are actually efforting for change, and they think it's actually going to change after just one year of Twittering about it, of course not.  GUTFELD: Shouldn't -- but wait a second.  COMPAGNO: What did I do?  GUTFELD: You are so wrong, we should be focusing on talent and quality, not on traits. If you wanted to focus on traits, Emily, look at the average height of the people that win. Taller people tend to win over shorter people but we don't talk about that, do we, Dana?  PERINO: But they look taller on T.V., a lot of them are.  COMPAGNO: At the Oscars?  GUTFELD: They do. By Hollywood standards, they're tall.  PERINO: But a lot of them are short.  GUTFELD: Yes, but the thing is --  PERINO: But not pitch short.  GUTFELD: No, but this is just fodder for the mediocre to complain. Identity politics pollutes everything it goes to. Every -- and by the way, everybody gets a new angle for a story now. It's like, oh, I can't do the Oscars. Do the Oscars and people getting shut out? OK, yes, inject it with racism and sexism because then you got a new angle and you get an extra $35.00 for the post.  WILLIAMS: Well, I happen to agree with you. I think that the problem is that a lot of these studio executives haven't been given opportunity not only to women but to minorities. So to blame the Oscars, I don't think it's fair because the Oscars is going to reflect what's on the table. You got to go in and attack a deeper structure which is they do business with people like them and people, they've known, and people who have their track record. It's not the case that women can't direct film. That's not the case that minorities can't act. I mean, it's crazy, but it's not the Oscars per se, it's the system. So I think you're right.  GUTFELD: That the virtue signaling is killing movies. It's killing movies. If you just look at -- if you look at like, what's happened to the Star Wars franchise, which I haven't but --  WATTERS: I have a feeling like I'm going to say something sexist here so I'm going to ask Dana to hold my hand and just squeeze it if I go down the wrong path, OK. Can women Just admit that sometimes men produce products that are better than women?  WILLIAMS: Sometimes.  WATTERS: And can men sometimes admit that women sometimes produce products that are -- that are better? And then, can we all admit that sometimes sex has nothing to do with the quality of the product?  GUTFELD: Yes.  WATTERS: Did I get that all right?  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: You are going almost in the Michael Scott territory.  COMPAGNO: Yes, but that was kind of awesome. All right. Finally, researchers have discovered the age you will be most miserable. I'm so excited about this.  PERINO: Oh, I like this story.  COMPAGNO: Yes. 47.2 years, that age is found to be the moment of peak misery in the developed world. So I wanted to ask you if that was --  GUTFELD: Why me?  COMPAGNO: Is that your age?  GUTFELD: No. every decade is good because if you consider the alternative, it's pretty good. Actually, it gets better. Jonathan Roush wrote the Happiness Curve. That's about this. It doesn't get older. Everything gets better because you're smarter. You don't give a damn.  PERINO: Yes. I was --  GUTFELD: And you're not dead.  PERINO: I was really happy to hear this because I'm on the -- I'm on the happy end now, apparently.  GUTFELD: What does that mean?  WILLIAMS: Oh my God.  PERINO: Oh my God.  GUTFELD: What? I don't know what you're talking about.  PERINO: Do need me to hold your hand and squeeze --  WILLIAMS: Give him some champagne.  WATTERS: No, I think misery is a choice unless there's clinical depression.  GUTFELD: Thank you.  WATTERS: Obviously, there's a problem there.  GUTFELD: Nice save.  WATTERS: But a lot of people -- a lot of people --  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: Have a drink, go for a run, exercise, play a sport, go on a vacation, you can get out of that slump.  WILLIAMS: You know what -- you know what, I'm 65. I pass this point. But Jesse, I'm worried about you. The clock is ticking, brother. You're approaching this moment.  WATTERS: Yes, I got a few more years, Juan.  PERINO: I think he's -- OK.  WILLIAMS: You think he's going to -- he's going to pass because I think, you know what, there are a lot of sad people, broken people in the country. We got to do something about that.  WATTERS: Is that the people who didn't vote for Trump? Is that what you're saying?  WILLIAMS: Is that what it is?  COMPAGNO: All right. ""ONE MORE THING"" is up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PERINO: It's time now for ""ONE MORE THING."" I'll go first here. So sticking with your New Year's resolutions for fitness, it can be difficult. But if you're Dan Hill, you sometimes don't have a choice. He got locked in his gym while swimming laps when the staff left without realizing it was there. And he documented his entrapment with a Facebook post saying I am literally locked inside 24 Hour Fitness right now. They closed the doors and went home while I was swimming laps in the pool, which I don't get because it's 24 Hour Fitness, but anyway. So Dan called his wife and she told him, find a comfortable place to hunker down and sleep, and the police rescued him just before 1:00 a.m. And he -- apparently he said he's going to take some new precautions to make sure he isn't missed in the pool again. Thanks to Gail Hauser. She was on Twitter. She sent me that today. That's pretty funny.  COMPAGNO: That's hysterical. I got locked in the garage at a friend's house this weekend, and I just texted and then it took a while for them to get the text and then --  PERINO: Wow.  COMPAGNO: I was help -- I was helping myself to the fun fridge and then I got locked in the garage. That is like my worst nightmare, that guy. Did you -- late at night locked in a gym.  WATTERS: He didn't have a fun fridge. I mean --  PERINO: All right, Greg.  GUTFELD: God. All right, Fox Nation, if you're a subscriber, go check out Tyrus' ""NUFF SAID."" He interviews me. We talk about movies, we talk about our lives, it's a lot of fun. Go there. If you're not a subscriber, you should do that. It's a lot of fun. It's like an hour interview. All right, let's do this more important. Greg's peloton news. As you know, I purchased the peloton for the wife, but she hasn't used it yet, but I've used it. I'm having a hard time getting on that damn thing with the shoes. I have some footage of me trying to get on the peloton. That's really hard. It's like takes me forever to get on there and try to clip the shoes in. So I'm often just kind of there. This is my exercise for -- this is what I do.  PERINO: It gets your heart rate up.  GUTFELD: It's got the -- there, I finally get on there. Everything is good, but I could keep watching that forever, my tiny little legs.  WATTERS: How's Anton, by the way, Greg?  GUTFELD: Anton is great. He's the -- he's the beginning trainer, yes. He keep telling me I'm better than that.  PERINO: You can do it. You can stick with it. All right, Jesse.  WATTERS: Jesse's fish tales. There we go. Look at that hat. I hate fishing, actually. Get a load of this Warsaw grouper off the coast of Florida, 350 pounds. This Fish is 50 years old, a little old for fish, still younger than Greg, though.  WILLIAMS: Right around the misery index. I mean, that's what happens --  WATTERS: You die, you get caught.  GUTFELD: It's like a Liz Warren lie.  WILLIAMS: Oh, my gosh.  COMPAGNO: How long would it lived otherwise if it wasn't cut --  PERINO: They using -- they were going to use it for some scientific research though, so don't be too upset.  GUTFELD: And then eat it.  PERINO: All right, Juan.  WILLIAMS: All right, I think you know more about my ""ONE MORE THING"" than I do. Celebrating, your return with a box of chocolates, flowers. That's totally old school. How about something fresh, like a reunion with this most famous person you've ever met. Take a look at the retirement party for iHeartRadio receptionist Anita Scipio.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  ANITA SCIPIO, RECEPTIONIST, IHEARTRADIO: Oh my God. I can't believe it.  WILL SMITH, ACTOR: You're retiring.  SCIPIO: I'm retiring, sweetheart. Oh my God.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: Yes, that's actor Will Smith. He met Scipio when he came to do his first interview as an actor 30 years ago. Since then, obviously, four Grammys, nominated for two Oscars. Smith wrote on Instagram, ""She said I made her day, you all, she made mine."" Fresh Prince, Men and Black star, he deserves an Academy for that performance.  PERINO: All right, Emily.  COMPAGNO: OK, speaking of French Prince, I love this. So Burger King basically came out and offered these two new former Royals now regular people who need jobs, a job. They tweeted, if you're looking for a job, we have a new crown for you, which I think is so witty and funny. They said, do like thousands of people and take your first steps in the world of work with us. You know that the crown will suit you perfectly. And then they included a link for an application for a job. I love it. Isn't that awesome?  GUTFELD: No, it's not.  COMPAGNO: It is awesome.  WATTERS: What do they call fries in Great Britain? What do they call them?  PERINO: Chips.  GUTFELD: Chips.  WATTERS: Would you like some chips with that? That's my British accent.  PERINO: Brilliant.  COMPAGNO: That's annoying. It's like coming to --  PERINO: All right, set your DVR. Never miss an episode of THE FIVE. I'll see you on ""TUCKER"" later on. But ""SPECIAL REPORT"" is up next. Hey, Bret.

107,FOX,"Sorry, media: It looks like Iran hates its own government more than it hates us. This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" January 14, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Hi, I am Greg Gutfeld with Emily Compagno, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and in an oven mitt, it's her sleeping bag, Dana Perino, THE FIVE. Sorry, media. It looks like Iran hates its own government more than it hates us. Instead of burning U.S. flags, what did you see at Sunday's protests in Iran over its government shooting down that airliner? A bunch of Iranians refusing to act the way our media wished they would. Demonstrators refused to walk on American and Israeli flags while others attacked images of General Soleimani. Yes, as much as they were expected to despise those two countries, it seems they loathe the revolutionary guard much more. Video also showed government forces firing live ammo at the protesters. Media outrage here seems at a low end, though. They're still too busy complaining about Trump tweeting mean things about them. Yet in Iran, people who speak out endure bullets. Yet in America, the outrage is over memes. But also the Oscars, why no best director for little women, poor Greta, I blame Trump. Meanwhile, yet another media narrative implodes. We now learn that Trump authorized the killing of Soleimani seven months ago. Talk about impulsive, erratic, and unstable. Trump only waited seven months to take the guy out? Clearly, he is a maniac, crazy on blood lust. Where is the 25th Amendment when you need it? So once again, the media lies to you about everything. They painted Soleimani as a folk hero, not true. And they repeat the lie that Trump was acting irrationally, part of the madmen persona they helped fabricate. It's not true either. Only in America can our media get everything so wrong and still see themselves as the good guys. I guess that's the only way they can look in the mirror without throwing up. Welcome back, Dana, from your, quote, ""tennis camp,"" unquote. DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: That's what we are calling it. GUTFELD: That's what we are calling it, tennis camp. Who goes to tennis camp, America? PERINO: You wouldn't believe what I really did. GUTFELD: I can't wait to hear about it in the break. So does this feel like a new chapter in Iran or is that wishful thinking on my part? PERINO: I think it might be possibly, although we've seen this story because it writes itself over and over again. So I believe that everybody and every human is born with this desire for freedom. It's innate. It's something that we all have. So then you have these dictatorial governments that are trying to ram down people's throats to keep them down, keep them from opportunity, tell them what to wear, tell them what to think. They want their talents and they want their brains, but they don't respect their hearts. And so you see this in Hong Kong, Venezuela, Iraq, Lebanon, now Iran. We will get to that. And you think about the Arab Spring. There are these movements and then they get snuffed out. And then you think about Venezuela, for example, so we kind of help but then we can't do it all. GUTFELD: Right. PERINO: So I do think it is a possibility that there could be some changes, but that would mean that Iran would have to change quite fundamentally. And I would bet that they are biding their time right now. But what we know about them in December, Iran killed about 900 of its own citizens in -- because they were protesting, and this is before any of this happened. GUTFELD: Yeah. Maybe that might've been directed by Soleimani, who is no longer here, Jesse. PERINO: It was. GUTFELD: Yes. Thank you for that. Jesse, I get the feeling that maybe Iran wasn't as overjoyed or in love with Soleimani as our media told us. JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST Yeah. I bet the people that came out to mourn Soleimani were people that were backed by the Iranian regime. And it is funny that the media has taken the same perspective as the Iranian regime. Think about it. They mourned Soleimani, both of us. And then they blamed Trump for shooting down the airline, both the American media and the Iranian regime. And then they said that the street protests, oh no, those street protestors -- lots of reasons for people to be on the street, maybe somewhere shopping, maybe they were just out getting a breath of fresh air. But that fundamentally misunderstands the threat of protesting in Iran. You can get put to death if you chant death to ayatollah, which they were doing. It doesn't take any bravery to chant death to Trump, down with America. It's an evil empire. Everybody does that over there. And they're doing that because they get paid to do it. Now, when Trump goes in there and takes out a bad guy without having to pay a bribe, with no American casualties, 9 out of 10 Americans give the guy a round of applause. Only the media creates a scandal over Trump killing a terrorist. How many terrorists did Barack Obama take out in the Taliban? How many generals in Libya across the Middle East? He didn't have his guys go on the Sunday shows the next weekend telling the media, oh, here is the documentary evidence that he had that he was planning an imminent attack. He didn't have to do that because the media didn't demand he do that. Soleimani's in business to kill Americans. His job for the last three decades is to plot attacks against Americans and our allies. We don't need a specific piece of raw intelligence saying, oh, he is about to kill an American. It's what he does for a living. So we killed him first, and there is nothing scandalous about that at all. GUTFELD: Juan, feel for you to respond to anything this brilliant man just said. JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: I don't even know where to start. The idea that Obama didn't go after and kill terrorists, I mean -- (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: -- so many drones -- (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: His use of drones to kill terrorists that people said why is he doing this and why does he -- if we are going to go in should we send troops as opposed -- anyway, let me just go back -- (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: He was not hammered the way this administration has been hammered. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: I don't think the Republicans came out and went crazy when Barack Obama -- (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: Whatever you think is not right. But OK, let me just say this -- (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: Greg, you are conflating two very separate events. After Soleimani's assassination killing, whatever you want to call it, there were people in the streets. Jesse says they were paid. I don't know. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: -- that's what you guys say my, but now there are people in the streets legitimately as much as Americans would be upset if our government shot down an airline. But they're not the two of the same events. They're separate events. And they have every reason to be angry at their government, which is now admitted that they made a huge mistake that took 100 plus lives. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: OK. You were saying they're in the streets now -- (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: You are saying they hate their government more than they hate Trump. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: You go live in Iran. WILLIAMS: No, here's the other part of this. The idea that somehow Democrats are to be, as Trump was today, putting Schumer and Pelosi in this picture with the Arab -- at the Iranian -- this is a vile thing that somehow Democrats don't go after terrorists or hate on people like Soleimani. Every Democrat has made a clear statement. Soleimani was a bad guy. And then finally, that NBC then says, oh, yeah, seven months ago, he gave the authorization that if you have a shot, OK. So then Trump comes out and says what difference does it make if I had information about an imminent attack. The defense secretary says I never saw any evidence of an imminent attack. Trump says that Laura Ingraham, oh, there were four embassies -- this guy is making stuff up. And you guys are just running around, like, anything he does is just fine. GUTFELD: Number one, we do realize you're only allowed to say imminent when you're talking about climate change, right? Only Democrats can use the word imminent, and it has to do with global warming, OK? Emily, I want to get you in here. I honestly think that what we are seeing right now is the real Iran. And a door is opening for actually some new dialogue that had been blocked, obstructed by the guy who is now dead, Soleimani. EMILY COMPAGNO, GUEST CO-HOST: Yes, I agree. And I want to speak to just the perspective of the left and the mainstream media on these protests. Because the protests became inconvenient for the left and inconvenient for our media, because up until then, the Iranians were used as a tool for both of those entities when it was an anti-Trump vehicle for them. They were able to further that message. And these are people allegedly who cared deeply about democracy and freedom and those tenets. And yet all of a sudden, they are mute, when as you said not two months ago, up to 1500 citizens were murdered for protesting increase in gas prices. These protesters are out there literally risking their lives because they are saying death to the supreme leader. And they're saying specifically Trump is not the problem. Soleimani is. The Iranian government is. They are literally blowing open the sham and the bullying to let that light in. And there have been crickets from both the left and the mainstream media. Final point, this -- the foreign threat and the regime and the terror state that Iran is, that is a bipartisan threat. And the most dangerous thing we can all do to ourselves, because believe me, all bleed the same, is to politicize. So I really hope the left gets in gear and starts viewing this from an American perspective rather than an anti-Trump perspective. GUTFELD: All right, let's go to a break, shall we? PERINO: We shall. GUTFELD: All right, break, it's some that's tennis lingo. Coming up, President Trump mocking the 2020 candidates, and why Bernie Sanders is being accused of sexism. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PERINO: Actually, Greg, speaking of country music, I have a theme this week, and if anybody can guess it by Friday I will send you -- calendar. (CROSSTALK) PERINO: -- between Senator Warren, Bernie Sanders. Senator Warren furious after learning that Sanders volunteered and called her a candidate of the elite in conversations with voters. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ELIZABETH WARREN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I was disappointed to hear that Bernie is sending his volunteers out to trash me. We all saw the impact of the factionalism in 2016. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: Sanders denies that he had anything to do with it, and now things are getting even more heated with accusations of sexism. Sanders reportedly told Warren during a 2018 meeting that a woman cannot win in 2020. And Sanders is calling that report ludicrous. So this is the moment I have been waiting for. They're finally going to have to go at each other, Jessie, because they both can't win. And they have the same type of supporters. WATTERS: Yeah. I just think it is so lame, these attacks. PERINO: -- stronger attacks. WATTERS: Yeah. I long for the days when Trump used to make fun of people's haircuts right to their faces. COMPAGNO: You set 2020 goals for yourself was not to support or talk about personal attacks. WATTERS: I said I wouldn't participate. I'm not saying I wouldn't enjoy other people doing it. GUTFELD: You're going to be on the sideline, egging on the bullying. WATTERS: Like, I would never make fun of the new nickname for Mayor Mike Bloomberg, mini-Mike. I would not participate in that type of hate-shaming. It's not something I do. PERINO: It would be beneath you. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: I made a commitment. But in all seriousness, though, it is fun watching my prediction come true about a brokered convention. Because let's say Bernie wins the first two primaries, and then Super Tuesday becomes stop the Bernie train, and Bloomberg and Biden are throwing all they can at this guy. And you get to Milwaukee, and then they rob Bernie again. AOC is going to be out in the streets with her squad. It's going to be a bloodbath, or they are forced to put Bernie somehow on the ticket. Imagine Bernie-Biden. Imagine Bernie-Warren. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: That's a lot of BENGAY. (CROSSTALK) PERINO: I accidentally combined the two names of Bernie and Biden today, and it comes out as a burden. (CROSSTALK) PERINO: One, do you think that Sanders is someone -- he wants to fight. He is willing to fight. He's got the brass knuckles out there. He's going to go for it. And he could be the one that points out that Elizabeth Warren has a lot of inconsistencies in her background. And she did all this corporate work that would make his supporters not want to turn to her. WILLIAMS: That's possible. But, you know, at this point -- look. This is all standard. We got three weeks to go to Iowa. Things are going to get tighter. There's distinctions to be drawn. She could take shots at him even though she is the one that's been falling in the polls. And I think that -- she falling in the polls, it has a lot to do with her own sort of implosion on the Medicare for All. (CROSSTALK) PERINO: -- linked this report that Bernie Sanders said a woman can't win. WILLIAMS: Oh, no. I think that's true, but that's coming in response. But that's my guess. I don't know that that's true. I just think that she's the one that leaked that. I guess you do too. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: But I think that overall, if you have Sanders and Warren going at each other, let's say, tomorrow night in Des Moines at the next Democratic debate. The winner from that is Joe Biden, because they are not going at the man who is the national leader at the moment. So the second thing to say here is once that you get a sense of Donald Trump jumping in, he has been, just today, delighting in the idea that Sanders is taking on Warren. Warren is this and that, because he is the incumbent. The incumbent has an advantage. He can stay there and take these pot shots. But you know what? That dynamic changes once there is a Democratic nominee. Democrats, as much as they've been trailing in terms of fund-raising to President Trump's campaign, you know the overall fundraising to the Democrats is about on par, and it looks to me like Democrats are fired up to take out Trump. PERINO: Do you think the media, Greg, has taken the Bernie Sanders candidacy seriously? GUTFELD: You know how much I don't like to bash the media. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: I think they want to anoint the person who is going to win. And that's why they don't think Sanders is going to win. That's why they bumped him out for Hillary. The media chooses the Democratic candidate. That's a fact. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: And they can't control Bernie's people. GUTFELD: Yeah, they can't. Here's the thing. Trump makes all these candidates look like runner-up's at The Bachelor, right? They seem so much smaller. You know, you can hate Trump all you want, but you can't replace America's bad boy. And he is America's bad boy. He's Fonzie. And they are all patsies. And right now, these candidates are suffering from Trump oxygen depletion effect, which happened in 2016. Trump walks into the room, sucks at all the oxygen, but he's getting an assist from the media. So what happens is you end up having to have Liz and Bernie mimic him in these attacks, because that's the only way they're going to get any oxygen -- (CROSSTALK) PERINO: -- so the other thing that happened today is that Cory Booker, the Senator from New Jersey, he dropped out of the race. What you make of that? COMPAGNO: Yeah. I mean the sad reality is if you are not in the top tier for these candidates, then the dropout is in it of itself a footnote. And if I could just comment on that cocoon infighting of Sanders and Elizabeth Warren -- GUTFELD: You mean the movie? COMPAGNO: No, the two old people going at it. Yes, exactly, which is so tiresome and predictable that she put him on blast and then that he comes at her in that way to begin with, because that is reminiscent of the 2016 campaign. And just because she's more liberal than Hillary doesn't make her free -- you know off the market for attacking. And I think he has that luxury of being the furthest left in the top tier. So he is going to use his ideology as a weapon on issues, substantively and then also of character, right, just like he did with Hillary. You have your Goldman Sachs speeches, and Elizabeth Warren, you've done your corporate work and whatnot. And I think that ultimately as she is fading, she is grasping at straws, planting things so that she puts herself in the story. And likewise, he is pouncing on her weaknesses, but that the overall winner from that is going to be Biden. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: Just one last thing before we go. I just think that tomorrow night, the big news is that Tom Steyer isn't in this. This brings us back to the power of money that Bloomberg has been pumping up. And now you see, according to Fox polls, you see Steyer, I think, at like 15 percent in South Carolina, 12 percent in Nevada, and suddenly, he is on stage. Now, it's going to be -- (CROSSTALK) PERINO: And money is Trump's identity. WILLIAMS: Well, money seems to me -- (CROSSTALK) PERINO: Cory Booker proved that nice guys finish last. WILLIAMS: Well, Cory Booker has been bitter about the idea that billionaires have brought their -- (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: He was my best impression. I had a good one. PERINO: You had a good one. But you know what? You'll always have -- (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You can't stop the show now. Go ahead, Cory. GUTFELD: He talks like he just had a hot slice of pizza, and so his mouth is on fire, and he needs a glass of milk. PERINO: All right. Coming up, some Democrats privately admitting that Nancy Pelosi's Trump impeachment strategy has failed. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WILLIAMS: Nancy Pelosi ramping up her attacks against President Trump. It comes as she's expected to send over articles of impeachment to the Senate this week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NANCY PELOSI, HOUSE SPEAKER: Let's be optimistic about the future, a future that will not have Donald Trump in the White House. One way or another, 10 months from now, we will have an election if we don't have him removed sooner. But again, he will be impeached forever. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: The Speaker also not ruling out the possibility of issuing a new article of impeachment. And Pelosi continues to go after Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and Republicans. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PELOSI: The leader of the Senate, Mitch McConnell, has signed on to a resolution to dismiss the case, to dismiss the case. That, in his view, maybe -- (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But he's committed to having the presentations first now. PELOSI: I am telling you that he signed on, on Thursday to a resolution to dismiss the case, the dismissing is a cover-up. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: A cover-up. So Greg, how would you make this out, a cover-up is what she is saying. In fact, I think most Americans, and even most Republicans, say that if you don't have witnesses and documents that essentially it is a cover-up. GUTFELD: No. Actually, you know what's funny. I love the fact that the Democrats are hiding the whole point of this, which is they wanted to score an impeachment as an emotional victory against daddy, right? Trump to them is daddy. And he is still there. But it never mattered if he was going to leave or go, because they wanted to punch daddy, because he is so mean to them. We have to ask ourselves, as Americans, are we OK with a government who use their office to exact an emotional tantrum. We paid for this tantrum. How much of that tantrum cost on lost work and wages, all the drama. The bright side, though is for America, Trump is still in power, kicking ass with one of the greatest economies in world history. And the media and the Democrats got what they wanted, which was an emotional payback, so it's kind of a win-win. On a separate note, I cannot get my shoes out of the Peloton Bike. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: All right. So Emily, how would you rate her strategy? Because there was a Washington Post reporter who was on the air today, saying lots of Democrats are grasping that this strategy didn't accomplish anything. COMPAGNO: Exactly. I think it is a failed transparent strategy that did nothing more than waste our tax dollars. And every step of the way was so obvious, especially by her own comments even when you saw it just there, where she says it's just a box to be checked. It's just so that we can have this label put on it. And I think the big issue facing Democrats and her now is the fact that this entire gambit has run out of steam. And we saw that even at the height of their impeachment growing, we saw that the polls reflected that the Americans were exhausted by it. They were uninterested in it. And now, even more so, we have the situation in Iran. We have the Iowa caucuses coming just right around the corner. People do not care about this. And for some reason, it's just like -- remember Spidey (ph) in L.A. who -- they would continue to insert themselves because they wanted to stay relevant. She is grasping at every possible topic to try to keep this thing relevant when the rest of the world knows that it's been a dead a long time. WILLIAMS: Well, Jesse, let's go to the counter argument, which is, in fact, she has now put the focus on whether or not there will be a fair trial in the Senate with witnesses, with documents, or it's just McConnell saying you know what, I said he was going to be acquitted. I'm coordinating with the White House. It doesn't matter. What do you say, Jesse? WATTERS: Because the House trial was so fair, Juan. That was the height of fairness. It doesn't get any more fairer, that trial than that, right? Of course, you thought it was fair. GUTFELD: Compared to Kavanaugh -- WATTERS: Right, OK. To Emily's point, we used to lead the show for months on impeachment. Now, it's like halfway through. No one cares anymore. To Greg's point about who's your daddy, Trump is doing so much damage to the Democratic Party. He destroys them everyday on live television, on Twitter. He busts through the blue wall. He is nominating a hell of a lot of judges. And this has got a great economy, outflanked among trade and wages, that's why they are so mad. They're hysterical. This whole impeachment thing was just a backup plan because Mueller failed. And then this failed because they did it all in the dark. Once it saw the light of day, everyone said, OK, never mind, let's move on. If you think about what she says, it's so predictable. Give me everything I want. No, you're guilty of a cover-up. That's obstruction. But he released the transcripts, the most transparent thing you could do. And if you start asking questions to her, hey, what about the whistleblower or where's Hunter? That's the cover-up. They don't want you to know anything about the whistleblower or Hunter. So she's a complete hypocrite. WILLIAMS: I see. So that's -- it's not the case that the President is trying to prevent John Bolton for testifying, hasn't released document -- OK, all right. WATTERS: See you in court. WILLIAMS: There you go. That's the strategy. WATTERS: Hey, that's constitutional. WILLIAMS: That's a slow walk strategy. All right, so Dana -- WATTERS: And one more thing. WILLIAMS: Go ahead. WATTERS: I heard a rumor about the slow walk strategy. The reason Pelosi held the articles was so that all the Senate Democrats running for president could go and do this debate in Iowa and they wouldn't get to miss it. GUTFELD: That makes sense. WILLIAMS: Fascinating. Fascinating. WATTERS: And now they can do it and now they get to the trial. WILLIAMS: Dana, getting back to reality, Dana, one of the things that you have here is that you have Senator Susan Collins of Maine now saying she's working with a small group of Republicans, possibly Murkowski of Alaska, Romney of Utah, maybe Gardener of Colorado, to say to Senator McConnell, there should be witnesses. We want to have witnesses. We want to have a legitimate trial. PERINO: Well, it's just that the game is -- we already know how the game is going to end. So it's -- permission to make a sports analogy. WATTERS: Yes. PERINO: OK. Waiting for these articles of impeachment to go over to the Senate for the trial is like watching the fourth quarter of the Chiefs- Texans game yesterday. They were up by 20 points. The Senate -- the Texans were dragging on and on and you knew how it was going to end. So the commentators are just like -- well, basically, they're just talking about what they're going to have for dinner. Like they're going to have steak. Like, what are they -- what are they're watching on T.V., because we all know what's going to happen. Even if Susan Collins is able to put together these four senators and get some witnesses. We still all know how the game ends. So in some ways, I feel like they should just cut their losses. I thought that what Nancy Pelosi was doing yesterday was signaling that he's impeached for the rest of his life. He's going to be impeached. I don't even need the Senate -- GUTFELD: That was the emotional damage. PERINO: I don't even care about the trial. Once the trial gets going, we all know how it ends anyway. And she got what she wanted? WILLIAMS: You mean, even if -- even if John Bolton comes and testifies, that in fact -- PERINO: I think they should be careful what they wish for. I think if John Bolton testifies, it will help the president. GUTFELD: Yes. WILLIAMS: Well, possibly it would hurt the president. WATTERS: Wishful thinking. WILLIAMS: OK. Shoot him on -- shoot a man on Fifth Avenue, doesn't matter for Republicans, apparently. GUTFELD: What does that mean? WILLIAMS: Coming up next, the White has taken major heat from climate change activists over a tweet, find out more next on THE FIVE. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WATTERS: Brand new examples of climate change insanity. The left freaking out after the White House tweeted this picture of the first snowfall of the year in Washington. Liberals were furious because the photo from January 7th was posted yesterday when temperatures hit 70 degrees in D.C. And the climate hysteria gets even crazier. A climate activist is now calling for the extinction of the human race. Ready? ""50 years ago, I concluded that the best thing for the planet would be a peaceful phase out of human existence. We're causing the extinction of hundreds of thousands of other species. With us gone, I believe ecosystems will be restored and there will be enough of everything. No more fighting over resources."" I mean, he has a point, Greg. GUTFELD: Yes. You know how much I hate people. But I -- you know, and I am -- I hate people and I'm pro-environment. So -- but they have two major problems these climate activists have to deal with. They don't tell the truth, and then the media refuses to fact check them. Instead, the media goes around chasing memes instead of actually fact-checking. If a meme upsets you more than the mayhem in Australia, you got a problem. Right now, you can look at it as Australia. You can hear people on Twitter say blame it on climate change while they arrest hundreds for arson OK. You think the arson story would be the lead story when it comes to climate change? It's not because then you can't blame it on a climate skeptics. You should be questioning why there are so many arsonists. It's because it's due to spectacle. It's just like mass shootings. It's encouraged because of the news. WATTERS: And they don't do the controlled burns like they used to do and clean up all the dry brush. Juan, care to respond to that factual analysis? WILLIAMS: Yes, yes. You know what, I can't believe what's going on in Australia. WATTERS: It's sad. WILLIAMS: And I don't think that arson started it, maybe they're chipping in. GUTFELD: Hundreds of arsonists -- WILLIAMS: Chipping in, but that's not to say that's the origin. But I would say this. The thing about the snow meme, this reminded me -- I couldn't remember it but you and I finally got it together in the break, of Trump with the Medal of Honor where you replace the recipients head with the dog. And I said, you know, people just should be able to trust that the president, the White House, that the Press Secretary is putting out the facts. And instead, you guys said no, you're just being you know -- GUTFELD: It's hilarious. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: Are you alarmed by a tweet saying that it was the first snowfall of all the year that went out on a different day on hot day? GUTFELD: We should love this man for doing this. WILLIAMS: You know what -- you know what alarms me? It's sloppiness. I don't think that Trump meant much by it, I just think that somebody -- by the way, I think it was the White House that put it out, not Trump. And I think it's what you see there's evidence of staff sloppiness and -- PERINO: Maybe it was stuck in the queue. WILLIAMS: I don't -- well, whatever, but it was wrong and -- WATTERS: So it's Scavino's fault. It's Dan Scavino. WILLIAMS: -- again, damages their credibility, Dana. And his credibility can stand much more. PERINO: I don't think a meme about snow is going to damage the credibility. This is one thing I found kind of interesting. So you know those intelligence squared debates. It's like a Lincoln Douglas debate type thing. So there actually having a debate on whether nuclear power should be utilized in order to fight climate change. GUTFELD: Yes. PERINO: So why aren't we having a debate? GUTFELD: No, it's proven. PERINO: It's like why are we -- why do we even need to have a discussion about it. GUTFELD: The cleanest energy. PERINO: Yes. WILLIAMS: Don't tell people in Japan. WATTERS: Yes. Let's not start Gutfeld on a nuclear thing. We'll be here all day. COMPAGNO: The Japan thing -- GUTFELD: (INAUDIBLE) for nuclear reactors. WATTERS: He already solved a little squirrely because he's got a new haircut. Look at him. Can we get a touch out of the hair? GUTFELD: I'm not sure I like it. PERINO: He's trying to look like you. WATTERS: Are you stealing my style, Gutfeld? GUTFELD: You're away for a week, I thought I'd steal your hair. PERINO: I like it. WATTERS: Emily, what do you think about this one whack job here, not anybody at this table, the person that thinks that we should just all kill ourselves off the human race, so the world can live in harmony? COMPAGNO: I mean -- well, I don't know -- even though I work in that any type of airtime, but I have so much to say about everything else. So first of all, the White House did was accurate on the Flickr account. They attributed the photograph, it was correct on the seventh, etc. And this is an another example of the prime freakout that everyone goes through at a tiny error, again, ignoring all the protesters in Iran, ignoring everything else is more import to say that this is some kind of evidence or example of the complete incompetence of Trump. It was just an error. It's no big deal. But it's the fire -- the firestorm from that, that gives it so much weight. Speaking of firestorm, I just learned this weekend at the wombats in Australia are literally actively herding the animals into their fireproof homes because they live in deep dugouts. How cute is that? WATTERS: The wombats save the day. COMPAGNO: And then my final point, yes, is about Elizabeth Warren and her comment that the survival of the planet depends on who wins this presidential election. It belies her participation in the collective incompetence of Congress and the Senate and the public policy that she's been a part of since 1995. Because she is basically saying that everything up until now hasn't worked, or that it was so effective that Trump eradicated at all which last time I checked -- why are you smiling like that? WATTERS: I'm wondering if this is your final point. COMPAGNO: I'm not going to state that anymore. My point -- my point which is that she's basically saying out of both sides of her mouth that the president is so important that everything else fades away even though she crows about balance of power, or that everything up until now has been worthless. So either way, it's drawing back -- WILLIAMS: Wait a second. Wait a second. Can we just -- can we just -- (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: This is wonderful. GUTFELD: I want to know more about the wombat. COMPAGNO: They're really big. They become human-sized, wombats. WILLIAMS: Are you all right? COMPAGNO: Yes. WATTERS: The Queen -- the Queen breaks her silence on Prince Harry and Megxit. All that drama next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) COMPAGNO: Welcome back. Queen Elizabeth finally weighing in on the Megxit drama, and it looks like she is going to give Harry and Meghan what they want. The Queen is speaking out after a high stakes summit with the Royal families today. She says she is entirely supportive of Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan's future plans, but adds that there's more work to be done. And final decisions will be reached in the coming days. OK, Greg. GUTFELD: Yes. COMPAGNO: Meghan says that she will move to L.A. but only after Trump leaves office. And for someone that is this self-proclaimed equalizer of inequities in the world, is this just another example of hypocrisy? GUTFELD: All right, part of me says that she's become gullible to the new wokeness, but my other part of me says that it might not be true. I think what they want is the wealth and fame without being tethered to pomp and circumstance, but they don't realize that it was the pomp and circumstance that brought them the wealth and fame. You know, Royalty was the original celebrity before there was T.V., and movies, and sports. It was -- now, they want to be more famous than this. They want to be George Clooney. They don't want to be -- they don't want to deal with this. But I think you know what, I think they're looking at gift horse in the mouth, and I still can't get the shoes off my peloton bike. So I think -- my point is this. The shoes on the peloton bike problem is more important to me than this story. PERINO: Right. COMPAGNO: Dana, the Queen talked about in that statement, I thought pretty carefully. You know, they've decided to take a step back from the royal family, but they will remain valued members of my family. What do you think about -- PERINO: I think that was actually -- that was a def statement. And I think the question P.R. people are better than the P.R. people that Meghan and Harry hired. They hired the people that dealt with Harvey Weinstein. That wouldn't not necessarily have gone with them. And also I'm surprised it in the statement they still called them Prince and Duchess because like if you want to step back, then I think you relinquish the title. Also, they say one of the problems was in Britain that they had too much media attention. Well, do they think that getting a job in Hollywood and -- is going to change that? It's going to be even more so? Do they think they're going to get more favorable coverage? Maybe for like six months and then watch out. GUTFELD: And it will be controlled. The Royalty, it's controlled. PERINO: Absolutely. GUTFELD: It's not controlled with TMZ. WATTERS: Yes. So they're going to come here, the British tabloids, they're going to follow them to America. PERINO: Yes, totally. WATTERS: So they're going to get U.S. and British press. He's going to have an Alec Baldwin moment. He's going to sock a Paparazzi right in the face. You can see it coming from a mile away. He's also going to have to deal with traffic. He's going to have to deal with Fox News. He's going to have to deal with hecklers. He's not going to have to deal with any of that stuff in Great Britain. GUTFELD: And there's no fox hunting in California. WATTERS: That's true. PERINO: And we're going to bring it back. WATTERS: Yes. Also, Prince Andrew is got to be psyched right now. I mean, he was getting a lot of press, negative press for many weeks and this all of a sudden -- PERINO: Maybe this is not -- WATTERS: -- flows it right up. GUTFELD: Maybe that was the strategy. PERINO: Maybe somebody is threatening the whole thing. WATTERS: You think so? I don't know. PERINO: They were the sacrificial lambs. WATTERS: Maybe because -- I don't know. Besides Trump and football, I like Brexit. I'm now fascinated by it. PERINO: Megxit? WATTERS: Brixit, Megxit, same thing. I like whatever's going on with these roles. I think it's hot. GUTFELD: They're leaving the U.N. COMPAGNO: All right, Juan, what do you make of this multi-national spectacle? WILLIAMS: Well, you know, we talked about this last week and I said I just think Prince Harry still traumatized by what happened to his mother and felt that the Paparazzi, the British tabloids, they just, you know, I think he holds them responsible for his mother's demise. But I think the other part of this for Meghan is I think that she feels like there's been a lot of racism involved in the way the British press, the British tabloids have gone after her -- GUTFELD: Garbage. WILLIAMS: -- raising the letter, her white father. And I think she thinks that going to Canada and to LA, it'll be -- it'll diminish again that race is component of the way the British tabloids have gone after her. She's tired of it. She doesn't think this is a good thing. And I think she knows that her husband is a sympathetic audience given his personality. GUTFELD: It's so pathetic to blame people on because you're having a lousy time, oh, it's racism. I want to see the examples. The proof. COMPAGNO: You guys, the Queen is 93. Why didn't they just wait a couple years and do this after? Like, why break her heart now? Why not wait for Charles' reign? PERINO: I think that they've been planning this for a long time. If you see that last summer Prince Harry talking to Bob Iger of Disney suggests oh, did you know that Meghan is quite interested in doing voiceovers? He's like, oh really? Yes. And so they're trying to work that deal. So they were planning this for quite a long time. WATTERS: Can we just give proper respect right now to Dana who predicted this very moment when these two people were going to move to North America. PERINO: I did. WATTERS: You picked it on the air. PERINO: For my New Year's prediction, I said that they would move to North America. I was very clear, North America. GUTFELD: So you had some inside info, didn't you? PERINO: I didn't. WATTERS: Yes. What did Peter tell you? PERINO: No, I just -- I just read things. Although I just said the Saints are going to win the Super Bowl. WATTERS: You read the tea leaves, right. I predicted the Packers to win the Super Bowl and they're still in it, so -- PERINO: OK, well -- WATTERS: I'm going to pat myself on the back for that. COMPAGNO: There's a lot of predictions to be still confirmed and hadn't. GUTFELD: I predict you're going to go to the break. COMPAGNO: ""ONE MORE THING"" is indeed up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GUTFELD: Time now for ""ONE MORE THING."" I'm going to start first with a serious one. Roger Scruton died at 75 this weekend. He was a brilliant philosopher. He's written over 50 books. He's probably one of the greatest Conservative minds of the last 50, 60 years. In his final years, he was unfairly attacked by the New Statesman, which was a magazine. God, it has nearly ruined his career. And then Douglas Murray helped clear his name. He was just a tremendous person. I would urge you to check out maybe How to be a Conservative and the other book, The Meaning of Conservatism, or the Soul of the World is another book. But there's so many books and he's just an amazing person. He will be missed. Jesse. WATTERS: Well, my one more thing was almost an obituary. Did you hear about the mountain man who was stranded for a month in the Alaskan wilderness. GUTFELD: Yes. WATTERS: His name was Tyson Steele, killer name, a survivalist. He burned down his cabin accidentally when he put some, I guess what was it? I don't know. Cardboard in a wood stove. COMPAGNO: He put cardboard on the fire. WATTERS: Yes. So now 30 days, he's surviving on his own. Here he is speaking with Fox. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TYSON STEELE, STRANDED IN ALASKAN WILDERNESS: I was concerned with saving my dog and saving a few supplies to sleep in, and saving my food. And that was all I could use to survive. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: He's an adventurer. WATTERS: Yes. So it was two degrees Fahrenheit. He survived for 30 days. And wow, it's amazing, amazing story. Thank God he's alright. GUTFELD: We had to pay for that, you know. Dana? PERINO: All right, well if you thought the Royal family feud was getting intense, wait until you see what's happening on Canadian Family Feud. GUTFELD: What? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Name Popeye's favorite food. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Chicken. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh my God. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Show me chicken. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: All right, so the question was, name Popeye's favorite food and she rings in chicken. OK, obviously it's spinach. The question, of course, got her though, $10,000 worth of chicken from Popeyes, of course, the favorite restaurant who really seized the opportunity but honestly -- WATTERS: $10,000 of Popeye's chicken? PERINO: That's a lot of chicken. That's chicken. GUTFELD: I loved it. That is a hell of a chicken dance, though. Her dance was adorable. WATTERS: She thought she had it. GUTFELD: Yes. I am so smart. WILLIAMS: All right. so my family went to a minor league basketball game on Saturday night, the capital city Go-Go of the NBA's G League. And at halftime, four members of my family were selected for the half time dance- off. So take a look. I'm going to let you be the judge. This is Raffi. WATTERS: Oh Raff. Oh yes. COMPAGNO: He's great, Juan. WILLIAMS: All right, here comes my daughter Regan. WATTERS: Oh, Regan. PERINO: Yes, Regan. COMPAGNO: She's pretty good. GUTFELD: What game is this, Juan? WILLIAMS: Next up, Tony. COMPAGNO: Oh, my God. WILLIAMS: And now, here comes my wife Delise. WATTERS: Go, Delise. WILLIAMS: Yes, all right. GUTFELD: Wait, what sport is this? WILLIAMS: Basketball, NBA Basketball. GUTFELD: But wait, there's nobody there. WILLIAMS: No, no. That's the back of the stand. It's an NBA G League game so you don't get a big crowd. But guess who the winner was, folks. Obvious --- WATTERS: Tony. WILLIAMS: No, no, now. Mom, big mom Delise. The crowd went crazy for her. Now, last week, Jesse and Greg said they're going to have a dance-off. We might have to invite them to the Go-Gos. WATTERS: Oh Greg. Let's see what you got, Greg. GUTFELD: I'm not going to -- WATTERS: Let's see what you got. WILLIAMS: Come on, Greg. GUTFELD: You don't want to see what I got. PERINO: I can't dance in front of that crowd. GUTFELD: All right, Emily, it's up to you to finish this show with professionalism. COMPAGNO: And aplomb. GUTFELD: And aplomb, yes. COMPAGNO: Which I shall do. So everybody knows Jimmy Johnson. He's such a famous coach and he helped lead the Dallas Cowboys to two Super Bowl wins in the 90s and also credited with the third win under Barry Switzer in the 90s. But check out when he found out that he is making the NFL Hall of Fame. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're going to be the 328th Hall of Famer -- JIMMY JOHNSON, FORMER FOOTBALL PLAYER: Wow. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- in the Football Hall of Fame. JOHNSON: This is so special to me because when you put in the work that we put in, it's nice to know people appreciate it. WATTERS: What a guy. COMPAGNO: Oh, he's very sweet. WATTERS: Yes. COMPAGNO: Fifteen more seconds. WATTERS: Wow! That was not a plum. WILLIAMS: What? COMPAGNO: One day I will get it right. Congratulations.

108,FOX,"Sorry, media: It looks like Iran hates its own government more than it hates us. Sorry, media. It looks like Iran hates its own government more than it hates us. Instead of burning American flags, what did you see at Sunday's protests in Iran, over its government shooting down that airliner? A bunch of Iranians refusing to act the way our media wished they would. STEPHANIE GRISHAM SAYS CRITICS OF SOLEIMANI STRIKE ARE 'ARGUING SEMANTICS' Demonstrators refused to walk on American and Israeli flags. Instead, they attacked images of Gen. Qassem Soleimani. Yes, as much as they were expected to despise those two countries, it seems they loathe the Revolutionary Guard more. Video also showed government forces firing live ammo at the protestors. Media outrage here is at low ebb — they're still too busy complaining about Trump tweeting mean things about them. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER In Iran, people who speak out endure bullets. In America, the outrage is over memes. Meanwhile, yet another media narrative implodes. We've learned that Trump authorized the killing of Soleimani seven months ago. Wow, talk about impulsive! Erratic! Unstable! Trump only waited seven months to take the guy out. Clearly, he's a maniac crazy with bloodlust. Where's the 25th Amendment when you need it? Once again, the media lie to you about everything. They painted Soleimani as a folk hero. It wasn't true. And, they repeated the lie that Trump was acting irrationally, part of the madman persona they helped fabricate. That wasn't true, either. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Only in America can our media get everything so wrong and still see themselves as the good guys. I guess that's the only way they can look in the mirror without throwing up. Adapted from Greg Gutfeld’s monologue on “The Five” on Jan. 13, 2020. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY GREG GUTFELD"
109,FOX,"After weeks of waiting, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says she plans on sending the articles of impeachment to the Senate next week; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from “The Five,"" January 10, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: So many fast-moving parts. See you live tomorrow at 10 a.m. Eastern. Here is the five.  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everybody. I'm Jesse Watters along with Emily Compagno, Juan Williams, Martha MacCallum, and Greg. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is The Five. President Trump hitting back hard against Democrats criticizing him for taking out Iran's top general. Liberals have been smearing the president for days, claiming he was about to start World War III and that the air strike was just a big distraction from impeachment. The president responding in a big way. Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The radical left Democrats have expressed outrage over the termination.  (CROWD BOOING)  TRUMP: Of this horrible terrorist. We have Bernie and Nancy Pelosi, we have them all. They are all trying to say how dare you take him out that way you? You should come in and tell us what you want to do.  (CROWD BOOING)  TRUMP: You should come in and tell us so that we can call up the fake news that's back there and we can leak it. Can you imagine calling crooked Adam Schiff? He's so crooked. Say, gee, Adam, how are you doing? Listen, we have the world's number one terrorist. We'd like to set up a meeting so we can discuss his execution. Would you be willing to meet?  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: And in an interview with Laura Ingraham President Trump revealing brand-new information about why he ordered the air strike to kill Soleimani.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: Don't the American people have a right to know what specifically was targeted without revealing methods and sources?  TRUMP: Well, I don't think so but we will you that probably it was going to be the embassy in Baghdad.  INGRAHAM: Did you have large scale attacks planned for other embassies. And if those were planned, why can't we reveal that to the American people? Wouldn't that help your case?  TRUMP: I can reveal that I believe it would have been four embassies.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Wow.  WATTERS: So, Martha, imagine if President Trump doesn't give the order to take him out and then weeks later our embassies are under fire. It's like a dereliction of duty. He has to take that action.  MACCALLUM: You know, I think that the debate that's going on is actually quite American and quite understandable in terms of people wanting to know what the intelligence was. That -- that battle for information.  WATTERS: Sure.  MACCALLUM: And as Laura, you know, ask there, people it might be helpful to the president's case. And I do think that's why the president has, you know, over the past 48 hours has given a little bit more information about what he says. And he was careful there to say we believe that it could have been four embassies that were taken out. But my mind goes back to the Clinton years - -  WATTERS: Yes.  MACCALLUM: -- and the assessment of the Clinton years. And I remember interviewing an FBI or overseas operative at one point who told me a story about when they had Bin Laden in their sights.  WATTERS: Right.  MACCALLUM: And that, you know, there was all this back and forth between the State Department and the White House. And they had been working very hard on getting him within their scope quite literally and then were given the order to pull out. OK? So, these are decisions that only the president of the United States can make. When you are told, sir, we have a target of opportunity, we have a window to do this. And only Gina Haspel, you know, probably knows the full details about what happened there. Do you want to take the shot or not?  WATTERS: Yes. And you have to take the kill shot, right, Greg?  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: I don't know, I am kind of a peaceful guy, Jesse.  WATTERS: Yes, you are, Greg.  GUTFELD: I have a theory that's going to blow your mind about the media freak out --  WATTERS: Really?  GUTFELD: -- after this whole event. The Times today and right so, said that no -- there is no one president has used force less than Donald Trump since the Carter era. So, think about that. So, he is the most anti-war leader in four decades. So that explains the hysterical response that you're seeing in the media because they have to capitalize on it because it's a rare event. It doesn't happen very often. So, this is your chance to take your shot. It reminds me -- may I use an analogy -- of when once in a while, maybe once a year my wife might get a little tipsy. That is the only time I can criticize her for drinking for the whole year. So, I seize on that opportunity and say, my God, look at you. Look at you. Because she does that to me almost once a week. So, it's a -- this is the point. That Trump with this war like behavior is so rare that the media has to jump for it and scream bloody murder. And the problem that they have is they are currently living in the prism of two ideas. It's either nothing or war. Right? We do nothing or it's World War III. That's how they see it. Now if that were the case, it would be slaves or Genghis Khan. But Trump, like a sensible person, he operates in the turf between those two prisms and finds a decisive action that creates a positive outcome that is incredibly non-war-like.  WATTERS: And, Juan, you have to admit we are at a positive outcome right now. No U.S. casualties. It looks like there has been de-escalation and probably one of the most evil generals in our lifetime has been taken out.  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: I agree with the first thing that you said. I'm glad that we've seen de-escalation. Everything seems calm for the moment, so I'm very happy. I don't want us to go into war. But I think there are two ideas here, maybe three. Because Greg says, you know what, he is the least violent in terms of using military action of any president.  GUTFELD: The fact by the New York Times.  WILLIAMS: Right. But I would say this to you.  GUTFELD: Yes.  WILLIAMS: By the way, I'm glad to hear you think so much of the times.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: David Rush.  WILLIAMS: All right. All right. But I think that part of the reason for the concern is it seems like such an intemperate sort of off-the-cuff action. We don't know why he did it. We don't know if this is evidence of suddenly saying why not? We know that the Pentagon was shocked that he accepted that option.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: They gave him that. They offered that option.  WILLIAMS: They gave him the option, but no -- they've offered that option to President Bush to President Obama.  GUTFELD: And trump said yes. Don't give him the option if you don't want him to do it.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Wait, wait. Wait a minute. He's supposed to be an adult.  GUTFELD: Yes.  WILLIAMS: There are lots of -- there are lots of options that you and I say no to every day that are good too.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Yes.  WATTERS: But the Pentagon gave the option.  WILLIAMS: But here's the real point that I'd like to make. You have this very ugly situation where the president and people like Doug Collins, the congressman from Georgia go after the Democrat. You are supporting Soleimani. You think that that guy wasn't a terrorist, wasn't a bad guy. Hey, President Trump, you can have two thoughts. H's a bad guy and he was killing people. He's not up to 9/11 as Vice President Pence was charging. But he can be a bad guy. And it can be a bad idea to go out and kill him because we don't know the consequences.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: But Juan, now that we do know the consequences.  WILLIAMS: We don't.  WATTERS: And the consequences at this moment has been exactly the opposite, Emily, of what the left predicted. As we heard the left predicted World War III --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: The story is not over.  WATTERS: -- the left predicted World War and we're not in World War III.  WILLIAMS: The story is not over.  WATTERS: So that is the point, the left was --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Gosh. There you go.  WATTERS: -- used to think the situation. And now they are afraid to --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: You are spiking the ball before you cross the line.  WATTERS: No casualties, Juan.  WILLIAMS: Gosh.  EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, I think part of this articulation of fear is exactly what that regime of terror wants us to do. Which is, refrain from responding in kind with the defensive, decisive actions for fear of more terroristic actions. Look, this isn't a new war on Iran. This is a new chapter on their on-going war against us for the last 40 years. And we, and the globe, have been bullied frankly and to treating them like a country and they're not. It's a cause. It has been a cause this entire time. They don't deserve the respect or the adherence to structure that countries do because that's not them. And you know, people argue and the Democrats have been saying this is the escalation. No, no, no. The escalation came from Iran with their steady and increased targeted attacks on us and oil production fields and the loss of American life. Exactly. We exercise restraint by not responding in kind especially after that drone attack. And you know, when you talk about the battle for information, absolutely that that should always be something -- we should always expect that our intelligence community is being forthright. But I also think the arguments have been both ways in that. Up until now the intelligence community is infallible, right? With the Mueller report? And then all of sudden why now with Iran when they should trust them to be one step ahead. All of a sudden, they've called into question and now that ascendency of escalation is all of a sudden no, no, no, it's us that escalated it?  WATTERS: Well, that's an interesting point. Because there is another very weird wrinkle that you are seeing in this story as the Iranians have now, I guess, accidentally we think shot down this Ukraine airliner. Here's what Democrat Congresswoman Speier had to say blaming Trump.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  REP. JACKIE SPEIER (D-CA): If what is being projected is true, this is yet another example of collateral damage from the actions that have been taken in a provocative way by the president of the United States. But for the escalation in the actions taken by Iran, there would not be 176 people dead today. It all emanate -- emanates from the killing of Soleimani.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WATTERS: Wow. Martha, I can't explain that one.  MACCALLUM: I mean, I think that's really reckless talk. This was a missile that was made by Russians.  WATTERS: Yes.  MACCALLUM: It was sent into the sky by Iranians by all the intelligence that we have so far. And it's a huge strategy that 176 people are dead. I also just want to point out that this happened in 1988 as well and it was our fault in that situation. And Khomeini mentioned that. You know, strangely, eerily right before all of this happened. There was a missile that we took -- a missile of ours that took down a civilian plane and we claimed responsibility right after that in 1988. So, this is a tragic situation. But I think to put the blame on President Trump when it's an Iranian missile an Iranian decision to send it up is really, really, at the very least, just in really bad taste.  GUTFELD: I mean, the story of the Middle East is the story of collateral damage.  MACCALLUM: Yes.  GUTFELD: We've watched decades and decades and decades of innocent human suffering. Iran behind a lot of with especially with their militias and what they are doing in different countries. They've turned that region into one big game of whack a mole. To describe that we're somehow responsible to this. That is -- imagine if you had a child who was bullied every and finally punched the bully. Right? And it's somehow, it's your kid's fault. It's your kid's fault for hurting him. No, if that kid -- if that kid did something after he got beaten up, that's on him.  WATTERS: Right.  GUTFELD: And it is -- it's this in the modern era of Trump derangement you have people saying the dumbest things. And it is an illness. And we are going to look back on this we are going to go -- they are going to be wondering what they were thinking. She should wonder what she's thinking.  COMPAGNO: That missile attack does not say anything about Trump's presidency. It only speaks to Iran's incompetence. We know when their anti- aircraft radar is on and it was on during that time because it was in the midst of their missile attack on us. And they were trigger happy. They saw an aircraft that they didn't have the identity for and instead of verifying and shooting second, they shot first. It is their -- it is their bad and not us. And by the way, Soleimani used to travel on huge planes surrounded by hundreds of civilians for that collateral damage --  GUTFELD: Yes.  COMPAGNO: -- to protect himself. And that is why our window is so --  (CROSSTALK)  MACCALLUM: That's why he took the airport.  COMPAGNO: That's why our window of availability for him was so short.  WATTERS: Yes  COMPAGNO: So that collateral damage that's their process.  WATTERS: Yes.  COMPAGNO: That's not ours.  WATTERS: The United States goes out of its way to make sure civilians are not affected. I mean, that's why terrorists they hide in churches, they hide in mosques. They hide everywhere. Schools. And we always do the best we can not to target civilians. It's the exact opposite of what the Iranians so.  WILLIAMS: Well, I think that Martha made a point. Sometimes in the course of military action that mistakes happen. Tragic mistakes. But I think you have to look at the situation this way. Jesse, we know that the administration apparently was targeting several Iranian officials. And they didn't have success in hitting some of those officials. They got Soleimani. But they didn't get the rest of them. And specific one. So, we don't know the extent of this. We still don't know the justification for what the action --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: So now you are mad they didn't get more?  WILLIAMS: No.  GUTFELD: You were mad that they got one.  WILLIAMS: I didn't know. I don't know, Greg. We don't know. We, as the American people --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: But be consistent.  WILLIAMS: -- aren't involved in a legitimate discussion of --  GUTFELD: Yes.  WILLIAMS: -- was this justified? The consequences that are coming? I don't blame the U.S. for the shooting down of that plane. As you said, Jesse, that's the mistake made by what happened by the Iranians.  WATTERS: Right.  WILLIAMS: But we should know as Americans as active citizens of this democracy why happened and why that action was taken.  WATTERS: Yes. And if you want to know more about that watch Laura Ingraham, Juan today 10 o'clock.  WILLIAMS: Eyeballs.  WATTERS: The president is going to explain a lot of thinking.  WILLIAMS: Eyeballs.  WATTERS: All right. Next, President Trump unleashes a blistering attack on the Democrats as he prepares for impeachment. More on that next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  MACCALLUM: So, after weeks of waiting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says that she does plan on sending the articles of impeachment to the Senate next week. President Trump says he is ready for a fight. Watch this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: By the way, did you see I did nothing wrong. They even don't know what the hell is going on. In fact, it's so weak, she doesn't want to put in the articles, it's so weak. They are so pathetic. We could have them lined up, Adam. You little pencil neck.  (APPLAUSE)  TRUMP: Nine inches. He buys the smallest shirt collar you can get, and it's loose. I said we have to have where is Hunter as a witness? I said where is Hunter. I said that's his first name. I have now made his first name where's. Where's Hunter?  (END VIDEO CLIP)  MACCALLUM: All right. So, let's unpack that a little bit from last night. Juan, let me start with you. Just in terms of Nancy Pelosi turning over these articles of impeachment next week. Do you think that she regrets the path that she took here because this thing is, at least at this point, unless there's some surprises, sure to die in the Senate?  WILLIAMS: Yes. But I agree with you. I don't think that he is going to be convicted and removed from office. But in fact, what she did was she slowed down this process and I think there are lots of people on the Republican side who wanted this to be a quick event, quick acquittal, get it out --  (CROSSTALK)  MACCALLUM: No, the Democrats wanted it to be super quick.  WILLIAMS: No.  MACCALLUM: Remember, they said it's such a threat of the president --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: No. That was a --  MACCALLUM: -- doing it again that that's why we can't take the time to go through the legal process for John Bolton and Mick Mulvaney.  WILLIAMS: No.  MACCALLUM: Well, that's what they said.  WILLIAMS: No, that's what they said because it was contrary to the White House strategy which was to slow walk this thing, get it into courts and never have come to any impeachment. So, they had -- they succeeded on three levels, Martha, here. One is they made President Trump wait and they prose attention to fall on moderate Republicans in the Senate with regard to whether or not they will support the idea of bringing people like John Bolton who had firsthand knowledge of what took place before them. And, also, I think, you know, if you saw the president last night at the rally, I don't think that he is jumping up and down and screaming about pencil neck -- how crazy. If he wasn't worried about impeachment. He doesn't like being impeached. He thinks this is a big asterisk on his presidency and a negative going into reelection.  GUTFELD: But in itself is an emotional strategy on the Democrat's part. We made him feel bad. We knew we won't get him out. But damn, we made him feel bad. I mean, think about that's the -- this whole thing was an emotional exercise to heal the bitter soul. I feel like a friend who gave really good advice that went ignored. I told the Democrats here on this show. I said this. You know how the movie is going to end. He's not getting impeached. His numbers are going to go up and your numbers are going to go down. And that's exactly what happened but they didn't listen. Because their emotional framework prevented them from seeing the facts. Now the Democrats are like Iran. Right? They need operation saving face to get out of a mess that that created. Right. They need the same equivalent of shooting bombs into the air into a field so that they can leave this humiliating mess with at least you know, maybe some minimal self-respect left.  MACCALLUM: You know, Trey Gowdy was on last night with Hannity. And he was talking about how he thinks all of this, Jesse, is about flipping the Senate. That that is sort of the goal at this point to sort of threw this war of attrition and barrage of information to try to make races a lot tougher for people like Corey Gardner and Susan Collins.  WATTERS: Well, that failed and Juan's analysis is --  (CROSSTALK)  MACCALLUM: We don't know yet. And that will be determined in the fall.  WATTERS: It's dead wrong. It's dead wrong. Because if you look at the Democrats were saying, Nancy, send them over right now. Feinstein said it. Angus King said it. It was Democrats in the House and the Senate was like, hurry this thing up, guys. I don't think any moderate Republicans in the Senate felt any pressure from Nancy or the media and are worried about re-election. That might have been the strategy but that strategy has failed. During the election in nine months or whatever is going to be, impeachment is not going to be a big play.  WILLIAMS: No.  WATTERS: They are going to be talking about the economy. They are going to talk about Iran and whatever else is going to happen.  WILLIAMS: Yes.  WATTERS: This thing made Pelosi look weak. She said she had leverage that she never had. She said she was going to squeeze concessions and McConnell. She got no concessions. McConnell never caved. She ended up caving. She ended up holding these articles for two weeks and lost the momentum of impeachment and made herself look less powerful because she just sat there blowing in the wind. Accomplished nothing that she promised. And now this thing is just a foregone conclusion. Not one Republican is going to vote against it. In fact, two to three Senate Democrats are going to vote with Republicans.  MACCALLUM: Well, we'll see if they can drag it into the election phase. Because I think you're right in terms of how much the American people are putting this as a priority when it comes to election time. But looking forward to the election, Emily, in terms of, you know, the where's Hunter and this the Hunter Biden stuff and the lock her up also kind of resurfaced last night. Do you that's wise?  COMPAGNO: Well, I think for the debates, I mean, everyone will tune in to watch it no matter this will be absolutely entertaining. And I think it's wise. It rallies his base, frankly. But Trey Gowdy he has a great point. That the strategy, first of all, it's totally transparent and obviously an impeachment won't work. But the strategy is to neuter the second term which were his language, right? So, to prevent any type of judicial appointments, the SCOTUS justice appointment. And I think the embodiment of how transparent the strategy was on the left is congressman Adam Smith yesterday, he is the twelfth-term member, he is the chair of the House Armed Services Committee and he went on CNN and was like, yes, it's time to pass along the articles of impeachment. Immediately issued a retraction. I'm sorry, I misspoke. Clearly, Pelosi called him. Get in line. The lemmings are so obvious. And that's why all the moderates that were -- that Trump is buying for, like you said, the Senate -- the Senate races aren't -- there is going to be no question whatsoever.  WATTERS: I just can't believe the Democrats didn't listen to Greg.  GUTFELD: Yes.  WATTERS: I mean, how could they not?  GUTFELD: Yes. And it's --  (CROSSTALK)  MACCALLUM: Usually their bible.  GUTFELD: And I'm here to help, Democrats.  WATTERS: Yes. Do whatever you said.  MACCALLUM: All right. Coming up, Elizabeth Warren mocked after busting out her dance moves on the campaign trail. Plus, why she is now offering dating tips.  GUTFELD: Yes.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WILLIAMS: Welcome back. Elizabeth Warren really does have a plan for everything. The 2020 Democrat offering now of dating advice.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Give him up. You're too good for him. If he wants to go silent, let him go. He is not the one for you. Guys who do that, you are better than that.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: What did he do?  WILLIAMS: Plus, the internet mocking Senator Warren after she showed off these dance moves.  (MUSIC PLAYING)  COMPAGNO: God.  WILLIAMS: Emily, do you want to show her how to do it?  COMPAGNO: No. Look, you guys know how I feel like about dance shaming. Others I don't. And I actually thought right there it was cute. She was having a ball. That's awesome. Right? It's awkward but it's awesome. But the dating thing I feel like that's the whole point where what matters is being real over being down or woke or cool. And she didn't even get it right because the guy had already ghosted the girl and she was like, break up with him, honey. And it was like, no, he already did. He already ghosted her. But she doesn't know what that meant.  WILLIAMS: OK. So, for an old man, here's my stuff, Jesse.  GUTFELD: I don't know what she's --  (CROSSTALK)  MACCALLUM: She's like, I don't why he's spooking, you know, but you should get rid of him. Is that scary?  WILLIAMS: But wait a second, Martha. Isn't she saying to the young woman, forget that guy?  MACCALLUM: This is so ridiculous.  WILLIAMS: OK.  MACCALLUM: I mean, honestly, Juan, can you imagine someone asking like Dwight Eisenhower, for example, like, do you think I should break up with my boyfriend Mr. Eisenhower? I mean, General Eisenhower. I mean, it's just so ridiculous. This just started with boxers and briefs and MTV and asking Bill Clinton like why do -- why is it all so personal and touchy feely. Why do we care about the human side of this? I don't get it. I don't care. I don't know why people need a presidential candidate to be relatable and their best friend. I mean, run the country. That's what I'm concerned about. So.  WILLIAMS: Come on.  GUTFELD: But do you --  (CROSSTALK)  MACCALLUM: No, I'm serious. Do you care about this stuff from these people?  WILLIAMS: No, look, let me just tell you something. I'm of your school by the way but I think we're wrong. Because I think people -- it's less policy and more person. They want to have somebody they can relate to --  (CROSSTALK)  MACCALLUM: Because that matter?  WILLIAMS: -- to someone that they feel that guy or that woman, I feel like them.  (CROSSTALK)  MACCALLUM: My God. I just want someone who runs the country and does a really good job.  WILLIAMS: Or I'd want to have a beer with, remember Bush? I want to have a beer with that guy.  MACCALLUM: I think you're right that a lot of people care about it. I just think we need to kind of as a nation ask ourselves if we are really prioritizing the right things when we're looking at these candidates.  GUTFELD: I think Trump has forced everybody into discovering their authenticity even if you're like Liz, and you have none. Remember her entire life is forged upon a fraud, right? Her -- she stole other people's heritage in order to get ahead. So now she's got to work backwards and figure out oh, I'll give you dating advice or I'll dance. By the way, dancing, that dancing thing isn't her fault. They got to stop playing -- they got to stop playing Respect, OK. It's the most overplayed song in campaign events. Play songs that you can't dance to, like, what does Trump do? You Can't Always Get What You Want, right? You can't dance to it. And it's perfect. You goes out there and just a big punch in the gut to the left, because you can't always get what you want. Pick songs that you can't dance to, and then you don't feel like dancing. But every time you play Respect, it's the wedding song.  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Real quick, Jesse. Isn't it the case that we say, forget the Twitter mob? At this table, we say the Twitter mob don't reflect what most Americans think anyway.  JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, Greg can't dance at all.  GUTFELD: How do you know that?  WATTERS: I understand why you're siding with Cuomo.  GUTFELD: You've never seen me dance.  WATTERS: Because you don't dance.  GUTFELD: That's true.  WATTERS: Because you can't dance.  GUTFELD: I'm such a good dancer that I keep secret.  WATTERS: So you're saying you don't dance because you're so good, you don't want anybody to see.  GUTFELD: I could dance you into the grave.  MACCALLUM: I think we have a little competition brewing here. I'd like to see that.  WATTERS: He won't do it. He won't do it because he's too good.  GUTFELD: I'm so good, it's -- your eyes don't deserve this.  WILLIAMS: All right. All right.  GUTFELD: Maybe Lou Dobbs. If Lou Dobbs ask me, I will do it.  WILLIAMS: If he pumps your gas for. All right, more fallout in the Megxit drama. The ""FASTER SEVEN"" is coming at you next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  COMPAGNO: All right, welcome back. Time for the ""FASTEST SEVEN."" First up, the fallout from Megxit continues. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle could be punished for defying the Queen. And Oprah Winfrey has clarified that she had nothing to do with their decision to step back from the Royal family after it was reported that she helped advise them on the move. Juan, what are your thoughts on this pressing global matter?  WILLIAMS: I'm puzzled. I don't know what to make of it. But I will say this, I think Harry, after his mother's death and the way that the media had just attacked her, I think he's traumatized. And so for him, I think if his wife, if Meghan Markle says, you know, I'm getting tired of all these paparazzi people and all the rumors and publishing the letter to my dad, I think he's -- you know what, I think he's fifth in line, Emily.  MACCALLUM: Sixth.  COMPAGNO: Seventh.  WILLIAMS: Seventh?  GUTFELD: I'm 13th.  WILLIAMS: You're 13th. Greg is 13th. He's like, well, you know, why am I putting my families through this? I don't need it.  COMPAGNO: Right.  GUTFELD: Way to bring it down, Juan.  WATTERS: I think they showed a lot of disrespect to the Queen. And, you know, I respect the Queen a lot, and I think that she should be respected. And I think what they did was (INAUDIBLE).  MACCALLUM: Oh my gosh. This is so bad.  WATTERS: The other thing I'd like to say is if I was born -- if I was born to a royal family like this, or if I married into a royal family like this, the last thing I would do would be leave. I would stay with my (INAUDIBLE) ordering people around all day. I have the time of my life. What are they thinking? What are they thinking?  COMPAGNO: What do you think?  MACCALLUM: I mean, you know, I'm going -- like I'm turning into this. I'm going back to my Elizabeth Warren theory. It's like, it doesn't really matter how you feel, right? It's all about your duty to your country. I mean, the Queen, she was a young woman when she became queen and she said, my whole life, whether it be short or long will be devoted to this country and to serving my country. All these young men serve in the military in the member -- in the royal family. And you know, so he's just walking away from all that. I can't help but think and I have absolutely zero inside information. I'm not Oprah, I don't talk to them about this, but I think he's going to regret this. I really do.  COMPAGNO: Greg, what do you think?  GUTFELD: Here's the thing that really bugs me. Ever since Brexit, we've been adding this exit thing. Megxit sounds like a dermatological issue. I have a Megxit on my butt. It needs to be stopped. Megxit sounds disgusting. All right, I've already reached out to the Royal family and have offered myself as a surrogate to replace these ungrateful brats. I lived in London for like three years. I wrote a book on England. I'm an expert. I love black pudding, I hang out in the pub. I will not be like Prince Andrew and corner teenagers at a party. I will be the best -- I will be the prince you'll never had.  MACCALLUM: That's like a funny movie.  GUTFELD: It is.  MACCALLUM: Greg Gutfeld becomes a member of the Royal family.  GUTFELD: I think it would be great.  COMPAGNO: It could be the new reality show. I feel like it's a lost opportunity for them to make that monarchy, this new progressive diverse chapter. And instead, they just checked out really early. I mean, they've been there for five seconds.  MACCALLUM: Give it a chance, for God's sake.  WATTERS: I have a question about Royal protocol. So if we happen to run into Harry and Meghan in the city here, in a club, or at a restaurant, do we have to then bow or curtsy?  COMPAGNO: Not you. You're not a U.K. subject.  WATTERS: Can we just shake hands and be like, what's up?  COMPAGNO: You're not a British citizen or a U.K. surrogate.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: I wanted to know.  WILLIAMS: We were established in defiance of monarch. We don't want monarch Trump.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Although, then you just tell me monarch Trump agreed with her?  GUTFELD: Always has to put Trump into this.  WILLIAMS: No, he brought it up. I didn't bring it up.  WATTERS: I said nothing like that.  COMPAGNO: All right, all right. Now, next topic, nanny state alert. A new bill in Vermont would ban cell phones for people under the age of 21. And it would punish offenders with $1,000 fine and up to a year in prison. The lawmaker behind the push, however, admitting that it is more about making a point, but likely a horrible solution to an articulable problem, which is young people distractedly driving and then getting injured. But what a ridiculous law, right?  WILLIAMS: But it's not just young people. Everybody does it.  COMPAGNO: But this law is for those under 21.  WILLIAMS: That's why I think it's unfair. I mean, look, I do worry that I think it has an impact on the formation of their brain. I think they just get locked in. But you got to have some scientific backup. This makes it out to be like cell phones or alcohol or tobacco, and we don't know that.  GUTFELD: Well, I'll tell you right now. There's a statistics for driving right now, texting and driving accidents and fatalities are overtaking drunk driving. However, you -- banning things to make a point never works. You can ban things like murder and incest, the obvious things, but the behavior, this behavior itself is not inherently bad. It's the extensions of the behavior which are destructive. And so, you have to focus -- you have to make texting and driving as punishing -- as punishable as drunk driving --  WILLIAMS: For everyone.  GUTFELD: Yes, for everybody, absolutely.  WILLIAMS: For everyone.  MACCALLUM: I think what's going to -- I don't think that the government should have the say over this matter, but I do think it's going to come from families. And I predict that you're going to have sort of enclaves that are tech-free. You know, if you want to raise your kids in this neighborhood, and they're going to go to these schools, nobody is going to have a cell phone, nobody's going to have an iPad until they're 17, 18, or whatever they decide. But I think you will see sort of a cropping up of communities that are thinking they are going along these lines of banding tech for kids.  COMPAGNO: Wait, Martha, have you heard about the community on the East Coast that is totally radio frequency free?  MACCALLUM: No.  COMPAGNO: And they do that.  GUTFELD: They're called the Amish.  MACCALLUM: Well, you know what --  COMPAGNO: It exists. It exists, but they're real weird.  WILLIAMS: Radiofrequency?  COMPAGNO: It's like they're off the grid.  WILLIAMS: What are you talking about? They don't listen to the radio?  COMPAGNO: It's basically the movie Armageddon but on the East Coast.  MACCALLUM: I'm just talking about sort of like an extension of like the homeschooling idea of community where people say like we're not doing -- and actually there's their schools like this in California where a lot of the tech guy, women, their kids are going to schools that don't allow any technology until they're like 10 or 11.  WATTERS: Total hypocrites. This law is like impeachment. They did it to make a point and they knew it was never going to happen.  GUTFELD: Yep. There you go.  MACCALLUM: That's a good point. Quite well taken.  COMPAGNO: All right, the world's top athletes are gearing up for the 2020 Olympics Summer Games in Tokyo. They'll have to sleep however on these recyclable beds made out of cardboard. It's an effort to reduce the games carbon footprint and organizers say it is stronger than wood. Look, if I trust anyone in the world, it's the Japanese to pull this up. I'm sure they're more comfortable than my bed at home.  WATTERS: Really?  COMPAGNO: Yes.  WATTERS: It's made of wood.  MACCALLUM: What's wrong with them?  COMPAGNO: All bed -- all bed --  WATTERS: Your bed is more comfortable than a piece of cardboard, Emily.  COMPAGNO: I would say -- but it's not -- it's not -- there is there a mattress too. I'm just saying, for anyone to demonstrate a decreased carbon footprint and making it awesome --  GUTFELD: This is --  COMPAGNO: I trust -- I trust the Japanese doing it.  GUTFELD: This is the biggest problem the Olympics are facing. I never look for the problems that people try to solve because that's usually virtue signaling. Think about the problems that they're not trying to solve. The issues that they're going to come up now with, again, with more drugs, and all the gender stuff that's going on where you're having men who are now -- who are now women participating against women. That's the stuff you're going to have to be dealing with in the future. Not cut your carbon footprint.  WATTERS: And you know who's not going to be sleeping on these beds, the Russians. Didn't they get banned for the Olympics?  GUTFELD: Yes, they're banned.  WATTERS: That's right, bunch of dope heads. They got caught red-handed. Get it, red-handed?  GUTFELD: Oh, very funny. Jesse is back and better than ever.  WATTERS: It's because I didn't look at a cell phone for 10 days.  GUTFELD: That's true.  MACCALLUM: See, that makes such a difference in your life.  WATTERS: It was a little community.  GUTFELD: By the way, you went to Mexico, didn't you?  WATTERS: I did.  GUTFELD: I guess that wall didn't matter then.  WATTERS: I flew right over it.  MACCALLUM: Oh boy.  COMPAGNO: Stay right there, you guys. ""FAN MAIL FRIDAY"" is coming up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: Yes, ""FAN MAIL FRIDAY,"" answering your questions. First one, from Mary Y. Why not? What do you most hate to shop for, Martha?  MACCALLUM: Food.  GUTFELD: Food, really?  MACCALLUM: Yes. I don't like it because, you know, then you have like -- I ended up with way more than I wanted, and like the bags really heavy. Then you get home, we got to put everything away.  GUTFELD: Oh yes, I hate that too.  WATTERS: I love shopping for food.  MACCALLUM: You do?  WATTERS: You know what I do, Martha. You don't have to carry the bags. You can send it to your apartment.  MACCALLUM: I don't do that. Yes. I load it in the car and bring it home.  WATTERS: Sometimes the bags get a little heavy for me and it hurts my hands.  MACCALLUM: Yes, and they --  WATTERS: And they hurt my shoulders and then I have to take a break on the way home, so I'll just ship them to the apartment.  GUTFELD: I just shove a T-bone in my pants leave. What do you -- Juan, what do you not like to shop for?  WILLIAMS: Well, I think it just appeals to my anxieties to go car shopping.  GUTFELD: Oh, I hate it. Yes.  WILLIAMS: You know, because I have to -- I always think somebody else is getting a better deal on this car. And then secondly, I think, why did I pick this car? I should have waited and got that car or they're selling me -- there's so much marketing and stuff.  GUTFELD: Yes, I know. What about you, Emily?  COMPAGNO: I think I genuinely like shopping for everything unless it's something boring like oh, I have to get this like hardware item and then I just hang out in the paint department and something more exciting.  GUTFELD: Yes.  COMPAGNO: I'll bring my dog which is great.  GUTFELD: Yes, the paint department smells awesome. If there's no ventilation, it's a cheap high, Jesse.  WATTERS: I go there on a Friday night.  GUTFELD: Yes, exactly, exactly. It is cheaper than any bar.  COMPAGNO: I like shopping.  GUTFELD: You know what, I had a buy this week was -- that I lost an hour. I had to buy checks. Don't you -- like when you run out of checks --  COMPAGNO: Don't you order them online?  GUTFELD: No, I called my bank and they froze my account because I couldn't predict my transaction. They go, what was your last transaction? I don't know.  WATTERS: Just go on your phone and you can see your last transaction.  GUTFELD: I don't have that on my phone.  MACCALLUM: I don't have that either.  WATTERS: You don't have an app on your bank account.  GUTFELD: TD Bank, I'm still mad at TD Bank. And also, you can't --  WATTERS: Do you still go to the teller to make --  GUTFELD: You can't -- you can't close your bank because you have all these direct deposits and withdrawals. It drives me crazy. All right, Sherri D. says what noise drives you crazy, Jesse?  WATTERS: Well, I have very sensitive ears. I have very small ears and very tiny eardrums.  GUTFELD: What?  WATTERS: The loudest noise will really -- it'll just shatter my hearing.  GUTFELD: How do you do your show?  WATTERS: What? If a siren, a siren at really close range --  GUTFELD: Should we ban -- should we ban sirens? Screw the sick and the -- and the people that are in harm's way?  WATTERS: No, we're not going to go that far.  MACCALLUM: Just get around more quietly maybe.  GUTFELD: Did you just turn that --  WATTERS: Turn the siren down a little.  GUTFELD: Juan.  WILLIAMS: I mean, you know, so in New York in the middle of the night, man these garbage truck, especially when they're backing up. What are you doing? What are you doing?  GUTFELD: They're to get your garbage.  WILLIAMS: You know, another thing, I don't -- well, yes they are, but they wanted to do it when I'm trying to sleep. And then they -- people who leave their turn signal on and you're in the car and you want to say hey, what about your -- and you think, no, because that's like backseat driving if I'm telling them that their turn signal are going like --  COMPAGNO: You're right.  GUTFELD: Emily.  COMPAGNO: There's a long list but definitely construction noises, also other people's cell phones, other people on the phone, any type of noise in the car --  GUTFELD: Human beings.  COMPAGNO: Other people --  GUTFELD: It's actually noise if -- any sound from a human being makes me sick to my stomach, Martha.  MACCALLUM: In my old apartment in New York, we had radiators. And when the heat would start coming through, it sounded like someone was slamming it with a hammer.  (CROSSTALK)  MACCALLUM: I was like, oh my God.  GUTFELD: I love that sound.  MACCALLUM: You do? I hate that sound.  GUTFELD: Yes, I like that sound. It's kind of neat especially if you're alone. Like a little ghost with you.  MACCALLUM: It's kind of neat in a way but it's kind of annoying.  GUTFELD: You know what I hate? I hate the sound of other people's music because it's not good.  MACCALLUM: Because you didn't choose it.  GUTFELD: I didn't choose it. Other people's music is terrible.  MACCALLUM: I know what you mean. I know exactly what you mean.  GUTFELD: It's terrible. It's terrible because everybody listens to the same crap. I should stop now.  WILLIAMS: Yes. Imagine how we feel about your music.  GUTFELD: ""ONE MORE THING"" is up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WATTERS: It's time for ""ONE MORE THING."" And the reason I haven't been here for a few days is because Emma and I got married. There's the ring. Here we are.  COMPAGNO: Congratulations.  WATTERS: There we in Naples, Florida. She looks beautiful.  COMPAGNO: Beautiful.  WATTERS: Everybody keeps on saying I've out kicked my coverage. I'm just going to leave that one alone, but it was a beautiful ceremony. My daughter has participated, my friends and family in there. And Greg, was there, showed up a little late.  MACCALLUM: I guess he wasn't dancing.  WATTERS: He didn't quite make it on time and didn't dance. We can confirm that Greg does not dance.  GUTFELD: The invite is at 5:30 p.m. and I was outside looking down the balcony and I see the wedding happening. And I'm looking, it's 5:15. And then my wife is like, what's going on? I go, the wedding is happening. And we ran down and we missed half the wedding. And I had to sit in the back, me and Elena had to sit in the back. And then you guys walk out and walk right towards us, and it was the most embarrassing thing.  WATTERS: Yes, we did that on purpose.  MACCALLUM: Did you lie about what time the ceremony was going to start?  WATTERS: Yes, we had to cheat him. We only -- Greg only got one invite, everybody else got a different invite. So I'm on ""HANNITY"" tonight also 9:00 p.m. Check that out. And then ""WATTERS WORLD"" this weekend, we have exclusive photos of Bill Clinton in Jeffrey Epstein's private jet, so check that out. Greg.  GUTFELD: All right, tomorrow night, the ""GREG GUTFELD SHOW,"" Saturday 10:00 p.m. We have Pete Hegseth, Joe Machi, Kat Timpf, Tyrus. That's January 11th, 10:00 p.m. Watch it. Now, it's time for this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Greg's memory of Marianne.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  MACCALLUM: I like those lines.  GUTFELD: Marianne Williamson has suspended her candidacy. So let's look back fondly at some of her greatest moments. I love you, Marianne.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  MARIANNE WILLIAMSON (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The Prime Minister of New Zealand, who said that her goal is make New Zealand a place where it's the best place in the world for a child to grow up. And I will tell a girlfriend you are so on.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you have a pet?  WILLIAMSON: Do I have a pet? I have a cat. If you think any of this wonkiness is going to deal with this dark psychic force. Mr. President, if you're listening, I'm going to harness love for political purposes. I will meet you on that field. And, sir, love will win.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: And love always win with Marianne Williamson. Anyway, she's the best.  WATTERS: I can't believe she dropped out. I just didn't see that coming. All right, Juan.  WILLIAMS: You're hurting over Marianne Williamson.  WATTERS: I mean, I felt like she had a real shot.  MACCALLUM: I like Marianne Williamson.  WATTERS: She seemed like she made the most sense of all the candles.  MACCALLUM: Yes, she did.  GUTFELD: She ran on love.  WILLIAMSON: I must say that's a unique point of view, Jesse. All right, so what do you think reality or fantasy, fantasy or reality? Take a look at this video.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm Bernie Sanders. I'm white. I can't help it.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: Yes, that's comedian Larry David imitating Bernie Sanders on Saturday Night Live. Now, if you thought that was good and crazy, take a look at Larry David, with this doppelganger in real life this morning.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you become president, you've got to be flying back and forth.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's not going to be easy for me. It'll be great for the country, terrible for me.  SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: They're getting you a good job for four years and you're complaining.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: I think -- I think Larry David is as good as Alec Baldwin is at imitating Donald Trump.  GUTFELD: I'm not saying much.  WILLIAMS: Maybe Larry David will have a good job for the next four years. What do you think?  MACCALLUM: So mine is that my new book, Unknown Valor: A Story of Family, Courage and Sacrifice from Pearl Harbor to Iwo Jima, is now available for pre-order on Amazon.com. I'm very excited. It's the 75th anniversary of Iwo Jim. And if one thing is accomplished from this, that it makes people look back and remember these heroes, these stories, the importance of it, to pass these stories on to your children. It all started because I have letters that were written by my uncle who was killed there at the age of 18. And these letters have been moving to me my whole life. And through this journey, I actually found two of the men who were by his side when he was killed. So it's just been an extraordinary experience for me and I hope that you will enjoy it too.  COMPAGNO: Congratulations.  (CROSSTALK)  WATTERS: Emily.  COMPAGNO: OK, all right, watch this epic fairy tale moment between these two sweethearts.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Will you live happily ever after with me?  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  COMPAGNO: Hi, hi. OK.  MACCALLUM: What just happened?  COMPAGNO: Hey guys, so that is filmmaker Lee Loechler. He pulled up this magical proposal. OK, basically what he did was he hired an animator to draw him and his girlfriend into the Disney Sleeping Beauty. She thought they were just going to see this Disney movie. In the movie, the guy tossed the ring out and he pretended to catch it and then proposer to her right there.  GUTFELD: It's not going to last, Emily.  COMPAGNO: What?  GUTFELD: It's not going to last.  COMPAGNO: Oh, for God's sake. Anyway, yes, it's way amazing. And then --  WATTERS: We nailed it.  Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC.

110,FOX,"For President Trump's critics, peace means defeat. As the post-game analysis of ""Operation Desert Burp"" continues, we realize that for President Trump's critics, peace means defeat. If you listen to the media right now, it's like we killed Lady Diana or Elvis. ""When Princess Diana died, for example, there was a huge emotional outpouring,"" Chris Matthews said on MSNBC. ""Elvis Presley, in our culture, he added. ""It turns out this general he killed was a beloved hero of the Iranian people to the point -- look at the people ... look at the crowds coming out. There's no American emotion in this case, but there's a hell of a lot of emotion on the other side."" US DEFENDS SOLEIMANI KILLING AS 'SELF-DEFENSE' AHEAD OF TENSE UN MEETING I'm almost impressed by his stupidity. Chris, you've been around. Iran can form a crowd over a sneeze. And they'll shout ""Death to America"" over anything, including when HBO canceled ""Sex and the City."" And that idea that killing bad guys makes them martyrs? We better not kill any more bad guys. By that logic, we should've stayed out of World War II, and left Usama bin Laden and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi alone. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER But, in the media's world, Trump is Hitler, and a terrorist is Martin Luther King Jr. ""What you’re describing feels like the kind of unified national outpouring that is reserved for a small handful of figures in any country, I mean, a beloved president, a civil rights leader like Martin Luther King in the United States,"" New York Times podcast host Michael Barbaro said. What an ass. But Trump once again has driven critics to defend the indefensible. Remember when they bashed Trump for being mean to MS-13? Now he's got the ""The View"" applauding white racists! The show's audience applauded news that a white supremacist tweeted his opposition to Trump. As the idiots squawk, Trump rolls on, handing out great ideas like gift baskets. We don't deserve him. Meanwhile, former Mayor Pete Buttigieg tweets that maybe we should share the blame for that downed plane -- even though Iran did the shooting. And he's running for president. So Trump once again foils his critics, not just by being right, but by letting them be so wrong. ""They made a serious mistake ... by taking this terrorist action against Commander Soleimani,"" Masoumeh Ebtekar told CNN. Does she sound familiar to you? Maybe that's because, when ABC News asked her many years ago whether she could envision killing Iran's American hostages, she responded, ""Yes. When I've seen an American gun being lifted up and killing my brothers and sisters in the streets, of course."" I'm thinking, CNN: maybe don't get an opinion on America from someone who threatened to kill American hostages.

We're all over that with the latest jobs report coast to coast coming up 12 noon on Fox News' network. We sort it out. We can help you and Meghan.  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Hi. I'm Greg Gutfeld with Katie Pavlich, Giraldo, Lawrence Jones, and Martha MacCallum. It's THE FIVE. So as the post-game analysis of operation desert burp continues, we realize that for Trump's critics, peace means defeat. I mean, if you listen to the media right now, it's like we killed Lady Di or Elvis.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When Princess Diana died, for example, there was a huge emotional outpouring. Elvis Presley in our culture, it turns out that this generally was a beloved hero of the Iranian people to the point where -- we got pictures up now, these enormous crowds coming out. There is no American emotion in this case. But there's a hell of a lot of emotion on the other side.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: I'm almost impressed by his stupidity. Chris, you've been around. Iran can form a crowd over a sneeze. And they will shout death to America over anything, including when HBO cancelled Sex and the City. And that idea that killing bad guys makes them martyrs, I guess we better not kill any bad guys then. With that logic, we should have stayed out of World War II, left Bin Laden and al-Baghdadi alone, and freed everyone from death row. But in the media's world, Trump is Hitler and a terrorist is Martin Luther King. Yes, a New York Times hack actually compared Soleimani to him.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What you are describing feels like the kind of unified national outpouring that is reserved for a small handful of figures in any country, right? I mean, a beloved president, a civil rights leader Martin Luther King.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: What an ass. But Trump, once again, has driven critics to defend the indefensible. Remember when they bashed Trump for being mean to MS13? Now, he's got The View applauding white racists, because they agree with The View.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You want some good news? This is a timing that I noticed? You remember Richard Spencer? He's basically the organizer of Unite the Right.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The lunatic.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The white nationalist group that was marching in Charlottesville and New Orleans for Trump? Not anymore. Here's his quote. He tweeted last night. I deeply regret voting for and promoting Donald Trump in 2016.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh my, gosh.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Wow.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That's interesting.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: She almost said that's good news and then she caught herself. But as the idiots squawk, Trump rolls on, handing out great ideas like gift baskets.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I spoke to secretary general yesterday and we had a great conversation. He was very -- I think I was actually excited by him. And I actually had a name. NATO, right, and then you have ME, Middle East. You'll call it NATOME. I said what a beautiful name, NATOME. I'm good at names.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: That he is. We don't deserve him. Meanwhile, Mayor Pete tweets that maybe we should share the blame for that downed plane, even though it was Iran who did the shooting. And that guy is running for president. So Trump, once again, foils his critics, not just by being right, but letting them be so wrong. Check out this CNN interview.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The American government, the American president, made a serious miscalculation. They made a serious mistake by assassinating, by taking this terrorist action against Commander Soleimani. And I'm sure that they regret what they've done.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Does that lady look familiar to you?  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You said in the press conference the other day, you said yourself that if there was an attack on this embassy, that you would destroy the hostages. Could you really do that?  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, we mean it.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Could you personally lift up a gun and put it to the head of one of these people and kill them?  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, when I see a gun being lifted up, an American machine gun being lifted up and killing my sisters and brothers in the streets, of course. Oppression and tyranny must be destroyed.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: You know, I'm thinking. Maybe don't get an opinion on America from someone who threatened to kill American hostages. But I guess in that -- got to find one person outside their own newsroom who's mad that Soleimani is dead. And that's hard, because that one person, Soleimani, is dead. So Martha, I want to go to you first about the plane. We are learning that it was probably or likely shot down by Iran. Pete Buttigieg tweeting -- I think we have the tweet that, you know, it is this tit-for-tat between military powers that led to this, essentially spreading the blame.  MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: I mean, the suggestion that there is blame from the United States or from this decision by President Trump for 176 individuals who perished in this plane crash, I think is really a remarkable, remarkable statement on behalf of someone who is running for president of the United States to not understand that this missile, from what we are learning, was sent out by Iranians. It was Russian made. It was aimed in their own effort to retaliate, which they said they wanted to do. But to not go a step further back to talk about the killing of an American contractor, to talk about the overrun or the attempted overrun of a U.S. embassy, sovereign territory in Iraq that was built by the United States. I just think it's an irresponsible statement by a presidential candidate.  GUTFELD: Yes. I don't think it helped him. Lawrence, what do you make of the War Powers Act that they're voting on?  LAWRENCE JONES, FOX NEWS HOST: Yes, I think it's a complicated matter. But I think there are two camps. Mike Lee is saying look, I went in there yesterday to question the general and the briefers about not the attack but authorization. When do you think you need to come back to Congress to declare war? He agrees with the killing of Soleimani. He believed that the president has power. As a matter of a fact, if you don't believe it, go back to the documents that Congress signed back in 2002, that gave the president the call to make this happen. And he has to notify them before or he has 48 hours to notify Congress then. So that is a wash. We don't even have to debate this. What Mike Lee is saying is that there has been moments where the intelligence community has misled. There has been moments where the military has misled. We just saw reports on Afghanistan. And we need to know all of the raw intelligence before we decide to go to war. And Congress does have the right to do this. But Democrats are using Mike Lee to say the president should've never killed Soleimani, and that's not what he's saying.  KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS HOST: And the resolution, specifically the House is working is really nonbinding. It's more of a statement, than anything, that the president is going to be beholden to. But I want to go back to the media for a minute and Democrats and Pete Buttigieg. They are making this false moral equivalency between the Iranian regime and President Donald Trump, AKA, America and what we are doing to protect Americans in the Middle East. For him to say that we had just as much responsibility for this plane shoot down, as the Iranians did, completely eliminates any kind of responsibility for that. They are hiding the black boxes. They don't want us to find out what happened. And also, it's really interesting to see the media constantly say that the president is a bigot. The president is anti-gay. The president is this. Now, they are openly defending and equating people like Soleimani to someone like Martin Luther King Jr. or Princess Di when they stone women. They hang gays off of cranes and justify it just the other day. They kill innocent protesters in the streets for daring to speak out and not show up to Soleimani's funeral. So they need to pick a side here. You can't just be against this kind of behavior when you think it's coming from President Trump, which it never is, and then turn around and defend something like the Iranian regime.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Giraldo, we've run out of time.  (CROSSTALK)  GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: You wish. This is a stupid war.  GUTFELD: It's not a war.  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: And the president's friends have had the guts to tell him. Killing Soleimani at this was a terrible idea, as I said to Martha the other day. A terrible idea, brilliantly executed. Why now, what does America -- why are we -- let me finish. Why are we picking this fight, for what?  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: We killed General Grant -- they could -- General Patton, General Petraeus. We assassinated him, for what? Why did we do that exactly? Why did we do that?  (CROSSTALK)  MACCALLUM: You're really equating him to General Patton.  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: Listen, I have got news for you. They say he killed 600 Americans. The last time I counted, there were 600,000 Iraqis who had been killed. I'm sick of this war.  GUTFELD: Me too.  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: -- for false pretences, and now we are picking a fight with the other people, the wrong --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: You are conflating two things. I agree with you about the Iraq war, and I'm hoping that this is a direction --  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: What about Afghanistan? At what point do we say enough already?  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: I agree with you on that. But this is different. This is not about war. You are in a prison of two ideas, war or no war. No, this was an executive action to take out some militia (ph) killing Americans.  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: We have already retaliated. We -- they -- this started when the militia killed an American contractor, wounded several others. What is -- that's --  (CROSSTALK)  MACCALLUM: And the attack on an American embassy.  RIVERA: Wait. You are missing something. You're -- as the media has been doing, you're missing a key thing that happened. They killed the American contractor, wounded the others. We have a massive retaliation against the same militia. In Syria and in Iraq, we killed 25 Iraqis.  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: They killed the contractor. We killed 25 Iraqis. Then they had the demonstration, the uprising, and the siege of the embassy. This was action, reaction.  (CROSSTALK)  MACCALLUM: And we took out the head of the snake of the largest terrorist organization in the world.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: No, you're right. But that's the Middle East right now. You killed somebody bad. A new one comes along. But we killed somebody bad.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Let's go. I'm with you. I'm with you. All right, coming up next, Trump heading to a rally tonight with tons of momentum while 2020 Democrats are as divided as ever. That's next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  RIVERA: The battle for 2020 heating up --  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: -- of THE FIVE. President Trump is making his way to a rally in rally in Toledo, in my adopted home state of Ohio. He's bolstered by the booming economy even as the winds of war we've been talking about blow across the Middle East. The president, about to speak to another packed crowd, reflecting his unified base as his Democratic rivals head for a big divide. This is happening. The president is speaking later tonight. You can watch it right here on Fox News. But earlier today, President Trump defended the killing of the Iranian general with the air strike.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: We caught a total monster. We took him out. And that should have happened a long time ago. We did it because they were looking to blow up our embassy.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  RIVERA: You know, that's kind of a -- the statement not quite clear there, Katie. What he is talking about is that they -- the demonstrators' kind of late siege to the embassy a couple of days before. He is not saying that there is going to be another attack on the embassy. So what do you think we win in Iran's conflict?  PAVLICH: First of all, the fear that we're talking about is not Iran. We are talking about Iraq. And people like Soleimani operating in a sovereign country and violating their sovereignty to carry out terrorist attacks on Iraqis and on American troops. President Trump, it's pretty simple, believes that the life of an American citizen, the American contractor who was killed is worth just as much if not more than someone like Soleimani, who has spent decades and decades planning attacks against Americans. He -- soon as he landed at the airport, he got in the car with another terrorist, Mohandas, who was sentenced to death.  (CROSSTALK)  PAVLICH: Let me finish my point -- for the bombing against the American embassy in Kuwait. They've been running around the Middle East causing civil wars all over the country. What the United States gained from this is this. He's taken off the battlefield. He's a very difficult person to replace. And the president is following his own doctrine, which is, take out terrorists wherever they may be. Planning attacks against American, whether it is the head of ISIS, whether it is Soleimani, and we are going to move forward without getting involved in wars --  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: I thought -- one second. I thought that the president's doctrine was not to get us involved, Martha, in these foreign entanglements.  (CROSSTALK)  MACCALLUM: Let me explain the way I see the president's doctrine. I think it is America first, based on what he established in his campaign. He said that that was his priority. He built up our defense capabilities. He wants to protect American interest abroad and national security abroad where American interests are concerned.  (CROSSTALK)  MACCALLUM: No, but you seem to be ignoring the fact, and I know there's a debate right now of where the intelligence about these imminent attacks. But are you completely negating the fact that this action was believed to have been or the White House professes that it was taken because there were imminent attacks against American interests.  RIVERA: I have been around a long time.  MACCALLUM: So you don't buy that.  RIVERA: I'm in my 50th year. You tell me what the imminence is for an attack like this.  (CROSSTALK)  JONES: Here's the deal. I don't need to.  (CROSSTALK)  JONES: He already killed 600 soldiers, 17 percent between --  (CROSSTALK)  JONES: I understand that.  (CROSSTALK)  JONES: Why did we decide to do a counterterrorism strike? Instead, you're conflating two issues. You are saying that the president has declared war after the president said, look, I don't want a regime change, which the last administration wanted regime change.  (CROSSTALK)  JONES: Hold on. Let me finish. He also said that I did this to prevent a war, not to start a war. So the president has been consistent. There is a difference between war and a counterterrorism strike.  RIVERA: Well, let me just say this, Greg Gutfeld.  GUTFELD: Yes, that is my name.  RIVERA: The -- Soleimani was on our side two months ago in fighting ISIS, in fighting Al Qaeda, in fighting Al-Nusra. He was with us to help defeat ISIS, and now --  (CROSSTALK)  MACCALLUM: I mean we were to Stalin during World War II, right? There are times when you work with people who have other interests at heart, because at that moment, it works for what you're looking for. But the other thing that you completely, I think, are overlooking in terms of the coverage of this is that there are thousands and hundreds of thousands of people in Iran who think that Soleimani has oppressed them as a people. Women who want to walk up and down the street without covering their faces, 1500 protesters who were slaughtered in the street, their bodies left to rot in the streets. They believe that he was responsible for this crackdown of their desire for freedom. Why don't they count?  RIVERA: What about the funeral of this man. Did you see those crowds, Greg?  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: I'm going to get those crowds. I'm going to get those crowds, Giraldo. Now, the fact that those crowds, that's normal for Iran, that always happens. It's part of their culture. When I talked to you about something a little bit different or bigger, you like Donald Trump. And why do you like him, because he's a game-changer. He is a once in a century kind of leader. So the thing is look at what he's done with North Korea, what he's doing with China, what he's doing with Iran. He's a walking game-changer by making decisions that other people don't. He doesn't see this as war. He saw this as a shaking the box, which it did. There may be out of this, being on the brink of war looks exactly like being on the brink of peace. And that's why I think -- why did Iran go out of its way to say we are good. We are good. It's proportionate, because they know --  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: Is this the new normal then?  (CROSSTALK)  JONES: This is not the new normal. The president is not in the middle of a war right now. It was a counterterrorism strike.  PAVLICH: Giraldo, I think we need to point that if the president was -- I think you should take what he says when he spoke at the White House to heart and not imply that he was lying about what he meant when he said I don't want war with Iran. When Iran retaliated for the killing of Soleimani, they shot missiles from Iran into Iraq. We have not shot missiles back into Iraq, which proves again that the president --  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: There was an attack that was imminent. I said, oh, man, I'm so sorry. He said that. I know it's going to happen now. People are going to say, OK, where's the proof? And he's not going to be able to provide -- and Senator Mike Lee absolutely made my point when he said this briefing --  (CROSSTALK)  JONES: That's not what he said.  MACCALLUM: That's not what he said. He said I am with the president on the decision to strike Soleimani. He was very offended at the way the briefers first came in there --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: -- owe any Congress understanding or explanation or --  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: -- sorry.  (CROSSTALK)  RIVERA: Is Nancy Pelosi's impeachment strategy about to implode? Yes, we'll tell you about it next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  MACCALLUM: A lot of news coming from Capitol Hill. You're looking live at the House floor where Congress is getting ready to vote on the war powers resolution to limit President Trump on Iran. It is expected to pass along party lines. But the big story is impeachment and what Nancy Pelosi is going to do. Cracks are beginning to show in the Speaker's strategy. The Speaker has been holding off on sending the articles over to the Senate. But now Pelosi is facing criticism from members of her own party. She is holding firm. Despite the pushback, the Speaker is holding firm. All right, let's --  (CROSSTALK)  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  NANCY PELOSI, HOUSE SPEAKER: I will send them over when I'm ready. And that will probably be soon. We want to see what they are willing to do and the manner in which they would do it. But we will not let them say, oh, this is just like Clinton. It's not. Documents -- documentation, witnesses, facts, truth, that's what they are afraid of.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  MACCALLUM: So what are you going to do? Katie, let me get your take on this. Nancy Pelosi, whether or not she's going to send these articles over, the expectation is next week. But she's holding her cards pretty close.  PAVLICH: Well, she seems to be taking this so seriously that she compared sending the articles over to a football game today during her briefing. I think that she knows that this has been a complete and total disaster for Democrats. I would give her credit in saying that she didn't want this to happen back earlier this year when she said that impeachment had to be bipartisan. She got roped into it. She's completely lost control of her caucus, both from the left. And now with people are saying we want you to push their articles over to the Senate, so the Democrats are getting very frustrated with her. Because they feel like she's undermining the institution. So I can't imagine what they thought the strategy was going to be and that Mitchell McConnell would cave to any of their demands from the lower chamber.  MACCALLUM: The narratives get pretty tangled up here. Because I remember interviewing Eric Swalwell, the Congressman from California, and he said we can't wait for a legal decision on John Bolton or we can't push for Mick Mulvaney and try to get the executive privilege removed for these witnesses, because we know that President Trump is going to do this again. And so we can't wait. Then suddenly, it was like they hit the brakes, Giraldo. And now there's all kinds of time in the world for this to fester. Which is it?  RIVERA: I think that this is a lame, pathetic exercise, political exercise. This is a foe (ph) impeachment. They have to get this over. Did they realize that they are distracting the commander-in-chief of the United States on a tacky phone call he made to a Ukrainian president? I mean, I'm willing to concede everything. It was tacky. He should not have said it. It was sloppy. He -- no crime. Get this damn thing over with. It was a mistake to begin with. And to persist in torturing this man and distracting the entire country for nothing -- you know, I like Nancy Pelosi. I hate her politics but I love her spirit. Her -- she's got spunk. But she's made the point. She showed that she's displeased. Get it to the Senate where the Constitution demands the trial be held. Get it over with. It's not going to be -- you know, he's going to be acquitted. And it's been a huge distraction, and I think it's an embarrassment for the Democrats.  MACCALLUM: Yes. I look ahead to this election year. And you have to wonder if this is something that's going to resonate with people long-term. Are people going to walk in November in the voting booth thinking about, you know, the president was impeached in the House, not Senate? How much does it really matter to the lives of everyday people, do you think?  JONES: Well, the people that I talk to on a daily basis, especially that voting for the president, feel like their vote has been threatened, that they want to take a way a duly elected president. But this was about the election. The Democratic base needed something. They promised healthcare. They didn't get that done. They promised immigration and protecting the DREAMers, right? They didn't get that done. They said they were going to repeal the President's tax bill even though they knew it was going to be vetoed. They didn't get that done. So they needed something for the base. The problem right now here was Nancy Pelosi tried to handle this like this was some type of approach appropriations bill that they -- that the Senate needed her feedback, and they don't. And instead of fighting it out in the court system, because that's how the three branches work, she decided to say Senate, you got to do it now instead of doing it in her own chamber.  MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Yes. I think one of the missing elements, Greg, that that people have not felt in this is the drama --  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Intelligence?  MACCALLUM: The drama that, you know, existed during the Nixon impeachment.  GUTFELD: Exactly.  MACCALLUM: There's no surprise. There's no like -- where is this going? Unless, of course, they get John Bolton.  GUTFELD: No. How do you regain momentum? It's like that you have a high school band and they go home for the summer and one gets a girlfriend, the other guy ends up working out his dad's factory. You can't get the lead singer anymore because he moved away. They can't get the band back together. It's over. And remember the urgency to this?  JONES: Yes.  GUTFELD: Now, it's not so urgent. This is like a drunk who fell off a pier, it's dead in the water.  JONES: Yes.  GUTFELD: Floating.  MACCALLUM: Floating, floating. Coming up --  GUTFELD: Sinking.  MACCALLUM: This is not dead in the water. Shockwaves in the U.K. after Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan break with the royal family. The fallout and what comes next for them after this.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, Megxit is taking the world by storm after Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan Markel said they are stepping back from their royal duties. They will instead move to North America part- time and become financially independent. Queen Elizabeth was reportedly blindsided by the announcement and Prince Charles and William are furious. So, Martha, I'm going to give you the floor.  MACCALLUM: Well, I don't really know what's going on here. I mean, first of all, financially independent, the Royals work something like 92 days a year, maybe 100 days a year. So if they are going to really try to be financially independent, they might have to actually work closer to what normal people work. That's number one. Secondly, he's sixth in line for the throne. If they just sort of slipped out of the public eye and did their own thing, nobody would ever really notice that they were gone. The Queen said, you know, don't make a public announcement. This is my only request to you. Don't make a big deal out of this. Let's talk about it. Let's work something out. So clearly this is sort of like me -- it's all about me moment for Meghan Markel, it appears, and for Harry. They want to make a big statement. They want it to be dramatic. They want to exit the royal family and, you know, this is stiff upper lip versus, you know, everything is about me Americanisms.  GUTFELD: Clearly you missed the whole story, Martha. Prince Andrew hit on her. Yes. You heard it here. I am the royalty expert. I knew it. By the way --  JONES: That's disgusting man.  GUTFELD: But you know what? You know what kills me? You know England is got to be ticked off because they paid for that fairytale wedding. This is like the groom's parents finding the -- no, who pays for the wedding?  PAVLICH: The bride's parents.  GUTFELD: The bride's parents. Finding the groom in the closet with the maid of honor totally negating the massively expensive --  JONES: Rumors are spreading.  GUTFELD: It's -- no, it's true. They must be angry. And by the way, they're financially sufficient. They're not moving into a studio apartment where you got to keep the stove on so the mice won't freeze.  GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS, CORRESPONDENT-AT-LARGE: I think that they endured a lot though. They -- she was --  GUTFELD: Rough life, Geraldo Marshall  RIVERA: -- racism.  PAVLICH: She's been there for a year.  GUTFELD: Who's being racist to her?  RIVERA: No, but she's really gotten all kinds of negative vibes from many in the tabloid --  GUTFELD: She just doesn't get along with their dad.  RIVERA: I just want to say --  GUTFELD: He left her to (INAUDIBLE)  RIVERA: Let me -- right, he is. This one thing, we'll cook story. Helmand Province, Afghanistan, worst place on Earth. I was right after Harry left. He put himself in harm's way.  GUTFELD: Great guy.  RIVERA: He's really a great guy. They love him. And he's -- you know, he doesn't want to happen to her what happened to his mother.  GUTFELD: It's all on her. It's all on her. She's a palace wrecker.  JONES: Yes, well, I don't like that. That's the deal though.  PAVLICH: Palace wrecker? I like it.  JONES: He decided -- they made the decision together, and she gets the blame because she's the American.  GUTFELD: Yes.  JONES: Right. And that he's in love with her --  GUTFELD: This is anti-Americanism.  JONES: It is.  MACCALLUM: I'm just hoping he doesn't wake up two years from now and go, wait a minute, I left my entire family. I left my whole life behind, and I hope -- I hope it's not a mistake.  JONES: Well, I think it's a perfect Romeo and Juliet story. I like it.  GUTFELD: I won't even -- I won't even give like pork chops for my wife.  PAVLICH: Martha, isn't -- there are --  RIVERA: I believe that. I believe you.  PAVLICH: That's beautiful.  JONES: That's because you're the Grinch that Stole Christmas.  PAVLICH: Marth, but I mean, she knew what she was getting into.  GUTFELD: Yes.  (CROSSTALK)  MACCALLUM: I mean, how hard could it possibly be? They don't have a ton of responsibility. He's sixth in line.  GUTFELD: Can you imagine how clean their toilets are? Everything is perfect.  MACCALLUM: It's just -- you know, just hang back, you know, live your own life, get out of the limelight. It's not going to -- does anyone ever go wait, hey, where's Prince Edward? How come we never hear from him. He's Charles's brother, OK. We never hear from him. They drop back. They do their own thing. They do their charitable events, but they live their own life. It's absolutely possible for these two to do the same and they obviously want to make a big stink and make a big drama.  GUTFELD: Think about all the girls that wanted to be her that had been dating Prince Harry who wanted that life who knew that life and she's throwing it away.  JONES: It doesn't matter. He wanted her and they split her time though. They're grown adults.  GUTFELD: You are a hopeless romantic, Lawrence.  JONES: Give them the money back. Give the Queen the money back. I do you think they should have notified her.  PAVLICH: You know, what's really -- you know that it's really serious though because Madame Tussauds who does the wedding --  GUTFELD: Yes.  PAVLICH: -- the royal family and celebrities. They have moved Megan Markel and Harry away from the picture.  GUTFELD: Is that what you want?  PAVLICH: They were fighting back.  RIVERA: What's amazing is how the American public adores these people generally and this couple specifically.  PAVLICH: Not anymore.  RIVERA: They are enormously -- why? I mean, I don't agree with it, Katie I think that people love her and they love the fragility of her. She's the first one to show humanity --  PAVLICH: It's the 21st century.  RIVERA: She's just like Princess Diana, Harry's mother.  JONES: Exactly.  RIVERA: And she really is.  JONES: And she's someone that could not be controlled, right?  RIVERA: Right. And I wanted to have a wife --  PAVLICH: But then, why would you move -- why would you marry a royal family?  GUTFELD: Let's adopt them. Why don't we adopt them as our own royal family?  RIVERA: Maybe she fell in love with the guy.  JONES: Yes. They can -- they can set up the relationship the way they want to set it up. And I think if he's onboard -- and we keep phrasing that it's just her. He's in agreement with this.  GUTFELD: But now he's in a fight -- he's in a fight with his brother. And I see what she's done. She is a palace breaker.  RIVERA: The Black guy and the Puerto Rican the defending the royal family.  GUTFELD: How did that happened?  PAVLICH: Moving on to more important news. We do have some breaking news. You're looking live at Capitol Hill where the House is voting on the War Powers Resolution to limit President Trump on Iran. And coming up next, the ""FASTEST SEVEN.""  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  JONES: Welcome back. Time for the ""FASTEST SEVEN."" First up, an expert is in an online etiquette out with some new rules of the road for our tech- addicted world. Here's just a couple. Never put a period at the end of a text message, reconsider replying all, moderate your use of emojis and exclamation points, and finally, never ever leave a voicemail because it's rude. Katie, I'll go straight to you.  PAVLICH: Think this person is wrong.  JONES: I don't answer the phone unless people use a voicemail if I don't know the number. So I think people should always use it.  PAVLICH: Right. So you can follow up with an e-mail and say I called you. You can have the number in your phone if there's so much spam going on. But I prefer to text in the same way that you write. Because if you try to text with shortened versions, or write you as the letter U, instead of spelling it out and using correct punctuation, and you're a writer, it translates into your writing. So I am against all of these rules that they put out. I think that they're wrong.  RIVERA: Wasn't it Mark Twain who said never use an exclamation point. It's like laughing at your own joke. And I never listened to voice messages and my phone is not set up for voicemail. Because, you know, when you get divorced, as many times as I have, your ex will call you and you can't -- you can't fast forward the voice message if it go off for 10 minutes. And so, no, I don't have voicemails.  PAVLICH: Is that 10 minutes of screaming?  JONES: Martha --  RIVERA: They're not screaming. They all love me. But that's not --  GUTFELD: They love the paychecks.  JONES: Martha, you get a lot of e-mails. Do you reply all?  MACCALLUM: I'm very -- I try to be very careful about reply all. I think you also have to be careful about reply all on text messages because you can get sort of an invented group because you're all you know, talking about one thing and then, you know, sometimes my husband will hit reply all and my kids will be on it and he'll be like, I told him he wasn't allowed to go to that, you know. And I'm like, he's on here.  PAVLICH: Just so you see this?  MACCALLUM: So you have to be careful with that. Also, voicemails are tricky because I feel like if someone says oh, I left you a voicemail, you kind of feel like, really? You know, like did you send me a text message and let me know that I should listen to my voicemail? I have one friend though who sends me these long loving hilarious voicemails, my friend Sarah, because I know if I don't say that she's going to be like, I send you voicemails all the time. But I love her voicemail, so don't stop.  JONES: What about you, Greg?  GUTFELD: The only voicemails I get are from Asia. I'm not kidding. And you know -- and people know this. It's like every -- the only people that call me on my phone are from Asia or from Marriott Rewards or my car insurance is up. I don't have car insurance.  RIVERA: Is Asia, the sex tours.  GUTFELD: Jesus, Geraldo.  JONES: Next up there are a lot of benefits for having a beard. 75 percent of men say having some facial hair helps them feel more confident. I look like a kid when I don't have facial hair so that's why I keep it. What about you, Geraldo?  PAVLICH: So long as it keeps you more confident.  RIVERA: My beard comes in white that's why I don't have it. I shave it the day -- I can't. I just chop it off.  JONES: So, does your husband have a beard?  PAVLICH: He does not. I'm not opposed to beards as long as you keep them clean.  JONES: Right.  PAVLICH: Because I read a story and a study about how men's beards are dirtier than dogs.  JONES: No. I'm not sure they do.  PAVLICH: It harbors bacteria.  JONES: No, not true for me. I washed it every single day. Martha, what about you?  MACCALLUM: All boys who go to college, they like to grow beards, but they don't understand what you understand, which is what I've been trying to explain --  RIVERA: Hygiene.  MACCALLUM: That you -- that you have to like trim it.  JONES: That's right.  MACCALLUM: You have to take care of it.  JONES: Moisturize it.  MACCALLUM: They think like the scruffy thing is cool, but you know, I am not convinced, love them as much as I do.  GUTFELD: I think beards are great for award shows, especially if your mother is still alive. But it's also sexist because women -- you know, men can cover up a weak chin with a beard, but women can't do that unless you're in the carnival. We have come a long way, but we still haven't come long enough for women to have beards at the office.  JONES: All right. Find a way to -- would this be a new office trend? The San Francisco 49ers have the NFL's first emotional support. The French Bulldog named Zoe helps the team deal with stress, depression, and anxiety.  RIVERA: Well, they're 13 and three, I don't care what they doing. They're doing it right.  PAVLICH: They're doing something right.  JONES: Yes, but I don't know. I think this is a little sensitive.  GUTFELD: I hate this. I must tell -- I got to tell you. Number one, this idea of therapy dogs is being abused and abused and abused --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: And also, we -- if NFL players need therapy dogs on the sidelines, then our country is lost. We are losing the ability to allow people to overcome challenges on their own. We're coddling our kids, we're saying, oh my God, your feelings, your feelings. Here's this puppy. That doesn't make anybody's lives better, including the puppy. The puppy doesn't want to hear about your problems.  MACCALLUM: I kind of disagree, and I'm actually anti-therapy dog and plants because I do think the definition just becomes ridiculous.  JONES: Yes, there's been abuse.  GUTFELD: It's abuse.  MACCALLUM: But I think that dogs, you know, in places like hospitals or even naturally and workplace, that's just cheers everyone up.  GUTFELD: But that's not --  MACCALLUM: But if you're on a football team, you know, and everybody is really strung up high, and they're all going out there hitting each other, maybe it's nice to just be like --  GUTFELD: That's what the paycheck is for, carry your pay stub. Look at your pay stub before you go out there and go, my God, I made $4 million a game.  RIVERA: I didn't know you wanted gentle football players.  GUTFELD: Yes.  RIVERA: When did that start?  PAVLICH: All I know is when I walk my dog down the street, everybody smiles at him and I feel --  MACCALLUM: I know. It makes people -- it just gives everyone a little bit of --  PAVLICH: So I'm fine with that.  MACCALLUM: Of all things you could do --  PAVLICH: It's better to pet a dog than to like do drugs or somebody.  GUTFELD: I would dispute that. Be specific on the types of drugs.  PAVLICH: Illegal drug.  JONES: They can keep the dog.  GUTFELD: That's too general.  JONES: ""ONE MORE THING"" is up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: Time now for ""ONE MORE THING."" Let's do this, OK?  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Animals are great. Animals are great.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Everybody on this table looks miserable when that song comes on. It makes me happy. I like solutions that solve for two problems. You know, when you want me to charge your phone, but you need to, you know, make sure that your hamsters fit, well check out this little fella here. Is this amazing? This is how you could charge your iPhone without ever needing an actual plug. You just plug it into that little thing on that little guy.  JONES: This is abuse.  GUTFELD: Is this? That's not abuse. He loves that.  JONES: He doesn't like that.  GUTFELD: You know, I did a one on one interview with him, Lawrence, and he told me personally --  (CROSSTALK)  PAVLICH: He was going to die on there.  GUTFELD: There are worst things. And that is why animals are great. All right.  JONES: That was mean.  GUTFELD: How dare you people. I'm challenged. My animals are great. Geraldo?  RIVERA: You know, this is my 50th year in the news business. Labor Day will be my actual 50th anniversary. And in recognition of that, Fox graciously, is giving me for four hours of documentaries on Fox nation that first, you know, the rock and roll years, the talk show years, the war correspondent years. But the first one is about my biggest story about the Willowbrook Institutions for the population we then described as mentally retarded. Now you don't say that. Now we call the population the developmentally disabled. And this is a trip down memory lane. I cry every time I see it or think about it.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  RIVERA: Unannounced and unexpected by the school administration, we toured building number six.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Nobody had ever really go in and filmed the actual conditions of a hellhole like this.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: People felt helpless when they had a child that is severely disabled.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The filming was so raw.  RIVERA: There was a groundswell of outrage. We put that on the air and it was like an explosion.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I am Geraldo 50 years, part of Fox News All Access only on Fox Nation.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  RIVERA: It starts on the 21st of January. I'd love you to watch it. I'd love the social work schools around the country to get it.  GUTFELD: I think that they should just do a special on your changing hair. Did you see that?  RIVERA: My has always been that cozy.  GUTFELD: Amazing. All right, Katie.  PAVLICH: That's a Twitter handle already, Geraldo's hair. OK, it is National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day. Law enforcement officers, as we all know, put their lives on the line every day for their communities. They answer the call of public service with courage and bravery. And so today, I want to give out a shout out to my good friend, Banal County Sheriff's Office Chief Deputy Matthew Thomas. He works in Arizona. He deals with a lot of bad guys and I'm just appreciative of all his work over the years. There's Sheriff Mark Lamb who he works for. That's his boss. So thank you to him for his service over his career. National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day was founded in 2015 as a way to thank officers across the country for the daily sacrifices they make for the communities that they serve and protect. So thank you to Matt Thomas.  GUTFELD: And it should be a day that is every day.  PAVLICH: Every day.  GUTFELD: Every day.  PAVLICH: So we do have a special day --  GUTFELD: I appreciate them whenever I'm pulled over.  RIVERA: Whenever he -- you're such a wiseass that no one knows when you're being serious, when you're being sincere.  GUTFELD: My wife says it to me every single day.  MACCALLUM: I read his wife say on Twitter every single day.  GUTFELD: Yes, yes. So I just keep quiet from now on. Martha, you're up.  MACCALLUM: So mine is not about law enforcement or about groundbreaking reporting like Geraldo did with Willowbrook. Mine is about this very strange dear story. Just watch this. So this is Hugo, Minnesota. He went out to get the mail and then this deer just sort of wanted him to keep petting him, and then he wanted to come home with him, and then he hung out with the family in the driveway for a while. So I'm just trying to you know -- dear to me -- this scares me for the deer. It's like when squirrels don't run away and get too close to them. I think he maybe was domesticated and maybe somebody had him and then they let him go. But anyway, dear should want to run when they see you, don't you think?  GUTFELD: Yes.  PAVLICH: Don't feed the animals, everybody. This is what happens.  MACCALLUM: I know this is cute and everything, but I just think he's going to be defenseless and he's going to end up you know --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Did you hear what Lawrence said, maybe he's an orphan and he wants to like a (INAUDIBLE)  MACCALLUM: Well, they're taking -- he's eating French fries out of their front car -- our their car.  GUTFELD: Well, anyway --  MACCALLUM: That's it. That's it. That's all there is to it.  GUTFELD: That was a fun story.  JONES: How much do you love Taco Bell? You all got to this. Probably not as much as this guy who was craving the Bell so badly that he broke into one of George's Taco Bells on Christmas morning. Look at this guy. No cook, no problem. The burrito bandit used the restaurant's deep fryer and made himself an off-menu special. Look at this guy.  GUTFELD: He's hilarious.  JONES: He's going to get what he want. Now, what happens after you eat a whole bunch of Taco Bell?  GUTFELD: I'm afraid.  PAVLICH: I don't want to know.  GUTFELD: I know what happens to.  JONES: You thought that you need to take a nap. So he's taking a nap. He takes a nap for a couple of hours after his meal. He stays there for a little bit. And then when he leaves, he takes the computer, a tablet. But he cleaned up though guys.  PAVLICH: Wait, did they arrest him?  JONES: He cleaned up. They still haven't found him. He's still at large.  PAVLICH: Oh my gosh.  GUTFELD: I have a feeling. Probably -- if he knew how to work the instruments, he must have -- he must have --  JONES: I know. He knew everything was --  PAVLICH: You think he works there?  GUTFELD: Yes. I think he works there.  JONES: Or maybe worked at a Taco Bell.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: He certainly as a shell of a man. Maybe he'll be grounded. I'm running out of things to say. OK, that's probably a good thing. Set your DVRs. Never miss an episode of THE FIVE. ""SPECIAL REPORT"" is up next. Hello, Brett.  BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Hello, Greg.

112,FOX,"Trump says he will impose more sanctions on Iran; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" January 8, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Hello, everyone. I am Juan Williams along with Katie Pavlich. Brian Kilmeade is here. Shannon Bream is here, and of course, we've got Greg Gutfeld. It is 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is THE FIVE. A big moment in a showdown with Iran, President Trump addressing the nation today after Iran launched more than two dozen missiles at U.S. troops in Iraq. It was retaliation for the killing of their top military commander, Iran's supreme leaders calling the strikes a, quote, ""slap in the face to America."" Here is the president responding earlier.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: The American people should be extremely grateful and happy. No Americans were harmed in last night's attack by the Iranian regime. Our great American forces are prepared for anything. Iran appears to be standing down. We have sent a powerful message to terrorists. If you value your own life, you will not threaten the lives of our people.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: The president also pushing back against criticism of his decision to take out the Iranian general with an air strike.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: At my direction, the United States military eliminated the world's top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani. In recent days, he was planning new attacks on American targets. But we stopped him. Soleimani's hands were drenched in both American and Iranian blood. He should have been terminated long ago.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: And we're some new details about last night's missile strike, including how U.S. military officials had advanced warning before those missiles hit, and the Pentagon concluding Tehran made a political decision by choosing targets so that they would not kill Americans. Shannon up from Washington, I think everyone's, you know, left and right pretty happy. It seems like things have de-escalated at the moment. But I saw a Reuters' poll today that still said 54 percent of Americans don't approve of the way president Trump has been handling Iran.  SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Yeah. I will be interested to see if there is a change in the numbers after his speech today, his remarks today.  Because last night what we were hearing endlessly is this is World War III.  The president's done everything wrong. He's failed on foreign policy. And this morning when the president came out and gave these remarks and said we want peace. We are de-escalating. This is it. The headlines were still awful about the president. I think there are certain quarters out there that are never going to approve of anything that he does, even though he said we want to have talks. We want to have peace. This is offering. Let's de-escalate and be done with this. He didn't come out as many of his critics predicted, saying we are going to bomb Iran off the face of the Earth. So even when they give him, I think, what's unexpected than what they said they wanted, they don't still seem happy.  WILLIAMS: Brian, what's your take? One thing that the critics, as, you know, Shannon was talking about. Critics say, well, we appreciate the fact that the president seems, right now, to be acting in a restrained manner that doesn't look like things are going in the wrong direction in the case of war. But that he didn't say anything about this so-called imminent attack that he said existed and was the reason for, you know, sending a missile to kill Soleimani.  BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: I think it's important to take a step back, Juan, and say how did we get here? Basically, the thing that was the breaking point for the president was when he saw the embassy raided. When he got past the perimeter, when they were in rest room (ph), they burned the reception area and they spray painted on the outside among many things this is Soleimani's land. And we know he was calling the shots. I think anybody here argues here or there what is power is. The thing about him he is not a crazy man. He is a tactical terrorist. He knows how to link it together. He knows how to plot and plan. He's had 40 years of experience. But I would say this. To take him out, I think the president and his staff and the Secretary of Defense had the wrong reason. It shouldn't be an imminent attack. It should Benghazi accumulation of attacks, including the one that happened four days ago, and we wouldn't be in this controversy. It allowed his critics to say excuse me, Mr. Pompeo, what exactly did you see? And it's almost off track in my mind.  WILLIAMS: All right. So Katie, when you think about what the president did today. I think everybody, as I say, is breathing a sigh of relief. It doesn't look like. But do you think that this means that we can be assured there won't be future attacks by the Iranians?  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Or their terrorist satellites.  KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Well, look. The president gave the Iranians a choice today. He said we are opening the door to a new deal and new negotiation. We want the Iranian people to have an economy that is beneficial to them. We want the leadership to make the right decisions to be a normal country, to stop using proxy forces to destabilize the region and to carry out terrorist attacks against American troops, allied troops, and also innocent people who live in places like Lebanon and Yemen and Syria. But he was resolved today. And he made it very clear that this is not over with Iran, and that he is taking a comprehensive approach to the issue.  His first line was not about Soleimani or even the attack last night from Iran. It was about the nuclear program. So it's very clear that he is taking this approach as a long-term issue. And he's not done with this.  And of course, the Iranians will continue their proxy attacks until they can come to terms with the idea that they want to move forward. And the sanctions that the president put on them today in addition will hopefully put them in that direction.  WILLIAMS: So I was waiting on you to call me last night. You know that because I think, man, you know, I don't know what's going on. Are we going to war or are we are not going to war. I want to be with Greg to see what's Greg's reaction --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: You were here.  GUTFELD: Yes.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: I didn't know.  (CROSSTALK)  KILMEADE: -- Shannon Bream, she was on at midnight.  GUTFELD: Here's the deal. I now realize why Hollywood hates Trump so much. His era is going to produce terrible war movies, because this is the fourth year of his administration, and this is Trump's war and it lasted a day. It is desert burp. You know, he's killing his genre. You can't get a Saving Private Ryan. You can't get a Platoon out of Trump. You can't get a Blackhawk Down. You might get even one episode of MASH out of it, because he is not about war. He's about shaking the box and creating new beginnings. I want to think -- think about the variables of the last couple of days. We know Iran can hit stuff, but they didn't. They put the miss in missiles on purpose. We got advanced warning, right? We had an ayatollah that told the proxies to layoff. And then he said that last night was proportionate to America killing a general. What is he telling you? They are not so upset about what happened that in fact that maybe the general was an impediment to the things that they wanted to do too. He killed a lot Iranian protestors. There's no love there for that guy --  (CROSSTALK)  KILMEADE: -- cold blood.  GUTFELD: And the ayatollah, I'm telling you. I don't believe he was super close with this guy. So I'm thinking that this was the way to shape the Iranian box and to start over. And last night was -- may I use a sports analogy.  KILMEADE: Just one.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: This is like a team -- it's when you allow a team to score a touchdown in the fourth quarter against your scrubs because they are behind 77 to nothing. This was operation saving face for Iran. To let them have their token score so everybody can walk away. I think what Trump has done is he's blown up the myths and the lies. He is actually really good at this stuff. He is not impulsive. This is something that was thought through. And it was decisive and unpredictable.  WILLIAMS: You had me until the end. You had me until the end.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Because -- wait a minute. Like, imagine if the Iranian missile had, you know, landed a few feet in the wrong direction.  GUTFELD: Why do you think we knew about that?  WILLIAMS: I think they wanted us to know.  GUTFELD: Yes. That's my point.  BREAM: You have to remember there is a lot of stuff that happens behind- the-scenes that not everybody hears about. I talked to General Keen about this. He talked to a couple of top military officials Monday, and they said the president has sent a message through intermediaries, probably the Swiss. This often happens that way to say to the leaders in Iran. We don't want a war and we're not going to advocate for regime change.  Those channels are open and those conversations happen. So it's not always what it appears on the surface.  KILMEADE: They heard said heard chatter about the attack. We know the attack takes four to five minutes so -- for it to land from the time it was launched until it landed. That was the most ridiculous light show I ever saw last night. I don't know why I pretended to know what it was. All I say was three lights in the sky that travelled forever. And in the end, thankfully, they didn't hit anything.  GUTFELD: Well, they might have hit a plane.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: I am glad it wasn't off target. Next on THE FIVE 2020, Democrats slamming the president over the Iran attack, and Trump's got a plan to counter them. Stay with us. You're going to hear it right here on THE FIVE.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  KILMEADE: Brand new information just coming in. America's top general saying this. The Iranian air strike intended to cause structural damage destroyed vehicles and equipment and to kill personnel. We will keep an eye on that story. And we do not know if anything structurally was bombed out in the base. Meanwhile, Democrats are blasting the president after Iran targeted U.S. forces in Iraq. Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  ELIZABETH WARREN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It is a reminder where Donald Trump has taken us, and that is right to the edge of war.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It would make the Iraq war look like a picnic.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's imperative that the commander-in-chief think through all the implications of his actions. But unfortunately, as we all know, that's just not in his nature.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We should not be responding disproportionately in a way that elevates the conflict and intention in the region.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's created more problems than solved.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Cowboy diplomacy did not work in Iraq. Cowboy diplomacy will not work in Iran.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  KILMEADE: OK. President Trump is hitting back by reportedly planning to paint the 2020 candidates as Iranian sympathizers. And Speaker Nancy Pelosi is blaming Trump for what happened, saying this, that he is the one responsible for provoking the Iranians. Congresswoman Liz Cheney is calling out Pelosi for thos comments, I believe, on Fox and Friends.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: In the wake of missiles raining down on American service members in Iraq, Speaker Pelosi is saying that it was needless provocation our part. She's blaming the United States of America. She's suggesting a moral equivalence between the United States and Iran. I think she is clearly an embarrassment.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  KILMEADE: I have never seen anything like it, a major military strike or an event or a target. And you have so many people playing partisan politics. In fact, when Nancy Pelosi was told that Vice President Michael Pence was on the phone and she was out. He said tell him I will call him back. You know what he had to say? We had -- we were being attacked. Go ahead, Ms. Pavlich.  (CROSSTALK)  PAVLICH: And then two minutes later, she gets a note saying we're -- incoming from Iran into Iraq against where are troops are being stationed and housed. So -- and then after that, she gets on Twitter and tweets out that she is closely monitoring the situation, and then a reporter sees her at an open house or an opening to a fancy new restaurant and Navy arts (pharmacy).  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: -- mini burgers.  PAVLICH: Yeah, it's really important. But she can't have it both ways.  And this is what Democrats are trying to do. They can't scream about not being briefed beforehand about what's going on and then ignore when crucial information comes in and then go to parties while they're claiming to be monitoring the situation. President Trump did not declare war on Iran. He decided, as the commander- in-chief, to carry out his duty, to protect Americans, so he took out the top leading Iranian terrorist who was in Iraq meeting with other terrorists like Rogmati Mohandas (ph) to plan more attacks. And they are sitting across from the U.S. embassy in Baghdad doing this. And so if Democrats want to argue that he is the one to -- who was provoked, it goes in line with their blame America first policies, matter what it is, but especially when it comes to foreign policy. And the question for people like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders who has a long record of praising people like Che Guevara and Maduro and dictators who've killed a lot people. The question what is your alternative. If you want to be the commander-in- chief, it is your duty to protect Americans from threats. Soleimani was a threat. He's a threat in the future. He was a threat in the past. And he carried out the murders of hundreds of Americans and destabilized the entire region.  (CROSSTALK)  KILMEADE: Juan, you agree?  WILLIAMS: No.  PAVLICH: Why not?  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Of course. Look, there is a difference between what Republicans are trying to portray, which is, oh, Democrats were guilty of appeasement, appeasement.  PAVLICH: They were.  WILLIAMS: There is something called diplomacy, called containment, which is what the Obama administration tried to do. Now, you have a situation where lots of people today are saying, oh -- I think including one Donald Trump, saying, oh, you know what those missiles are being fired? They were paid for by the money that President Obama gave back to the Iranians. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. First it was Iranian money that we were withholding since they held our hostages many years ago. And we -- as part of their release, the release of people like that Washington Post journalist. We made a deal. OK, but that's not giving our money to Iran.  (CROSSTALK)  PAVLICH: John Kerry at the time -- John Kerry and the White House admitted when they were asked directly. Do you think that this money will go towards terrorism? It came directly to Soleimani. It's exactly what happened.  WILLIAMS: It goes to the Iranian people, Katie, and remember --  PAVLICH: No.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: We are in a situation -- we are in a situation we were trying to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. And until today, Iran, according to all the international inspectors, all the international countries, was not doing it.  KILMEADE: But I'll tell you. You cannot have a deal and the problem fundamentally is, Greg, you can't have a deal with Iran and also not have terror included in that deal, because that's what they do best.  GUTFELD: Also, they were not letting inspectors in seeing some places. So that was a problem, too. Look, you got a strike a delicate balance here.  You can't blame the Dems because they're out of power, which means they have to do -- say and do everything designed to get them back into power, which means anything Trump does especially when it's good has to be portrayed as bad. However, there -- it is a delicate balance. They have crossed the line here. They have to just say, yeah, we can't stand Trump, but this turned out to be pretty damn good. And by the way, we have to remember that Iran and Trump agree on one real big thing. They don't want to be there. So I think at a certain point this might open up a whole new vista where Iran and Trump can talk about the exit strategy.  KILMEADE: Iran wants to be Iraq.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: I am talking about America. I'm talking about -- and you know what, Americans shouldn't -- we should be getting our butts out of the Middle East. And I think right now Trump is removing psychological barriers in a number of different areas. It started with North Korea.  We're looking at China. We're looking at Iran. I mean, this is -- it's a combination of Trump's unpredictability and persuasiveness that is what's making this hard for Democrats to figure out.  It's driving them nuts.  BREAM: It puts them in a tough place, the Democrats, because they're having to make a opposition -- take a position, of course, as Greg says.  It only makes sense they're going to opposition to the president on most things. You would hope it is not an issue of this kind of -- it shouldn't be partisan because our men and women who are uniform, all of us have people that we love and that we know who are there. They don't want this to be partisan either. But you can just see some of the commercials now, if say Elizabeth Warren, Senator Elizabeth Warren ended up being the nominee, Trump is going to run ads of her being pushed and pushed again by Meghan McCain refusing to call Soleimani a terrorist.  KILMEADE: The screaming headline to the Washington Post would've been when intelligence emerged that the president had word that Soleimani had lead and the fact that airport --  (CROSSTALK)  KILMEADE: -- and he did actually implement a terror activity, they would say Trump did not have the guts to do it when he said he did.  (CROSSTALK)  KILMEADE: President Bush, President Obama did not do it. This meme of --  (CROSSTALK)  KILMEADE: Somebody got it right.  WILLIAMS: No, because --  (CROSSTALK)  KILMEADE: I don't miss him --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Brian, Brian, didn't President Obama launch more drone attacks?  (CROSSTALK)  KILMEADE: I am all for it. I am all for it.  (CROSSTALK)  KILMEADE: -- this guy is bigger than Bin Laden.  WILLIAMS: And chaos ensues.  GUTFELD: Where is the chaos?  PAVLICH: Right here on this set.  (CROSSTALK)  KILMEADE: We'll be the control room if I don't tease now. Coming up straight ahead, Barack Obama and Joe Biden's foreign policy under fire after Iran shoots missiles at U.S. forces in Iraq. Hear from President Trump, next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  BREAM: The Obama administration's foreign policy with Iran is getting heavy criticism after last night's missiles attacks on U.S. forces.  Republicans say the previous administration gets a lot of the blame for what happened.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The missiles that we saw fired on U.S. servicemen and women tonight were paid for by the billions that the Obama administration flooded the ayatollah with.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Obama was conned by the Iranians.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The violence that Iran has undertaken has been animated by the Iran deal. It has been funded by the Iran deal.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Maybe they should pay more attention to what happened when the billions dollars from the last administration was sent to them and where the money was spent.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  BREAM: And President Trump going after his predecessor as well.  TRUMP: Iran's hostilities substantially increased after the foolish Iran nuclear deal was signed in 2013. They were given $150 billion, not to mention $1.8 billion in cash. Instead of saying thank you to the United States, they chanted death to America. The missiles fired last night at us and our allies were paid for with the funds made available by the last administration.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  BREAM: All right. So we've heard from a lot of the folks who were involved with putting that Iran nuclear deal together. Folks from the Obama administration, they're out there defending it, and saying -- for example, Brian, Ben Rhodes, who was with the Obama administration saying since this administration pulled out, Iran has resumed all of its nuclear programs, increased its provocations, and the U.S. is now isolated.  KILMEADE: And economically, they were on their knees to the fact that the protesters who were in the streets in rural areas. They couldn't possibly be organized by any special outside forces because they're -- because their lives are so terrible and the regime is so awful, and they have raising old (ph) generation of Iranians that aren't even as religious as the government in which they are now oppressed by. But I'll add another thing to this. There is no scenario -- would it be OK for Iran to have the funding that would allow them to have the economic funding to support Hezbollah, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and all their terrorists causes. That was the fundamental issue. And I call on the president. The president did something extremely important. He called on NATO to follow Iran out of this deal, and then you're going to see some changes.  BREAM: Well, Greg, we heard from Juan about this. I know you're busily writing.  GUTFELD: Yes.  (CROSSTALK)  BREAM: You're like a stenographer.  GUTFELD: Yes, I am.  BREAM: Anyway, we heard from Juan already who thinks it's not a good connection to make between the money we sent and these missiles.  GUTFELD: Well, it's too -- it's a natural connection. Obama gave Iran a stack of dead presidents. Trump gave them one dead general. That's a pretty good comparison. And it looks like that's exactly what the United States and Iran kind of wanted. Look, you have to compare. I don't compare Trump to Obama. I compare Trump to Ben Rhodes. I don't think Ben Rhodes could get a good rate on a rental car. I don't think -- when he negotiates for his cable bill, you probably negotiate to a higher bill. Because that's how -- he's a wormy, slippery wonk, and you've got Trump who spent most of his time trudging through conduction sites, wearing a hard hat, talking to the guys --  (CROSSTALK)  BREAM: Made of gold.  GUTFELD: Made of gold, yes, exactly. He has -- again, the two tools, unpredictability and persuasion. You put those two together. They're incredibly effective. And he knows how to deal with businesses and he knows how to make deals. And people make fun ever him. He is impulsive.  He doesn't know what he's doing. When are you going to give it up?  BREAM: Not soon. OK Juan, the president's point was -- we gave them billion dollars. And instead of saying thank you, United States, they've chanted death to America.  WILLIAMS: Oh, gee. And they also signed a deal that gave Israel, our ally in the Middle East, further protection against a nuclear attack. Was that our goal? I think that was our number one goal. And now, they are out of the deal. And the president is having to ask Germany, France, England, everybody else. Oh, please, don't support Iran in this deal anymore. I don't know. It seems to me that the nukes are back in play. The sanctions that you're talking about, Brian, if the sanctions were so effective, then why is the general out there plotting attacks? It's seems to that --  KILMEADE: I don't know what one has to do with the other.  WILLIAMS: Well, clearly, the idea was that the sanctions would punish Iraq -- Iran.  (CROSSTALK)  BREAM: And to that point though, Katie, I mean, we saw protests all over the country. I mean scores of cities, people -- estimates are 1500 people were killed. I mean, the Iranian people are separate. I don't know that this funding every trickled down to them.  KILMEADE: It never did.  PAVLICH: It never did, clearly, which is why they're having all these economic problems and they are protesting against the regime. But the issue of Ben Rhodes saying and not actually like usual that the United States is now isolated in the region is absurd. The people closest to the issue the Israelis, the Saudis, the UAE, the Egyptians, they are all on our side. When Barack Obama was in charge, they push all of our real allies away, cozy up to Iran, and to the Europeans, quite frankly, who have really done nothing to stop the proliferation of Iranian terrorism all around the world.  And the Israelis didn't like the Iran deal since the beginning, because they knew that there was a sunset clause that would eventually lead to the Iranians getting a nuclear weapon, which they proved when they went into Iran and took out all of those files that they found and took out into Israel, which proved that the Iranians had every intention of restarting their nuclear program once that sunshine clause was triggered. So that's a lie for him to say that. The other thing is the Obama administration approached Iran as only with the nuclear issue. They completely when they're negotiating this left the terrorism ballistic missile issue out of the picture. The Trump administration is doing the opposite. They're doing a whole comprehensive approach and saying, we don't separate the two. We're doing everything.  BREAM: All right, we're going to leave it there. But coming up, you're going to find out what's in Greg's notes because he's going to take on the media coverage of Iran's missile attack. Stay tuned to THE FIVE.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: So as usual, the media brings nothing to the table except the chip on their shoulder and a hunger for chaos. And last night, they saw the fog of war as the perfect time for solemn pronouncements courtesy of Iran television.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  ALI AROUZI, TEHRAN BUREAU CHIEF, NBC NEWS: I'm not sure about it. Iran state media is claiming that 30 U.S. soldiers have been killed in this attack and out this is not confirmed. This is just coming from Iranian media. But we have just stepped over the precipice.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: The precipice. Now, how did that guy get that info so fast? You can't even get a box for that quickly. Maybe that should have tipped him off. Meanwhile, NBC invited its viewers to watch the live coverage of Soleimani's burial. I hear Michael Moore lowered his belly at half-mast.  And over at Morning Joe, all hair and no brains ties it all back to Russia.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JOE SCARBOROUGH, HOST, MSNBC: It would be hard to believe that Donald Trump would launch attacks into Iran without speaking first of Vladimir Putin. This would obviously lie at the heart of Vladimir Putin's interests since Iran has long been seen by Putin as a client state of Russia.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: My God. Thanks, Beavis. But what about butthead? I bet he thinks this President is impulsive.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JIM ACOSTA, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, CNN: This is a president who is impulsive and doesn't think through the implications of his actions.  This could have been a massive catastrophe of proportions that we just can't fully appreciate. And so this was -- this was a dangerous night at the casino for President Trump.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Nothing changes. He's like a stopped clock with Brylcreem. So imagine going to the movies and facing the wrong way in your seat. That's the media, always missing the big picture, preferring a story that matches the voices in their heads, saying, hey guys, seems a little early to call this World War Three. That only pisses off the Jeff Zucker's of the world who count on chaos to make bank. Just ask the Covington kid. And yet even after that lesson, they still can't stop.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're only here at this moment, this very dangerous moment because of Donald Trump's impulses.  RACHEL MADDOW, HOST, MSNBC: These kinds of world-changing and historic calamities --  STEVE SCHMIDT, ANALYST, MSNBC: We are at the early stages of a hot war.  It is a monumental moment.  ACOSTA: This is exactly what many foreign policy and national security analyst feared here in Washington.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This could have a very significant effect. We may be on a road to a very different Middle East come sunrise.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is a really very grave and serious moment.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: Yep. Look, I am not saying this isn't serious. But all of a sweaty hysterics come up as wishful thinking, can you just dial it back a little, especially when you're always wrong. But maybe that reporter was right. We are on the precipice of peace, not war. It's certainly not over. It's Wednesday, which is better than Tuesday. Last night was just another chance to scare the crap out of us. For the media and the Trump era, the Apocalypse is every day that ends in Y.  Shannon, why -- I noticed that the media rather than analyzing their mistakes, immediately repeats it by going what happens next. They don't say like, wow, we really screwed up. They go, well, what's going to happen tomorrow? I'm noticing that now it's like, OK, we thought there was World War Three, no war, but it could happen tomorrow.  BREAM: Well, it could.  GUTFELD: Yes.  BREAM: I mean, these guys say that it's not over. The Ayatollah says it's not over. But you're right. I think that even -- as I said earlier, when they get what they want from their president or what they think they want, which they said there should not be a response, we want to see a measure, not do anything crazy, he comes out and gives this speech which was very calm, almost monotone saying we want peace, we want to help the people of our of Iraq, all kinds of things.  The Washington Post just pops up in my e-mail, an op-ed piece it says, they call that a deranged speech. That's the quote. They said, there was no eloquence, it was filled with lies, garbled a terrible speech that didn't - - that didn't convince anyone. He's never going to win over some of these people. It's not going to happen.  GUTFELD: You know, Juan, I was watching CNN at the gym because that's what's on. You know, I watched -- I saw Barbara Starr, I saw Gloria Borger, I saw Christiane Amanpour. It seems --  WILLIAMS: On the treadmill or on the television?  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: It seems to me, it's the same old names, and the same old faces, and the same old same old stuff. Is there going to be some quality control?  WILLIAMS: You mean, all the way back to weapons of mass destruction.  GUTFELD: Yes.  WILLIAMS: I mean, the media -- the media just went along as oh yes, we go along with the administration. Yes, yes, sure. There must be weapons in there.  GUTFELD: But they're wrong now.  WILLIAMS: The press' job is to be skeptical and to challenge --  GUTFELD: Especially the Republicans.  WILLIAMS: Where are the facts? Where are the facts that justify you going out and setting off what could have been a tragic situation? We're happy today that things have gone down quietly, but, you know, we got to understand one errant missile could have been a tragedy. The other thing is I really disagree with the business about the reporter.  I think reporters who are in a country like Iran where there's no First Amendment, no protections, you know, I think of reporters --  GUTFELD: You shouldn't be reporting Iran's state T.V.  WILLIAMS: Well, but if they -- if you say this is what the government says, we can't confirm it. If you're in North Korea, Greg --  GUTFELD: Saying 30 Americans are dead.  WILLIAMS: You don't know.  GUTFELD: That's totally irresponsible.  WILLIAMS: No, it's not. If that's what he as -- he attributed directly --  GUTFELD: He turned on Iranian state T.V.  WILLIAMS: He attributed directly to the Iranian government.  GUTFELD: He should not cover it.  WILLIAMS: Well, I'm just saying that's the reporter's job.  GUTFELD: As a guy who's been in the field for 40 years, Juan.  WILLIAMS: I appreciate that. I know. I know. But imagine if you were in North Korea, sometimes, you know, even a Fox reporter has to say some things because the North Koreans are monitoring this.  KILMEADE: How about this? The Iranians are saying 30 are dead. The Americans are saying none.  WILLIAMS: Right.  KILMEADE: The American public can make a decision saying the initial says 30 dead. I don't know. One of the reporter actually say, I don't know if that's true or not.  WILLIAMS: What do you mean?  KILMEADE: OK, maybe you should wait.  WILLIAMS: Well, now we know.  KILMEADE: Well, now we know, but then we didn't.  WILLIAMS: Right.  KILMEADE: Christopher Hayes said clearly the war in Iran is madness and strategically and morally a disaster in the making, and don't believe anyone that tells us otherwise. Oh, thanks. I appreciate the analysis.  Lawrence O'Donnell, Trump wag the dog and now the dog is wagging Trump.  Really? By hitting the middle of an empty base?  PAVLICH: You know, it's like OK, so he prevents Benghazi happening at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. The whole press says it could have been in Benghazi, it was Benghazi, and then they find out more information and it's actually not that. And then he does get credit for preventing an attack.  And then they continue on and criticize him when he takes decisive action to protect Americans. You can't win on that. But Juan, they teach you in journalism school not to repeat a report government propaganda, and they teach you all about how most of the media in these countries is run by the government and you shouldn't --  WILLIAMS: Yes.  PAVLICH: You shouldn't glorify or publicize anything they say as fact.  And for them to repeatedly say, I am confirmed, I don't know, but then stated as something that should be taken seriously really undermines our credibility --  GUTFELD: It's like a second shooter in mass shooting.  PAVLICH: Yes. It's just --  GUTFELD: You know, there's another shooter out there and there never is.  There's only one. It's like, they can't wait.  WILLIAMS: But I think the credibility -- the credibility -- the person whose credibility is undermined here is Iran's, not ours because it's (INAUDIBLE). But you got to report that. When you're in a breaking news situation, you're just trying to, you know, control what you get, and he attributed it properly. It was the government.  PAVLICH: Well, this gives us a quick chance to thank our reporters Trey Yingst, Jennifer Griffin, Lucas Tomlinson --  WILLIAMS: Absolutely.  GUTFELD: Greg Gutfeld.  BREAM: Benjamin Hall.  PAVLICH: They're all over our breaking news last night. They did a great job.  KILMEADE: And how do you know when this story begins to turn to the President's direction? When they talk about impeachment. They'll pivot as soon as they realize there's no there there.  GUTFELD: I was on location throughout this whole thing at Equinox gym.  KILMEADE: I know.  PAVLICH: On the ground.  GUTFELD: I was on the ground.  WILLIAMS: You are -- you look marvelous.  GUTFELD: All right, coming up. CNN is settling a major lawsuit with Covington student Nick Sandmann after he was smeared by the media. The details are next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PAVLICH: It looks like Covington high school student Nick Sandman has scored a legal win after being smeared by the media. CNN has settled a $250 million defamation suits Sandmann filed over a confrontation with the Native American man that made the teenager look like the aggressor. Here, look back at just some of the media coverage.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Some students harassing an older Native American man, a Vietnam vet in the midst of a special ceremony.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It does look like that young man to me is taunting the Native American Vietnam vet.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This face to face confrontation igniting charges of racism.  CHRIS CUOMO, ANCHOR, CNN: The kid, Nick Sandmann, he doesn't seem to be afraid, but he did make a choice and that was to make it into a standoff.  That was not a good choice.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PAVLICH: Greg, blood boiling.  GUTFELD: Cuomo does not look good there. As good looking as he is, though. He keeps going to the gym. I want to know how much money this was settled for. And we'll never know. It drives me crazy. But this is really good news for everybody on the planet because it's a turning point. Before, there really wasn't any consequences to social media mobbery and the cancer culture where somebody could dig up something from Brian or Juan's past and just destroy you, just destroy you. Not you, Shannon, because you're --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: But now, if you know that somebody can sue you, that changes your behavior. And if you don't have deep pockets, I mean, your company is going to worried. So I think this is -- could put an end to the swarm.  That thing that happens when somebody finds out you said some stupid when you were 16. So I hope they -- I hope they got something good. I hope the kid can -- has his education paid for.  PAVLICH: So Juan, isn't this a learning moment for reporters everywhere that you should be interested in the facts, not the narrative first?  WILLIAMS: I hope you're always interested in the facts first. But you know, I just don't know what this means. I think that a lot of people who are -- who don't like CNN are quick to rush and say, oh, this has mean CNN, you know, admitted that they did wrong. I think, you know, I know lawyers.  The lawyers are like, we have to go through discovery, then that means e- mails and discussions are going to be revealed. We may not want that out.  I don't know if the kid got a dollar, but I certainly can tell you as I sit here, I don't think he got 200 -- was it $250 million?  KILMEADE: Yes. $250 million.  GUTFELD: If he got 10 percent, he'd be happy.  WILLIAMS: 10 percent, yes, you're right. Exactly.  GUTFELD: $25 million.  KILMEADE: There's still suing NBC, and the Washington Post, and 13 more defendants are going to be named, ABC, CBS, The Guardian, Huffington Post, NPR, and Slate, and the Hill are all coming up and they're going to get hit with lawsuits.  WILLIAMS: I don't know.  BREAM: Well, and Juan, like you said, when you go into discovery, I mean, I used to have clients who -- you would talk to them and say, listen, this is how much it's going to cost you to go to trial. This is what they want in settlement. What do you want to do? And some people would say, yes, we don't want all that stuff out there. We'll pay. I had other clients who would say, we will not pay a dime because what we're worried about is if we pay this person, the next one's going to want it, and the next one, and the next one. So CNN had to make a lot of calculations here that, you know, just be on the legal issues.  PAVLICH: Yes. But Brian, aren't there questions about you know, how the media handled this. I mean, they really -- they went after a teenager.  They did it because he was wearing a mega hat. They said all these horrible things about him. His reputation was --  KILMEADE: At a pro-life rally.  PAVLICH: Yes, at a pro-life rally. He was -- his reputation was destroyed and put on the -- put on the internet forever.  KILMEADE: A white kid taking on an American Indian.  PAVLICH: Yes. And then they didn't back up and gave the same amount of coverage to the entire context of the story as they did the immediate narrative that they all put out.  KILMEADE: Absolutely. And that's why they have to get aggressive. I know what you're saying, Shannon. A lot of people, big companies don't want to go through it, they write the check. But in this case, this kid asked for an apology. If they just said listen, I blew it, this thing would been over. So if you're not worried about your reputation, which looks bad now because you admitted your guilt and wrote a check, we don't know how big as much as Greg needs to know and I'm very curious to know, this kid should get a money, a lot of money. He's going to apply to colleges now. How many college is going to go, I don't need this. I don't need this. I got to move on.  PAVLICH: Right. Exactly.  KILMEADE: I got to hire that kid. I don't -- I don't need that --  GUTFELD: He should not go to college. He should take the money and start a business.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: OK, wait a minute. This is -- now we're gone away. This is your theory.  GUTFELD: I want to manage Nick's money. You call me, Nick. I'll take care of everything for you.  KILMEADE: What's your experience? You have no experience.  PAVLICH: OK. Greg also wants 10 percent. ""ONE MORE THING"" is up next.  WILLIAMS: You know what, he told me the other day, he's doing --  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WILLIAMS: It's time now for one more thing. Let's get the party started by saying Happy Birthday, Elvis Presley. The man known as the King of Rock and Roll would have been 85 today. So for millennials out there, let me give you a taste of why we boomers still remember a man who created a bridge between the blues and rock and roll before he died in 1977. Look at this. Yep, that's Jailhouse Rock. And of course, Elvis if you notice his hips was a sexy stage presence. Parents were concerned about the way he moved those hips. And of course, I just think you should also know Elvis could sing a love song.  GUTFELD: Every time he died.  WILLIAMS: That's a celebration, I'm telling you. And of course, today, there's a big celebration going on in Memphis at Graceland led by Presley's daughter Priscilla. So happy birthday, Elvis.  BREAM: Wait, Priscilla was the wife right?  WILLIAMS: Yes. Oh, I thought she was the -- oh, I'm sorry.  BREAM: Lisa is the wife -- or the daughter, right?  KILMEADE: Lisa Marie is the daughter.  BREAM: He was very young when they got married, but she was--  KILMEADE: Yes. If your name is Presley, we salute you.  WILLIAMS: All right, all right. Shannon, your turn.  BREAM: OK, all right. I'm slightly under protest. I'm giving you one more thing. And there's announcement that Prince Harry and Meghan are sort of announcing kind of that they're leaving the royal family in some way.  KILMEADE: How do you do that?  BREAM: OK, I'm not really sure but, Brian, the good news for you is there's an opening for a Prince.  GUTFELD: Fantastic.  KILMEADE: Prince Andrew can fill-in? Oh, he got kicked out too.  BREAM: Oh, no, Prince Andrew is out too. There's two prince openings right now. They say, we're going to balance our time between the U.K. and North America continuing to honor with a U, the British, you know, the honor with a U.  KILMEADE: They're going to get real jobs?  BREAM: Wait, wait. Honor our duty to the Queen and the Commonwealth and our patronage. They're going to raise their son with an appreciation for both sides of the pond. It's going to be great. To which I noticed that the Queen's office late there in London issued its own little statement saying -- and I actually read it with a British accent.  WILLIAMS: Go.  BREAM: We look forward to sharing the full details of this exciting next step in due course as we continue to collaborate with her majesty. No, that's not the queen. What the Queen says, the discussions are at an early stage. We understand the desire to take a different approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through.  PAVLICH: Family fight.  BREAM: So I feel like the Queen is not 100 percent on board with this.  WILLIAMS: Family fight. Thank you, Katie. Family Feud. All right, Greg.  GUTFELD: She is a homewrecker. I mean, she's a castle wrecker, a castle wrecker.  BREAM: A kingdom wrecker.  GUTFELD: All right, my podcast has Andrew Doyle. He22's a great comedian and the man behind the amazing Twitter handle Titania McGrath who's the scourge of woke culture. Just go to my Twitter feed. You'll find it.  It's fantastic. Now it's time for this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: I hate these people.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: I don't know why but boy, do I hate these people? Take a look at this. That's the Christmas tree outside my office. What's the date today?  January what?  WILLIAMS: 10th.  GUTFELD: What the hell is this tree still doing in my office?  WILLIAMS: Get rid of it.  GUTFELD: That's THE FIVE tree. It stinks. There's stuff falling off it.  WILLIAMS: Get rid of it.  GUTFELD: It bothers me that stupid hand. What a terrible top for a tree.  Get that thing out of here.  WILLIAMS: All right. All right. Scrooge. Brian, you're up.  KILMEADE: All right, here we go, a big announcement. Vice President Mike Pence will be on our show live tomorrow. He's Vice President of the United States, my favorite nation. He'll be on ""FOX & FRIENDS"" my favorite show after THE FIVE.  BREAM: What?  KILMEADE: And that'll be tomorrow. Make sure to be there. Also, I have an announcement. America: Great from the Start seen on Fox Nation, live on stage will be going to New York for the first time at the Space at Westbury 8:00. BrianKilmeade.com/events --  GUTFELD: Look at you.  KILMEADE: And in terms of reviews, just to give you an idea of what the show is about, a lot of people are writing it up. Time Magazine writes this. ""America: Great from the Start is the best live show from any Fox holes. Certainly better than Gutfeld's.""  GUTFELD: What? What?  KILMEADE: Entertainment Weekly, ""Brian's live shows are twice as funny as Greg's."" Vanity Fair, ""Unlike other Fox hosts, Brian doesn't need to Tom Shillue to carry his live show."" I wanted to do this on ""FOX & FRIENDS.""  WILLIAMS: Hey, this is -- this is not they way you treat my friend.  BREAM: Hey, Brian, you're a bestseller again.  WILLIAMS: Katie, Katie your turn.  PAVLICH: OK. So we all know that first responders are under a lot of pressure all the time, but one woman is doing her part to change that. Her name is Olivia Mead from Denver. She is the founder of Yoga for First Responders. And she was inspired to start the nonprofit organization in 2013 after working with veterans saying they go to work, see trauma, death, destruction, and loss, they go home to a mother or father, husband, and wife. So she works with firefighters, cops, veterans from all over the country to try and ease their stress and to calm their minds.  BREAM: What a great idea.  PAVLICH: So very cool that she's --  GUTFELD: Pagan.  WILLIAMS: Pagan?  GUTFELD: Pagan?  WILLIAMS: What's pagan?  GUTFELD: Get that yoga stuff out of the Fire Department.  WILLIAMS: By the way -- by the way -- by the way, for the record, it's January 8th.  PAVLICH: Yes.  WILLIAMS: All right. Set your DVRs. Never miss an episode of THE FIVE.  ""SPECIAL REPORT"", it's up next. Hey, Bret Baier.  Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

113,FOX,"Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden are locked in a growing feud over who can defeat Trump; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" January 7, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Hi. I'm Greg Gutfeld, with Katie Pavlich, Juan Williams, Lawrence Jones, and Sandra Smith, The Five. So Trump is no longer just a racist, sexist, or bot-nist, he is an assassinist.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And here we are in the assassination business again.  I'm sorry. This is the top general. He wasn't operational. He was a leader. We killed this guy. President of the United States, they used to hide from assassination responsibility. This president is bragging about it. And I don't think you are an assassin. Anyway, thank you so much.  This president is.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: I guess that's a step up from calling him a Republican. And after the left criticized Liz Warren for calling Soleimani a murderer, obviously hurting the feelings of Planned Parenthood. She fell in line quickly, also calling Trump an assassin, then came Bernie.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: But this guy is, you know, was as bad he was, an official of the Iranian government. And you unleash then -- if China does that, you know if Russia does that. You know, Russia has been implicated on the Putin -- with assassinating dissidents. So once you're in the business of assassination, you unleash some very, very terrible forces. And what I'm seeing now in this world, as a result of Trump's actions, more and more chaos, more and more instability.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: You've got to give them credit. They get on the same page faster than a horny congressman.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: Thank you.  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: You're welcome.  SANDRA SMITH, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Accurate.  GUTFELD: That was a mercy left. Well, if Trump's an assassin, what does make Obama, or any president who takes out a threat? Basically, it's just something new to call Trump. The fact is we kill bad guys all the time.  The problem is they just make more, and that sucks. But you can't blame Trump. He didn't put us there. And don't blame him for killing scum who like killing us. It's not a good look. Taking the side of the thugs with American blood on their hands, leave that to Colin Kaepernick. He needs the work. Now, the media's new take is what is going to happen next. They are predicting bad things, which oddly have actually already happened, dead contractors, cyber attacks, attacks on ships and embassies, and soldiers. If killing Soleimani makes the world worse than that, I'd like to know how letting him live would've made him better, anyone? But I get it, because taking out dirt bags who kill our troops is a good thing. The media must again focus on imagined bad things to come. But what if what you imagine has happened every day since Mannix was in primetime. Predicting that Iran is planning bad things is like predicting Michael Moore will eat a pie. No bookie is going to take your bet. And really, those who keep predicting the end have never been right. But that doesn't stop them. They want the apocalypse just to say I told you so. I mean, check out these butts.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He has perpetrated great suffering and misery in places like Lebanon and Yemen as well. But the issue is, was this a wise move?  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Soleimani was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American coalition service members. But even many of Soleimani's enemies admitted he was a military genius.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No one should be shedding any tears for Qasem Soleimani. But at the same time, I think that the fact, as Ambassador Sherman said, that the consequences of this could be unbelievable.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We are better off without him. But that had to be evaluated in the context of all the risks that come along with it.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: But, but, but. That's more buts than that Tommy John underwear commercial we keep playing everyday. They are snug, though. But hey, when the media keeps saying but, it's because they're talking out of their asses, which is why everything they say stinks. That's a little analogy I probably should've let die, Sandra. I apologize for that.  SMITH: I don't think there's anything wrong with the buts. Here's the problem. Those buts are not bad. Those are questions. And it's reasonable to ask questions in the wake of this. Even Joe Lieberman, we were talking about him on this program yesterday in the Wall Street Journal.  GUTFELD: Great butt.  SMITH: I don't know. Why can't Democrats admit that Soleimani's death makes us safer? He said that is a question that we should all be asking, and he was asking of his fellow Democrats. The buts are a bag (ph), Greg.  As Americans, we should all have questions. That is why Congress is being addressed right now and tomorrow, so that they can let them know what the intelligence was and what ultimately lead to this decision. Going back to Elizabeth Warren, though, she was following Bernie Sanders.  He was the first on the campaign trail to use the assassin verbiage, right?  Liz Warren then followed. First, she called him a murderer. Then, she said this is the assassination of a senior military official.  She was then asked by Meghan McCain on The View three times whether or not -- would you like to play?  GUTFELD: I would love to play it.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SANDRA: OK.  GUTFELD: Let's do that, Sandra.  SMITH: A terrorist?  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  MEGHAN MCCAIN, THE VIEW CO-HOST: You issued a statement calling Soleimani a murderer. Later, you issued a second statement saying that he was, quote, Issued a statement calling Soleimani are murderer and a second statement saying ""an assassination of a senior foreign military official."" I don't understand the flip-flop.  ELIZABETH WARREN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This isn't a change. They're truth. The question is what is the response that the president of the United States should make?  (CROSSTALK)  WARREN: He's part of a group --  (CROSSTALK)  MCCAIN: But is he a terrorist?  WARREN: He's part of a group that's been designated --  (CROSSTALK)  WARREN: Of course he is.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  SMITH: Excellent timing on that, Greg, but I'll tie it all together then.  Joe Lieberman -- and to what you just saw from Elizabeth Warren there. I think at the end of the piece in the Wall Street Journal, he asks, don't Democrats risk looking weak in the face of evil like this and not being able to make an admission like that?  WILLIAMS: Well, first of all, let me just say I am not going to fall for your flattery, Greg. My butt is my business. But I don't have a real but here, because I don't think Soleimani was a bad guy, right? Nonetheless -- I didn't say but.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: But I do think that it's irrational, as you were saying to ask about ramifications, consequences, and the like. Are we safer as a nation?  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: No, even you said just a moment ago that they are asking questions about what is to come.  LAWRENCE JONES, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: -- do believe he was assassinated?  WILLIAMS: No, because that would be extralegal. And I think that's what it's about, Lawrence. If you use that term and you're talking about taking an extra legal step, my question about it is this, if you're saying -- listen, he was a terrorist and he is an enemy of ours, an enemy of the American people, if we start killing all the bad guys, we've got a lot of people to kill. Are you going to go after Vladimir Putin? You want to go after some of these folks in Latin America?  JONES: I think the president said today they kill our people, and then we have to be sensitive to them and their culture? That's exactly what he said.  GUTFELD: I have that tape, too. My goodness, you people are on top of things. Do we have that tape or did today I dream that?  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: His past was horrible. He was a terrorist. He was a monster. And he is no longer a monster. He is dead.  And that is a good thing for a lot of countries. I don't anybody can complain about it. I don't hear too many people, other than politicians who are trying to win the presidency. Those are the ones that are complaining.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  JONES: Then you got the AP that are -- they played video on their Twitter page of the supreme leader crying. You have Michael Moore pinning an apology to the supreme leader. You have the New York Times writing their obituary. It is like this guy wasn't a terrorist and killing over 600 of our troops.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Everything you just said is news. Everything you just said is news. When you have the supreme leader reacting in that way to the man's death that is informing us about the reaction on the ground. How about the big protests?  JONES: Should we be apologizing to them?  WILLIAMS: Here's my point. Here's the point I was trying to make. Is the U.S. safer? Is Israel safer? Without the Iran deal, are we safer? Are we in a better position to fight ISIS?  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Wait a second, then. Tell me what the immediate threat was, because this guy has been going about plotting terrorist --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: That's true, he has.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: In the past, they killed people.  WILLIAMS: What was the immediate threat there?  (CROSSTALK)  KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Enough public information, Reuters has an amazing piece out about how Soleimani was Iraq in September and October sitting across the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, and talking about the way that they were going to use new Iranian militias that have not yet been detected by the United States to go after American troops both in Iraq and all over the region. So there's plenty of public information on that. The problem is not asking questions about what might happen next. The issue is that you are insinuating that the president and his entire administration isn't thinking about that, and that he didn't think through that if we take this guy out, and -- who was also in the car, who was another terrorist who was a really bad actor, smuggled in most of the IEDs from Iran to Iraq that blew up our troops, he was in the car as well. The intelligence on where they were at the right time was good. So now we are questioning, you know, what's going to happen next, of course. But the idea that we don't know or have a plan leading up to this is ridiculous.  And also, they keep saying, well, the president is incompetent. He doesn't know what the Iranians are going to do, blah, blah, blah. They've been on this guy. And they understand that the Obama administration appeased the regime over and over again. Soleimani had sanctions taken off of him as a result of the Iran deal, as a result of Barack Obama's negotiation on that deal. And yet, here we are today questioning whether Trump was the one who was appeasing the Iranians?  JONES: You were one of the Democrats saying President Trump always questions our intelligence agencies.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Wait a minute.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Stop the presses. Stop everything. Juan Williams is going to quote Tucker Carlson. Tucker Carlson said wait a minute. It was people like Lawrence who are saying this is the deep state. We can't cross the deep state. They're terrible.  Now, we love the deep state. Tucker Carlson, hats off!  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: It is, but the thing is I think that you can say both things.  You don't have to trust any intelligence. You don't have to trust it. But you can still kill the guy. You can do both.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: Your point was we don't trust the president, because we think the president isn't thinking this through.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: This president put sanctions, economic sanctions on, and had they had any effect, if so, why did he have to kill Soleimani?  (CROSSTALK)  PAVLICH: They have in fact. And the idea that we need to go is right now.  GUTFELD: I want to thank Juan for laughing at my joke about the page.  WILLIAMS: I want to thank Sandra for her compliment.  GUTFELD: We are very civil here at The Five. All right, coming up, Bernie borrowing a page from Trump to bash Biden, that's next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  WILLIAMS: It's turning into a 2020 brawl. Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden locked on a growing feud over who can defeat President Trump. And now, Sanders has taken a page right out of Trump's playbook. He is attacking Biden.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SANDERS: Joe Biden has been on the floor of the Senate, talking about the need to cut Social Security or Medicare or Medicaid. Joe Biden pushed a bankruptcy bill, which has caused enormous financial problems for working families. To get turnout, you need energy and excitement. And I just don't think that that kind of record is going to bring forth the energy that we need to defeat Trump.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WILLIAMS: So I think we got about less than 30 days to go before Iowa.  And you can start to see now that there is warfare among the Democrats.  They haven't been running ads attacking -- the attacks start. The question is with Biden and Bernie Sanders at the top of the pack. Are Bernie's attacks powerful enough to bring down Biden, Sandra?  SMITH: Does he have the branding power that Donald Trump had? You have to go back to 2016. Who did he brand low-energy? Donald Trump, who did he brand -- Jeb Bush. Bring the low-energy person, very low-energy, very low- energy kind of guy, bring back please clap moment, remember all of that?  Donald Trump had that power to brand the candidates.  We will see if he has the ability to do that. They are going to need energy, though. And when it comes to the senators that are running for president, and an impeachment trial coming, and if it looks like the Bill Clinton trial, you are talking every day, six days a week, all afternoon.  I mean, how is Bernie Sanders going to manage that? I mean, he's going to -- he can easily be opening himself up for criticism.  WILLIAMS: Lawrence, let me take you through Bernie's attack. The number one attack was about foreign policy. He said that, in fact, Biden had voted wrong on the Gulf war. He opposed it. Then he voted for the Iraq war. Of course, many Americans and certainly most Democrats think that was a mistake, no weapons of mass destruction and the like. And therefore, he says all these claims that he knows so much about foreign policy, hokum.  (CROSSTALK)  JONES: Well, yeah, he's a flip-flop. He's low-energy. You know, this is a guy that's been in politics into his 20s. He's been in the Senate since in his 30s. He has a long track -- he doesn't what he believes. That is the problem. If you go to the campaign rallies as I've been going to, the crowds are empty. And the people that say they want to vote for him are just saying he is just the best guy.  SMITH: You're talking about Biden?  JONES: Right, Biden, right. He just is the best candidate to be Trump. That is it. They have no policies that they support him really. They just think he is the best electable. Then you've got Bernie Sanders, who the Democrats should have gotten rid of a long time ago because he is a socialist. And he has hijacked their party.  He came back with supporters. He got AOC and the Squad with him now. And now, that is the energy. And so, you're -- Biden is going to be the nominee without a doubt. You can look at the polls. They're not shifting.  But he's going to much damage because those energy people, they're not going to come out and support Biden. Watch what I tell you.  WILLIAMS: That is part of Bernie's argument, Katie. And the other part of it is if you look at something like NAFTA, he will say, hey wait a second.  Joe Biden voted for NAFTA. How is that going to play in Michigan? How is that going to play in Wisconsin, Western Pennsylvania?  PAVLICH: That's why you see people like Elizabeth Warren saying she is going to vote for the USMCA, right? But Bernie Sanders, they tried to get rid of him in 2016, completely failed. And he came back even stronger.  And when you look at the grassroots effort, the fundraising numbers that are almost double what Joe Biden is bringing in, that translates into people on the ground are going to vote. And that is why you've seen President Obama with this rift in the party, the populist, non-establishment, grassroots versus the establishment, which is Joe Biden, him coming out and saying, look, I'm not endorsing everybody.  But I just want everybody know when there's a nominee we have to get behind them. Because you are absolutely right. The Bernie Sanders faction of the party and Elizabeth Warren's faction are so far left that they're worried that they will not come out and vote for someone like Joe Biden in order to beat Donald Trump. And then couple that with the problem of electability, and they banked on that before with Hillary Clinton. It doesn't always work.  WILLIAMS: All right. So Greg, here is the thing. A lot of people -- and what you often deride as the mainstream media --  GUTFELD: They make me sick, Juan.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: They are disgusting.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: He's been sick. So piling onto your joke, they also often discount Bernie. We just heard Lawrence.  GUTFELD: I agree.  WILLIAMS: But Bernie has the donors and he has the poll numbers.  GUTFELD: You know what, and you hit the right point. It's the media that believes they decide this, the way they decided Hillary, right? CNN decided that Bernie Sanders wasn't going to be the candidate, so they screwed him. And I think what they are trying to do now is they can't admit this could happen. But Bernie deserves this, and he really does. And he's right about Joe being low-energy. Joe is like a pen that's almost out of ink. So when you're writing -- you know you have a pen that's almost out of ink, then you put it down for a little bit, and you have to wait. Give it a little nap and you bring it up and it's back. He's like a car that requires the push of all your neighbors up the street to get it started.  WILLIAMS: If you're right then Biden will be the nominee.  GUTFELD: I don't think so.  WILLIAMS: Yeah, because this --  (CROSSTALK)  PAVLICH: I think it's going to make the convention.  GUTFELD: It's going to be a broken convention, and that is when Michelle comes in.  PAVLICH: More Hillary.  GUTFELD: No, no, it's going to be Michelle and Mayor Pete.  WILLIAMS: Hey. It is mid-summer dream? No, mid-winter dream here for the convention.  SMITH: I don't want to dream about Hillary.  WILLIAMS: Some of the media are not happy with Ricky Gervais after his takedown of Hollywood at the Golden Globes. We are going talk about it.  Have fun with it, have fun with all those rich, fancy, famous people right here next on The Five.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  SMITH: Comedian Ricky Gervais is being criticized after his takedown of Hollywood elites.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  RICKY GERVAIS, COMMEDIAN: Well, you say you're woke, but the companies you work for, I mean unbelievable, Apple, Amazon, Disney. If ISIS started a streaming service, you would call your agent, wouldn't you? So if you do win an award tonight, don't use it as a platform to make a political speech, right? You're in no position to lecture the public about anything.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  PAVLICH: Yup, he went there. Some media outlets are panning that performance as offensive, and others saying that nobody cared. One Vanity Fair writer even accusing the comedian of repeating a, quote, ""right wing talking point."" Ricky Gervais, however, is hitting right back on Twitter, saying, how the bleep can teasing huge corporations and the richest, most privileged people in the world to be considered right wing? Does he have a point, Greg?  GUTFELD: Number one, Ricky Gervais isn't a right-winger. He is a strong, outspoken liberal. He doesn't like Trump. But the thing is this isn't about right or left. This is about freedom of expression. And I think what should be uniting conservatives and liberals, or whatever stripe, is the rift that is going on among liberalisms between free expression and those who want to silence people on campus. And that is where Ricky Gervais is coming from. If you read his Twitter feed, he is expressing his own personal outrage over the cancel culture, about how people are constantly being attacked for things that they are saying. And it's very healthy that it comes from him, from somebody on the left. Nobody -- no liberal is going to listen to be because you're just going to say, Fox News, that guy, he trashes everybody. And, you know, they are right. But when he comes out and he is upset, Ricky Gervais is upset, because he is so confident in his liberal ideas that the refusal to listen to other ideas, which is happening right now in the regressive left, enrages him. It's an emphatic (ph) sign of weakness.  So it's the hard left that is actually destroying liberalism, not Trump-ism or not conservatism. And I think that's what is fuelling his fire and why he is so disgusted and angry. But do not mistake that for him becoming a conservative. He is as liberal. And the only politics he is really into, and very strongly, is animal rights. This is a guy who spends a lot of time dealing with humane issues with animals. But it's really about the rift between old-school liberals like Juan and the social justice creep that is trying to silence people like Juan.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: I would agree, because I have been muzzled.  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: So I understand what it is. And in that point, I would say yes.  By the way, I didn't even know who Ricky Gervais was.  GUTFELD: How dare you, the best sitcom ever, The Office.  WILLIAMS: I just didn't get it. I mean -- but around here, he is a star right now because of what he did. But the question is, one, do you really think that people didn't make political speeches after he spoke?  GUTFELD: They did.  WILLIAMS: They definitely did, so I don't think it had that impact. I think the impact he had was on people who are conservatives that finally here is somebody voicing --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: -- disdain for these rich, famous, arrogant people want to tell us.  SMITH: But Juan, back to the point, though. They're criticizing -- the Hollywood elites are criticizing him for right wing talking points. And he said what about going after large corporations and the rich, wealthy Hollywood actors --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: That was the point of what he did, to say this is legitimate speech and it's free speech coming from the left, hats off. But to the contrary, the support for him is coming from the right, which sees it as he was out there --  (CROSSTALK)  JONES: -- listening to the Dave Chapelle's of the world. This is about the mob. This is about -- people are so sick and tired of everything in their life being controlled by their past or if they decide to take a joke.  I have friends of mine that are -- majority of my friends are liberal. They tell me that they can't share a post that they may agree from Fox News because they'll get fired or they won't be invited to the next get together or something because that's how the mob works. And this is a guy who's a liberal that just wants freedom of expression.  PAVLICH: Yes. He's speaking out against the mob, but it's also about the fact that what he said was true. He's calling them out on behavior that they lecture the rest of America about not doing while they engage in it, and it's about elitism. They're allowed to do whatever they want, while the people that they think are not good enough or not rich enough, or aren't in the Hollywood Liberal circles, they're not allowed to participate for -- but that they have to be quelled and do what they think is the right thing to do, whether it's climate change or health care or anything else like that. And Ricky Gervais is a Liberal. He's not a woke leftist. And I think this is something that is pervasive throughout comedy, but also just for the roles in general. And by the way, there are people complaining about woke leftist but they also have the reaction.  SMITH: He tweeted out best reaction ever. It means a lot to me. I had a blast and thank (BLEEP) it's over.  GUTFELD: What do you think they bleeped there, Sandra?  SMITH: I don't know, Greg.  GUTFELD: What does it rhyme with?  SMITH: Use your imagination. All right, up next, cities now targeting dollar stores. Why some communities want to ban them?  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  PAVLICH: Nanny State Progressives have set their sights on a brand new target, dollar stores. Cities reportedly now moving to crack down on and in some cases ban discount stores that millions of Americans shop at. They blame the stores for people's poor diets. ""Communities like Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Fort Worth, Birmingham, and George's DeKalb County have passed restrictions on dollar stores prompting numerous other communities to consider similar curves. New laws and zoning regulations limit how many of these stores can open and some require those already in place to sell fresh food."" Greg?  GUTFELD: You know what this reminds me of -- and Juan is more closer in age than any of these people, when strip clubs, these stores are now -- like stores that sell inexpensive food to low-income families are now seen as like a pollutant in society. Like we're not having that strip club and -- but if you do, you're going to have the parking out back so we don't see everybody's cars because then we recognize everybody. Did you ever notice that, strip clubs? They always have the car parking lot in the back so can't see your husband's car.  SMITH: No, Greg.  GUTFELD: I don't know what I started thinking about. But the problem here is overabundance, right? We have solved hunger. And I know that people say, people go to bed hungry. But if you got to look at the statistics, you know, people are eating. And if you go and look in the street, you can tell people are eating. If you've walked down a cereal aisle, we have more -- there's different brands for every star in the sky. That's the issue here. But making it harder for low-income people to get their food which is probably high in carbs, that's not going to make their lives any easier.  You got -- and it smacks of elitism to think that because you don't shop at the dollar store, they shouldn't shop at the dollar store. Because you can afford the kale at Whole Foods, you know, they can't have macaroni and cheese at the dollar store. Sorry, when you have kids and you're on a fixed income, the dollar store is the place you're going to go. So you got to leave them alone, and maybe education at some point.  PAVLICH: I've been shopping at the dollar store forever. So, you know, shouldn't they be encouraging the government more competition and to have more grocery stores coming in next to the dollar store rather than trying to ban and rezone which only increases prices on everything?  JONES: Well, they could do that, or they could stick with their talking point, which is Democrats want everything to be affordable, right. And the Dollar Tree, I grew up on the Dollar Tree. It wasn't a place that we got food from but we got everything else from the Dollar Tree. And I think that the Democrats are actually stepping on their message with this because a lot of people need this stuff and they can't afford to go to the other places to get --  PAVLICH: Right.  GUTFELD: Especially if they're heavily taxed by Democrats.  JONES: Exactly. But there was also a study done about this, and it was in the Quarterly Journal of Economics. And they did a survey of all these places that had grocery stores, and the people end up not even going to the grocery stores. So again, I think they're stepping up -- stepping on their own message. And another thing, just because things are affordable, and we knew this when we shopped at the Dollar Tree, doesn't mean that it's quality, right?  The people know that they're not looking for quality, they're looking just something -- for something to get the job done, where they at -- where they're at financially.  PAVLICH: So Juan, one thing that the government doesn't want to ever talk about is the fact that the obesity crisis in America is their fault by subsidizing sugar, by doing the food pyramid --  GUTFELD: Yes.  PAVLICH: -- by telling people to eat things that they shouldn't. For decades, the government has been responsible for making people overweight.  GUTFELD: The pyramid was a lie, Juan, just like the moon landing.  PAVLICH: It's a total lie, it creates generations obese people. And now we have them again coming in and forcing the free market out on things that people can actually afford because they again think they know better about what Americans should be eating.  WILLIAMS: I'm taking this argument in. But I do think that ethanol for example -- like ethanol, I think I don't know why I pump that into my car except for the government is subsidizing farmers. And I think it's the similar thing with that emphasis that you're talking about with the food pyramid.  PAVLICH: Yes, and the sugar subsidies.  WILLIAMS: But here's my feeling about this is that there really are food deserts. And so yes, I've stopped to shop at -- I think the food version of the dollar store is Dollar General. And when you go in there, you know what, man, the cuts of meat, they're all fatty, you can't find fish, you can't find fresh vegetables and fresh fruits.  GUTFELD: Oh, I love that.  SMITH: So what are you suggesting though?  WILLIAMS: Because it has an economic impact, to pick up on Greg's point about the strip store. If you have drug dealers in the neighborhood, it makes it more difficult, Sandra, for people to have retail stores. And if you have a dollar store there, people are going to say well, everybody is going to go to the --  JONES: Juan, you can't (INAUDIBLE) on sale.  WILLIAMS: No. But what I'm saying to you is everybody is saying it's cheaper and, you know, I'll fill up on this, they don't go to stores that in fact offer more nutrition, better quality food. And I guess that makes a difference in your life and your --  JONES: I grew up on that. I turned out just fine.  WILLIAMS: You're different at all.  SMITH: Juan, you believe in a free market, you believe in capitalism --  GUTFELD: He's tall, Juan.  WILLIAMS: Yes.  GUTFELD: I'm short, I ate better than him.  (CROSSTALK)  SMITH: -- when you're talking about banning stores and deciding what's best for people.  WILLIAMS: No, no, wait a second, wait a minute, hold on, Sandra. I believe in the free market, but the free market does have some negative consequences like we're talking about the strip store or we could talk about prostitution in your neighborhood. This has a bad impact on your neighborhood.  GUTFELD: No, I can't -- I can't say there's prostitution coming out of the dollar store.  WILLIAMS: I didn't say that.  GUTFELD: That's a hell of dollar store.  WILLIAMS: Stay at it --  SMITH: Juan, I think you have to acknowledge that there is a lot of people in this country who are out of touch with families that are living paycheck.  JONES: That's exactly --  SMITH: Who go into these stores and it is a convenience for them to not think about how much they can spend. If they know they have $10.00 in their pocket, they can buy 10 things.  WILLIAMS: No, they will spend -- they will spend the $10, but it's going to be more potato chips, high sugar, high salt --  SMITH: And you -- and you know better how they should use their money.  WILLIAMS: No, no, no. It's not that I know --  GUTFELD: What stores would --  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMS: (INAUDIBLE) said no giant cokes or whatever, remember that? I don't think that is the right approach because it takes away choice but it doesn't --  SMITH: There is concern that they're making decisions because the dollar stores are undercutting other retailers --  WILLIAMS: That's what I'm saying to you. It undercuts the possibility of a better quality food store --  JONES: No, because the study shows, Juan, that when they put those stores, that people didn't go there because -- by the way, by the way, the second thing is, is that if you have those stores there and people aren't buying those products, that product goes bad, it's perishable, which means that business is not --  GUTFELD: It's like cinnamon Pepsodent. Nobody buys cinnamon Pepsodent so it ends up at the Dollar Tree.  SMITH: What I will say -- what I will say about the economics of the stores because there's a lot of research on them, do your research.  Because sometimes the dollar store, even though it's a dollar, it's a smaller quantity, and it may be cheaper at another store, I'm not saying this is the best option, but it should be an option for people.  WILLIAMS: Correct. And even what Lawrence said is not good -- anyway, go ahead.  PAVLICH: The ""FASTEST SEVEN"" is up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  JONES: Welcome back. Time for the ""FASTEST SEVEN."" All right, first up, robots are supposed to make life easier, but we can figure out if this is cool or creepy. Take a look at this Samsung tiny new personal assistant named Ballie.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ballie patrols your home to keep you safe. He is a fitness assistant, a new friend to your kids, and pets, and a camera that records and stores special moments.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  SMITH: Creepy.  JONES: Why do we need this, Sandra?  GUTFELD: I can't wait.  JONES: It's kind of weird, right?  GUTFELD: I don't know. It's like the beginning of a great horror film.  But we think about it -- you know, think about you know how technology changes the present and the past. Imagine 2100, when your great-grandkids look at pictures of our time, they go wait, humans carried your luggage?  SMITH: Yes.  GUTFELD: That is disgusting. Humans actually drove you to the airport?  You're slave drivers. How dare you? Because right now what's going to happen is technology is going to do all of these things and we're going to look really bad.  JONES: But Katie, it looks like -- it looks like we're trying to find the issue like why do we need this?  PAVLICH: Last time we talked about robots in the show I got in big trouble so --  GUTFELD: What did you say?  PAVLICH: I'm not going to say what I say.  GUTFELD: What did you say? Just turn a glass of water on him.  PAVLICH: I said, throw them away. I did this. Get rid of them. They're bad.  GUTFELD: See, that's robotics. When they become conscious -- when they become conscious, you're going to be seen as bigot and they're going to come for you.  PAVLICH: I don't care about their feelings. It's fine. I have a shotgun.  WILLIAMS: Can I leave?  JONES: That's good. That's good. What do you think about this?  PAVLICH: The robots, they're going to come attack me.  WILLIAMS: Well, I think the next step actually is implanted, right? They got this thing rolling around your house following you, taking your picture. I just think that's crazy. But guess what, I think it's going to be a required accessory for the upper class very shortly.  GUTFELD: And it's going to be cheap -- it's going to get cheaper, everybody laughing.  JONES: All right, next up, a Florida woman ended up in jail over McDonald's dipping sauces. When employees tried to charge her for extra sauce, she threatened them by ""any means necessary.""  SMITH: She wanted that sauce.  JONES: Yes. She's trying to get them.  SMITH: I have a similar thing with wasabi at sushi restaurant. It's the more the better for me. And I was -- they kind of looking at me funny when I asked for extra. So any means necessary.  GUTFELD: I'm just happy that it's -- finally it's a Florida woman. I'm so tired of the Florida man. It's always the Florida man who's doing things.  SMITH: Fair enough.  GUTFELD: But McDonald's shouldn't run out of sauce.  JONES: I don't like this.  GUTFELD: That's like me running out of analogies here.  JONES: They charge -- but they charge you for the sauces. That's the deal. Like Chick-fil-A gives you the sauces. I take this --  PAVLICH: This is flying. Like just charge me the full amount.  JONES: That's right.  PAVLICH: Don't charge me the extra. Like put the cost of the sauce in the menu, you know.  (CROSSTALK)  PAVLICH: I don't want to pay extra.  JONES: Sometimes you like to soak the chicken in the sauce. I don't think you should be judged for.  GUTFELD: Sometimes I don't even use chicken.  PAVLICH: The packets are too small too.  WILLIAMS: I love you as a rapper. Katie, I'm loving it. I'm loving it at McDonald's.  PAVLICH: (INAUDIBLE)  WILLIAMS: You know, I just -- I don't understand why anyone gets so excited about it. I don't think they charge you more for the wasabi, but I mean she is going to come back and threaten people Malcolm X style by any means necessary?  JONES: Well, maybe she shouldn't have threatened them, but I mean this --  WILLIAMS: You shouldn't have hurt --  (CROSSTALK)  GUTFELD: That was -- that was me this morning.  WILLIAMS: She should not have threatened them, Lawrence.  JONES: But I understand her frustration. All right, finally, it's a movie so bad you have to get high to get through it. The Washington Post talked to people who took mind-altering drugs before going to see Cats. Some said they love the experience but one review called it the most terrifying experience of my life.  SMITH: Was that the movie -- was that person on the drugs or not because the movie got horrible ratings.  JONES: I think it was terrible. I didn't get to see but I saw some of the previews and said I would never go see that.  PAVLICH: You're judging a movie by its cover, Lawrence?  JONES: Yes.  GUTFELD: I'm judging it by its fur. You know, it's -- it is weird because when you take a drug while watching Cats, it immediately turns it into a normal film like Bond film or -- I take drugs when I watch Love Actually.  WILLIAMS: That's because you hate that movie.  GUTFELD: I do.  SMITH: I don't ever take drugs lightly.  JONES: Sandra, should --  GUTFELD: You mean you're a moderate user?  SMITH: I don't drug use. I don't treat it like that.  JONES: But should we keep Broadway on Broadway and not in the theater? I mean, that's just me.  PAVLICH: Yes. I agree. I saw a mess in that theater and that was really rough.  GUTFELD: I don't know.  PAVLICH: It's bad.  JONES: Juan.  GUTFELD: Juan goes to plays all the time.  WILLIAMS: I do. I do.  PAVLICH: I'd like them in person. Broadway is great. But you know, it doesn't always translate well.  JONES: Would you go see this right here?  WILLIAMS: My wife went to see it.  JONES: What does she think?  WILLIAMS: I think the company gave her the free tickets and she said she couldn't take it. She said, if I was there, I would have walked out.  JONES: She speaks her mind.  WILLIAMS: She did.  GUTFELD: She just got her in trouble too. That company is not giving her anything.  WILLIAMS: Well, I think -- anyway, I do think that if you went to see like the Joker, which is one of the top movies, right, or John Rich which is that violence --  JONES: That's a good movie.  GUTFELD: John Rich, no, John -- that's the country music singer.  WILLIAMS: Oh, no, no, no.  PAVLICH: Richard Jewel.  WILLIAMS: Anyway, a lot of these movies, I think the young people go in there and they are high you know, because I mean, that's the way they got them.  JONES: If I got to get high to -- I don't do drugs, but if I had to get drugs to see a movie, I'm not going to go see it. That's just the bottom of it. Anyway, we got to go. ""ONE MORE THING"" is up next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  GUTFELD: Back with ""ONE MORE THING."" I'm going to go first. Greg's animals on Roombas. All right, I have three videos of animals on Roombas.  You guys get to vote after we get through them on which one's the best.  Let's go to number one. Check out first animal on Roomba. Looks like it's a baby Billy goat working around the old farm garage in Florida. Do farms have garages? I don't know. He seems like he's a bit confused but he's doing OK there. Check him out. Why don't we go to the second Roomba candidate? This is a hideous little opossum. You know what, he looks like a demon pope.  JONES: Yes, that's nasty.  GUTFELD: Like he looks like -- he looks like a vampire, very hairy, but they're cute when they're babies, aren't they?  JONES: No, they're not.  GUTFELD: No they're not, opossums? OK, finally, this is my favorite.  Let's go to this little sucker here. He's got the right look. He's doing like a centerfold for vintage playboy enjoying on his -- on his belly there. He looks like he's stirring it which I find especially. OK.  JONES: Oh, he's relaxed.  GUTFELD: He's relaxed. All right, Katie?  PAVLICH: Bulldog.  GUTFELD: Bulldog, one.  WILLIAMS: Wait a minute, you can't pick favorites. You can't bias the jury. I'll go with number one.  GUTFELD: The goat. Lawrence?  JONES: The dog.  SMITH: Oh that poor opossum, I'll take it.  GUTFELD: I got to go with the Bulldog, so I think the Bulldog wins. All right, now it's you, Juan.  WILLIAMS: All right. And you know, there's Super Bowl wins, there's NBA Finals wins, World Series wins, and then there's Matt Driscoll win. Watch as Matt crosses the finish line after winning a three and a half year fight with acute leukemia. The 19-year-old had been undergoing chemotherapy for years during which his weight fell almost 60 pounds, leaving at one point weighing less than 100 pounds. The former athletes stayed in touch with friends and family including his high school football team. The players they were pumped up to hear their former teammate now wants to get back to playing football and basketball.  Congratulations, Matt, from all of us here at Fox on winning the fight of your life. He's cancer-free folks.  JONES: Way to go, dude. Look at that. That's good.  GUTFELD: Sandra, what you got?  SMITH: All right, so you know you go to the checkout at CVS Pharmacy --  GUTFELD: Yes.  SMITH: And the receipts this long. Well, someone on Etsy has gotten very creative and there are sellers that are capitalizing on it. They're making scarfs that look like the long CVS receipts. There's even a customizable option where buyers can print anything that they would like to onto that scarf despite issuing an announcement 2013 on Twitter that those receipts, by the way, would be reduced in size. They said they're going to cut them down by 25 percent.  GUTFELD: Still not enough.  SMITH: They're still -- there's still long. You stand there. It slows down the line, have you notice that, because everybody is waiting for these receipts to print. Well, they're having fun with it. You can buy a scarf now that looks like one.  GUTFELD: You know what, I don't even buy toilet paper at CVS anymore. I just get the receipt.  PAVLOV: That's very economical.  GUTFELD: Thank you, Katie. Thank you.  PAVLICH: So it's my turn.  GUTFELD: Yes.  PAVLICH: Yes. An alarmed neighbor heard this happening and call the police. Take a listen.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Let me out. Let me out.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  GUTFELD: What's going on?  PAVLICH: All right, so you can hear someone saying, let me out, help. And thinking a woman was screaming in the house and being held captive, the neighbor called because any good neighbor does that. But it turned out to be a parrot. And four officers responded to the Florida residence.  JONES: No way.  PAVLICH: The parrot's owner was working in his driveway. And he calmly said that the bird, Rambo -- this is what he said to the officers.  GUTFELD: Come on.  PAVLICH: They don't have it. All right, anyways, he said that Rambo yell sometimes help, help, let me out because he taught him that as a kid because the bird is 40 years old so --  SMITH: Wow.  PAVLICH: There you go. Good job, neighbor.  SMITH: Did they check on the parrot just to --  GUTFELD: Maybe that was just a great story. Just the parrot, but don't go in the basement.  JONES: All right, so you've heard of people seeing the Virgin Mary on a piece of toast, but what about a manatee on a chicken nugget. All right, so a Florida woman bought this chicken nugget at a local grocery store, and now she's selling it online for $5,000. If you don't think it resembles a manatee, Melinda says it looks better in person and that any proceeds from the sale will be donated to manatee related charities.  PAVLICH: But she got sauce? Free sauce?  JONES: It's crazy. $5,000?  GUTFELD: I'd bid $1,500 tops for that very, very cute little manatee. All right, speaking of manatee, set your DVRs.

114,FOX,"Some of President Trump's critics claim the Iran strike is an effort to distract Americans from impeachment; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" January 6, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Juan Williams, along with Dagen McDowell, Pete Hegseth, Sandra Smith, and Greg Gutfeld. It is 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is ""The Five."" Oh, boy. We have a jam-packed show, including new questions in the death of Jeffrey Epstein. Stunning new autopsy and jail cell photos have been released. Plus, comedian Ricky Gervais' calls out Hollywood during his opening Golden Globe speech. All that's coming up, but first, the battle raging in Washington over President Trump's decision to take out Iran's top general. Trump ramping up his rhetoric as Iran vows revenge, and Democrats not happy with the move. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BERNIE SANDERS (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Tragically, his actions now put us on the path to another war. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER: He's been erratic and unsuccessful in almost every previous foreign policy endeavor. This one is the most dangerous of all. ELIZABETH WARREN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We are not safer today than we were before Donald Trump acted. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We seem to have accomplished what Soleimani was trying to do but couldn't so. In death, he's actually accomplished his goal. JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is and was an enormous escalation. PETE BUTTIGIEG (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Taking out a bad guy is not a good idea unless you are ready for what comes next. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: And some Democrats are saying that drone strike was a distraction from impeachment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WARREN: I think the question people reasonably ask is next week Donald Trump faces the stark potentially of an impeachment trial, and why now? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This action was taken more in President Trump's self interest rather than our national interest. We've had, you know, damning developments in just the last day where emails came out that made it very clear that they covered up the real reason behind the withholding of the hundreds of millions of millions of dollars to Ukraine. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: Pete, when you hear the Democrats saying, wait. Why did he do this now? Is this related to impeachment, what do you think? PETE HEGSETH, GUEST CO-HOST: I think with friends like these Democrats, who need the Iranians? I mean, ultimately, this is the resistance continuing across -- overseas as adamantly as we've seen here at home. Listen, you may not like President Trump. You may have voted for the impeachment in the House. But if you are someone like Comrade Cortez -- Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeting -- saying that a tweet from the president threatening the Iranians is in it of itself a war crime. You've lost your mind. WILLIAMS: Wait a second. Wait a second. That was related to destroy the cultural -- HEGSETH: Fifty two sites, one of which might be cultural. Actually -- by the way, I don't care about Iranian cultural sites. And I'll tell you why. If they could -- if Iran could -- if you understand the Islamic Republic of Iran of Islamists, if they could, if they had the power, they would destroy every single one of our cultural sites and build a mosque on top of it. If you don't understand the nature of our enemy, you are foolish about who you are pointing out and whether or not you are happy that Soleimani is dead. This guy's exported terrorism for that regime for 40 years. And the fact that Democrats in this country can't take a pause to say this is a good thing, now, let's figure out how to prevent an Iranian bomb. They go straight to politics and it's shameful. WILLIAMS: So Sandra, this raises an important point. What's next? Because I think a lot of people think that maybe the president acted impetuously without thinking about what consequences may come from taking out Soleimani. SANDRA SMITH, GUEST CO-HOST: To repeat the words of Mitch McConnell on the Senate floor just a few moments ago, just convened this afternoon. He said they rushed to split hairs about intelligence before being briefed on it. They rushed to downplay Soleimani's evil while presenting our own president as the villain. And I think that's an important point to be made here. While he is a Republican senator, Juan, the questions over the intelligence behind the president's decision were questioned before we even knew what was behind it, or the details behind it. That has changed. Today, we just learned that there is going to be a Senate briefing on Wednesday, where the Department of Defense, Mark Esper, the Secretary. He is going to brief -- it's going to be -- I believe a house-wide briefing on the intelligence behind this. So why condemn this before we even know why the president made the decision to do it? WILLIAMS: Greg, the question would be why don't we know. GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Why don't we know what? WILLIAMS: Why the president acted? GUTFELD: We do know. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: You know what? I just got back from the flu, so I'm understanding that Trump did something? WILLIAMS: You got it. GUTFELD: All right. So what did you -- wait a minute, so he killed a murderous, homicidal maniac who killed 600 Americans and he is the bad guy, right? Trump is the bad guy. So this is why people are saying what do you do next? Because what was now was correct. No one can question the actual actions of Trump. So instead, you have to shift into what ifs. I will admit right now that absolutely no expert on Iran or the Middle East. But I will happily tell you neither is anybody else. There has never been any proof of success from any of the analysts that you see on television telling you that they know what's going to happen next or what happened in the past. They know nothing. So take everything with a grain of salt. Every apocalyptic prediction has been wrong, including -- hey, moving the embassy to Jerusalem. Remember that was supposed to be the end of the world. And also, I love it. I love it. I love it how people are saying, oh, now those Iranians are really pissed. They're really going to come after us. Like when they were killing our troops, they were deeply admiring us. I mean -- and it's going to restart their nukes like they had actually had stopped them? They are like your dirt bag cousin's drug habit. He's telling you he's stopped. No, he just moved it to another house. So the idea that we somehow kicked the hornet's nest is an absolute lie. The hornets are already out of the nest and they've been stinging us forever. Case in point, I was watching our great leader Neil Cavuto, right? He was doing a segment on trying to predict what the Iranians might do to us in terms of cyber attacks, on like banking institutions, and stuff like that. And so he cited what they have done in the past, meaning they already attacked us many, many times. Interesting, don't you think? Don't you think that would play into the decision-making to take out this guy? They already attacked us? We took out their Charles Manson and it's on us? Sorry, we didn't escalate anything. Lastly, we keep seeing all these shots of these large crowds of mourners. Mass protests in Iran is what you call Thursday, OK? Death to -- saying death to America, that is their palates, all right? So, you know, when somebody said wow, check out their mass protests in Iran. That's like saying the line at Chick-fil-A. It's always there, OK? So we are used to this. It's been going on since the revolution. They treated us like crap. You were right. We took out a bad guy. And what's interesting about this is what's seen as heinous under Trump would've been seen as bold under Obama. WILLIAMS: Well, in fact, it's an interesting point that Greg makes, Dagen, because President's Trump -- sorry President's Bush and Obama decided not to take this step. They could have. When the option was presented to them, they said they weren't interested in the consequences, the idea of going to war potentially with Iran. Now, today, as people are asking these questions about the intelligence. You see that the American public, specifically the Democrats are, like, we aren't sure what President Trump's bases was for this. And, of course, Americans have a lot of questions after 9/11, after weapons of mass destruction in Iraq proved not to be there. So what do you think? DAGEN MCDOWELL, GUEST CO-HOST: I think the why now is that Soleimani's proxy force targeted U.S. troop 11 times in the last two months. They killed an American contractor and stormed a U.S. embassy, an act of war. That's your why now. There was restraint after the attack on an American drone that downed it. There was restraint after an Iranian attack on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities, but not now. Here's your redline for the terrorists who killed Americans with impunity. Your redline is death. Your punishment is death. And President Trump did not forecast what that redline was. But here it is. I want to point out just a couple more quick things. President Obama's policy with Iran was to funnel money into the hands of this terrorist. The Quds forces, a terrorist organization, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard, a terrorist organization. At least initially $1.7 billion in pallets of cash sent in the dark of night that we wouldn't even know about without the Wall Street Journal reporting, that went straight into Soleimani's hands and straightened to killing Americans and straightened to fomenting terrorism around the region. That's the why now. That's why he's dead. WILLIAMS: Right. It sounded to me, is what's interesting is that we are, you know, we had in terms of the Iran deal, a promise and the Iranians were keeping it. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: Hang on. Yes, in fact, I think it's not just me. I think much of the world. But not only were they not doing that, and now they've pulled out of the deal. But now, we have unrest throughout the Middle East. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: Wait. Juan, we have unrest in the Middle East? I've never heard of that before. WILLIAMS: We have unrest directed at us -- GUTFELD: Wait, unrest directed at us in the Middle East. WILLIAMS: Imagine President Trump sending 350 Americans now in -- he was pulling out a moment ago. (CROSSTALK) HEGSETH: -- to actually reinforce an embassy? That's a novelty. WILLIAMS: No, well, hey. I just think we were trying to get out. A surging 2020 Democrat putting major pressure on Joe Biden's front runner status, plus you won't not believe who Judge Judy just endorsed for president, that's all next on ""The Five."" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) SMITH: The battle for 2020 heating up as we begin a new year, new polling showing Bernie Sanders surging in both Iowa and New Hampshire. And a separate new national poll showing Michael Bloomberg rising to a tie for third place, in comes as Joe Biden continues to stumble on the campaign trail. Here's Biden contradicting his own story of how he urged former President Obama to delay the mission that killed Osama Bin Laden. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: As commander-in-chief, if you were ever handed a piece of intelligence that said you can stop an imminent attack on Americans, but you have to use an air strike to take out a terror leader. Would you pull the trigger? BIDEN: Well, we did. The guy's name was Osama Bin Laden. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And weren't you - didn't you tell president Obama not to -- (CROSSTALK) BIDEN: I didn't. And he said I have to make a decision. What is your opinion? Mr. President, my suggestion is don't go. We have to do two more things to see if he's there. (END VIDEO CLIP) SMITH: Interesting look back there. Plus, Judge Judy saying she is now backing Michael Bloomberg and put the campaign trail for the billionaire. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JUDGE JUDY SHEINDLIN, FAMILY COURT JUDGE: To define Mike Bloomberg as just another rich guy is one of the greatest injustices of this political campaign that we're in. Because Mike Bloomberg is the only one of the candidates who has experience governing and managing. (END VIDEO CLIP) SMITH: What does she have -- 10 million people a day watch her? Could that have a big influence on Michael Bloomberg's run here, Juan? WILLIAMS: Was that Ruth Bader Ginsburg? It took me a second. But, yeah, I mean, first of all, what's interesting about her, Judge Judy, is her audience is literally suburban women, right, who are the be-all and end-all for political consultants in this presidential race. She's not a Hollywood endorsement or a New York Times endorsement, which I would throw out, right? She's actually a cultural endorsement for people who really have a lot of respect for Judge Judy. She thinks she tells a lot of folks. Hey, stop with the foolishness. Straighten yourself out. Do right. Get right with God. I mean, that's where she comes across on television, and that's why she's the highest-paid person. SMITH: So you're suggesting that could go a long way with Michael Bloomberg and the working class voter? (CROSSTALK) MCDOWELL: I wish she was running instead of Michael Bloomberg. Because I'm not going to disparage Judge Judy, but Mike Bloomberg is going to need some help. What's he spent, at least of $100 million on advertising so far? It's like online dating. You look really good on an online profile. You know, you basically clean up all your head shots. And you look great. You Google lettuce and Bloomberg, there's an ad for Mike Bloomberg running for president. But once you start seeing him in person, on the campaign trail, he only pretty much likes hanging around super rich people, and I don't mean even Judge Judy rich. I mean multibillionaires. He's kind of jerky. And eventually, people -- that's going to turn them off. GUTFELD: Have you seen pictures of him? He is the least comfortable person trying to look comparable in the history of the world. He'll be standing in a subway. He will be leaning. He was staring at a plate of ribs today, that he tweeted that out. He was looking at the ribs as though it was made out of, you know, I don't know, baby fur. But the point is, is that, like, running against the most authentic candidate probably in history. Trump is -- you can love him, you hate him, but he's Trump. He's Trump in pictures. He's Trump on Twitter. He's Trump on the street. These people, they don't know what they are until they are asked a question. And when you ask Biden a question, you never know what you are going to get. It's usually a stream of consciousness answer that sounds like a child's dream. SMITH: What about Joe Biden? Because you do see Bernie Sanders going into Iowa and New Hampshire pretty well positioned. HEGSETH: Bernie Sanders, I believed he'd been -- I believe from the beginning he will be the nominee. He hit some bumps in the road. I think he's the authentic articulation. He's the closest thing to authentic that the left has to offer, even though he's a wacky socialist. I mean, but, they keep going back to Biden, wanting him to be the front runner. But they watch Biden. And he literally wanders around the stage while whispering, wondering what state he's in, and wondering what position he would take, while President Trump yells out where's Hunter. And Biden yells where's Barack? You know, he was supposed to be my boy. He was supposed to have my back. I was supposed to be the extension of those years that everyone cared for. You couldn't walk outside right now. You probably agree with me on this one, and find an enthusiastic Biden voter. Yes, Joe, he's my man. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: Not even Joe. HEGSETH: Not even Joe. WILLIAMS: I agree with you to this extent. I don't think that he has that kind of populist energy that Bernie has -- that's why Bernie gets the big money from the small donors, and Joe Biden has been struggling with that, always done well in this cycle in terms of fundraising. But the problem for Bloomberg and also for Bernie is Biden continues to lead. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: -- at the top of Iowa, New Hampshire. Look at that. MCDOWELL: No, he's leading in Nevada by nine points over Warren. And he's leading in South Carolina by nearly 19 percent of points over Liz Warren and Bernie Sanders. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: Why do you think he said that he approved the killing Bin Laden with something that's so easy to check? WILLIAMS: Yeah, it's not true. GUTFELD: Yeah, I know. WILLIAMS: I mean, the best argument that Biden can make is I made sure President Obama had the other side of the view. But the fact that he -- he said no. MCDOWELL: He probably doesn't remember. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: Maybe he thinks Bin Laden is somebody else. WILLIAMS: May be he's modelling himself on Trump. GUTFELD: Bin Louden, his accountant. He's putting a hit on his accountant. SMITH: Shocking photos of Jeffrey Epstein's autopsy raising new questions about his death. Hear from the medical expert who says that there could have been foul play. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HEGSETH: Shocking new questions in the death of Jeffrey Epstein. We have brand new photos from inside his Manhattan jail cell on the day he died. They show piles of sheets and bedding scattered around, and several nooses made from bed sheets like this one. Fox News has also obtained photos of Epstein's autopsy. Now viewer warning, the image we are about to show you is graphic. It shows a bloody line around the middle of Epstein's neck. The new evidence leading former New York City medical examiner, Michael Baden, to question the Epstein's death was a suicide. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL BADEN, NEW YORK CITY MEDICAL EXAMINER: The closing out of the case as a suicide so quickly was premature. My concern is that the evidence is that it's not a hanging, that it's a homicidal strangulation. Who did it? How did it happen? You can't tell. But the findings are not -- more indicative of homicide than accident, than suicide. (END VIDEO CLIP) HEGSETH: Sandra, you had the doctor on your program today. That's where the clip came from. What questions still hang out there? Whoa, I didn't mean that one. (CROSSTALK) SMITH: I think it's important to say that he's not concluding that he was killed in a jail cell, but he says that he believes, as you just heard him say, was premature to say that this was suicide. So he's been hired by the family, the brother of Jeffrey Epstein to further investigate this. He talks about the ligature. He says -- and you saw a picture of it there, the one that was supposedly used to hang himself. And he said it doesn't match the wound on his neck. That's more indicative of a rope or a cord. It's more of a narrow indentation on his neck. Also said there was no blood found on the noose, and he was back to his original theory at how the fractures in his neck did not match of a suicidal attempt with the noose. It looks like something else. HEGSETH: Inconsistent. He also had a cellmate who was pulled out beforehand. Greg, there's a lot of theories as it pertains to this case. What do you make of -- GUTFELD: A bunch of fake noose. HEGSETH: Well played. GUTFELD: Thank you. Look, I think the noose actually was a belt from one of Hillary's pantsuits. I like that joke. Anyway, the question -- (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: The question about suicide is less relevant than the absolute ambivalence of a media to pursue this story while the major players are still out there. I find that kind of interesting. I do think now it is suicide. There were multiple nooses there, multiple nooses. Generally, a person who commits suicide would have multiple nooses in case one breaks, right? I don't know if you would stage something you would stage it with multiple nooses. I do love Dr. Baden. He was Dr. Death on Red Eye. There was 100 appearances. But he does have kind of a dog in his hunt because it represents the brother. And there must be some insurance claim that's involved in that. The real victim here, of course, is Shakira. She was also on 60 Minutes and no one cares. Did any of you watch the Shakira segment? It was fantastic, because she actually confessed to killing Epstein. Nobody knows because they didn't watch. HEGSETH: Nobody knows because they didn't watch. I don't know if you watched, Dagen, or not. But you've also got details like the guard who found Epstein's body has yet to be interviewed. He has lawyered up. So when you look at the information we've learn, these photographs, the interview with Dr. Baden. Where do you make of where we are? MCDOWELL: That the actual victims of Jeffrey Epstein deserve answers about this. Virginia Roberts Giuffre, probably the better known of all -- the myriad of victims of Jeffrey Epstein. She said I'm glad his death is being investigated. There are too many anomalies surrounded by his incarceration and his death to be ignored. Survivors deserve answers as to what happened to this monster for us to never get to take his freedom away as he took ours. She said that on Twitter. But again, we are still watching. Ghislaine Maxwell, According to Julie K. Brown, the report down at the Miami Herald, who -- Epstein would never have been indicted by the Southern District of New York if not for her reporting on the victims. Ghislaine Maxwell has been under investigation by federal authorities since March of last year. There are a lot of other people that they ought to look into -- former model management guy? I could go down the list. GUTFELD: Don't go down too far, OK? MCDOWELL: No. HEGSETH: If you look at the 60 Minute segment, I mean, really it was new photographs revealed. Who has the motivation to move this story forward and sort of try to prove that he didn't kill himself? WILLIAMS: Well, people who want money from his estate right now are in line to collect some of that money because he killed himself. But they wouldn't be if, in fact, someone else killed him to prevent it. And, of course, there's all these conspiracy theories out there. I think, you know, because there are lot of people in the left that -- we're talking about Clintons and all these kind of stuff and all these famous men -- (CROSSTALK) HEGSETH: That's when questions get asked -- WILLIAMS: But the fact is, Pete, the part that really stops this in my mind is the New York medical examiner -- suddenly have they been bought? They said this was suicide. So you have to say somehow -- whoever is involved in this conspiracy had bought off the New York medical examiner. 60 minutes, I consider to be a, you know, first-class organization. I don't know why they put their money and credibility on the line with this, but they clearly did yesterday. They're new -- there's new evidence so it's interesting. I'm sure the viewers want to see it. But to suggest that this is now part of some grand conspiracy, I think is way beyond the line. SMITH: But Juan, to be clear, initially the medical examiner's office could not conclude what happened. They needed more time to investigate. WILLIAMS: But They have concluded it. SMITH: There were some inconsistencies is that the family might want to know answers why there was no videotape, why there was not cameras working, why those guards were not on duty and fell asleep. MCDOWELL: And why the victims would never get their day in court to face him. HEGSETH: That segment, one of the -- a former federal warden said, a monumental failure at all levels. That leads people to ask questions, which leads to theories and now we're talking about -- GUTFELD: I blame Trump. HEGSETH: He's got it. All right, coming up Ricky Gervais. If you missed this, you got to see it. Calls out Hollywood's elite right to their faces. Do not miss Greg's monologue on that next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GUTFELD: Television has a way of uniting Americans in a way nothing else can. The staged moon landing, the 1980 Winter Olympics when we beat the Germans in volleyball. And last night's Golden Globes when Ricky Gervais gave a bloody nose to the greatest villain. There he said everything you ever wanted to say to that self-obsessed pile of pulsating flesh known as Hollywood, including this beautiful middle finger to its moronic self- importance. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RICKY GERVAIS, COMEDIAN: Apple rolled into the T.V. game with a morning show, a superb drama about the importance of dignity and doing the right thing made by a company that runs sweatshops in China. So when you say your work, but the companies you work for I mean, unbelievable, Apple, Amazon, Disney. If ISIS started a streaming service, you call your agent, wouldn't you? So, if you do win an award tonight, please don't use it as the platform to make a political speech. Most of you spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg. So if you win, right, come up accept your little award, thank your agent, and your God and (BLEEP). (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Hello 911, I'd like to report a massacre at the Beverly Hilton. You know, just then, Hollywood therapists hiked up their prices. It's like being an Uber in a flash snowstorm. He also mocked up desperate desire for wokeness, explaining why he left out the In-Memoriam segment which honors performers who died in the past year. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GERVAIS: We were going to do an In Memoriam this year, but when I saw the list of people that had died, it wasn't diverse enough. They just -- no, it was mostly white people. And I thought, no, not on my watch. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: That was so clever. A few in the crowd got it. Then there was this punch in the face. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GERVAIS: In this room, I saw some of the most important T.V. and film executives in the world, people from every background, but they all have one thing in common. They're all terrified of Ronan Farrow. He's coming for you. He's coming for you. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Look at that guy. Look at his face. It's like he's saying, how dare you bring up our industry's rapists at this fine event. Some of them might even be here. Then there was this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GERVAIS: No one cares about movies anymore. No one goes to the cinema. No one really watches network T.V. Everyone is watching Netflix. You could binge-watch the entire first season of Afterlife instead of watching the show. That's a show about a man who wants to kill himself because his wife dies of cancer and it's still more fun than this. Spoiler alert, season two is on the way. So in the end, he obviously didn't kill himself, just like Jeffrey Epstein. Shut up. I know he's your friend, but I don't care. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Anyway, it was a dream come true for anyone tired of Hollywood telling you how dumb and racist America is, as they continue to take all that money from us dumb racist Americans. And remember, Gervais isn't no righty. He's an old school liberal who believes in freedom of expression, but also freedom from the hypocrisy of the intolerant woke. But you think the world crowd will actually wake up? No, they're too vain, too insecure, and self-unaware to see the truth, even if it came raining down from a beery mouth of a pudgy Brit. So, hats off to you, Ricky who last night didn't really tell a joke, he just exposed the biggest one of all, Hollywood. He's got to do the Oscars, Juan, right, the Oscars. I don't think they have a host. I don't think they have a host. WILLIAMS: Yes, they need him, right? I think Fox needs him. I think he'll do well here. GUTFELD: He could be on ""The Five."" WILLIAMS: No, no, no. Our ratings are good. Ratings for these award shows are terrible. And typically, by the way, you would say award show, Hollywood people, comedians, irrelevant in terms of politics. But now, when Ricky plays from the right, you guys love it. GUTFELD: I -- obviously, I've been saying the same thing for years. WILLIAMS: Right. GUTFELD: But Gervais has been politically like on the left for the longest time. I think this is happening because he's seeing a threat to freedom of speech on his -- among his own party. SMITH: Or the need -- WILLIAMS: You mean comedians? GUTFELD: Comedians. Yes, I think he sees them as you're seeing on campuses, the stifling of free thought. HEGSETH: Because comedians are truth-tellers. And they -- and they tell us things through comedy in ways we can laugh that we otherwise couldn't have polite conversation. I was watching this live because I was watching the football games that's happened to be after, and I realized, OK, he's hosting. And I had to rewind it to believe it. Because you never see something like that. It was amazing to watch. It took courage for me to probably never come back. He said that a couple of times. I'm not coming back. Maybe they will. GUTFELD: If the ratings are good. HEGSETH: If the ratings are great with everybody else that wasn't in that room. And I've said this before, but they would be wise if the Oscars to hire Gutfeld. SMITH: I think -- yes. GUTFELD: No, no, no. SMITH: I think some of the numbers are already out. They're on track for an eight-year viewership low. Although I still think it was up from the numbers compared to the rest of the network T.V. season. But you know, there was a bit of truth-telling but there was also a message to those that were about to take the stage as he was delivering that, Dagen, right and that was don't get political with your speech. That did not happen. If you watch the award show, it was called climate change. It was go out and vote in 2020. We need to change the world. They tackled -- Brad Pitt, maybe not a political message, but a nice one. He urged kindness during his acceptance speech. MCDOWELL: Yes. Brad Pitt's had better work done than anybody in Hollywood. Well, whether it's a dermatologist or whatever. GUTFELD: He is a beautiful man. Beautiful man. I could say that because I'm comfortable in my masculinity knowing that I am better looking than him. MCDOWELL: But he is more beautiful than he was even 20 years ago. GUTFELD: Did you see Once Upon a Time in America -- I mean, in Hollywood? MCDOWELL: Yes. GUTFELD: Best film of the year, right? MCDOWELL: Yes. GUTFELD: I think so. MCDOWELL: But then again, Quentin Tarantino, you know, won the Golden Globe for Best musical comedy. And I thought that the person who wasn't in the room was well, Harvey Weinstein. GUTFELD: Yes. MCDOWELL: He goes on trial today, started today, the sex crimes trial here in New York, slapped with new charges out in Hollywood. So I just want to call out all the people who've benefited from turning their, you know, turning their head away from what he was doing for literally decades. But I'm all -- I don't care what political party you're a member of. I want more people who don't give a flying damn about what Hollywood and these left-wing liberal artists think. I want more Dave Chappelle's. I want more Ricky Gervais. Whether they're at the Golden Globes or on a Netflix special, just bring it on. Bring on the honesty and the laughs. GUTFELD: One thing I noticed today -- MCDOWELL: Greg? GUTFELD: Sorry. I noticed the media, a lot in the media rushing to defend these poor wounded millionaire sex maniacs, I mean, as if you need white knights to defend, you know, these people. They have their therapists, they have their drugs, they have their hookers. Everything will be fine. WILLIAMS: So you think a lot of them? He really like those things. GUTFELD: I'm just jealous, Juan. WILLIAMS: No, it wasn't jealousy. GUTFELD: All right. The ""FASTEST SEVEN"" is up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MCDOWELL: Welcome back. Time for the ""FASTEST SEVEN."" First off, Lori Loughlin reportedly getting ready for life in the slammer by hiring a prison tutor and also training and martial arts. She hasn't even gone to trial yet. Greg, who would you hire? GUTFELD: That's tough. Anybody here at Fox going to jail? Never mind. I love -- I love how she's taking a prep course like it's SAT thing. Something maybe your daughter should have done then she wouldn't be going to jail. What does a prison expert teach you to do? Like how to make, you know, how to turn a sharpie into a shiv, how to make soup into -- out of a Fritos bags. HEGSETH: It says knuckling down, learning the lingo, and practicing martial arts. GUTFELD: Well, I guess that's OK. Like, you know -- HEGSETH: How much martial arts can you really practice to be effective? I can see her approaching someone like this. GUTFELD: Also, how long is she in jail? MCDOWELL: We don't know. She hasn't gone to trial yet. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: I should read -- you know, I should read the notes before I sit down. MCDOWELL: She -- Lori -- here's the quote from the People Magazine article. Lori as a planner and she's doing what she basically do for all contingencies. Sandra, you're a planner. SMITH: Yes, I'm a planner, but I don't know how you plan for prison. But the martial art might come in handy because -- GUTFELD: You should, Sandra, because you're -- I hear what you're doing on weekends. And I'm amazed you're not locked up. SMITH: My defense is always to run. And if I'm behind bars, I can't run I guess. GUTFELD: She runs -- actually, she'll get behind a bar and then to run. WILLIAMS: Martha Stewart did fine, right? GUTFELD: Yes, she was. WILLIAMS: Martha -- but you know -- so I think that a lot of us -- for a lot us, this goes back to the last segment because we're making fun of the Hollywood -- the elite. GUTFELD: Yes. WILLIAMS: But in fact, this is rich people versus -- and people in power versus people who don't have money and don't have power and who get caught up in a prison system and don't have much. GUTFELD: They should have a prison -- these prison experts for everybody like if you got to go to a class before you go to jail. HEGSETH: Well, don't you also get -- you get news in prison. So if I'm a fellow prisoner there and I read that she has gone through a prison training, I'm going to immediately testing that training. SMITH: According to a prison expert, there's etiquette in prison that you have to know about because there's the bunk bed suggestion. So you're not supposed to sit on your bunkmate's bed to like tie your shoes. MCDOWELL: That's a good rule for life. Don't sit on anybody's bottom. GUTWELL: Another good rule is just don't have a bunk bed. SMITH: Indeed. Indeed. GUTWELL: A murphy bed, get a murphy bed nice. HEGSETH: Is that a slide on of the fold down. MCDOWELL: That's the fold down. HEGSETH: Yes, I see. MCDOWELL: Next up, here's your worst flight nightmare caught on video. GUTWELL: Crap. MCDOWELL: The pilot had to return following the detachment after burning off some fuel. No injuries were reported. SMITH: Oh, thank goodness. MCDOWELL: Would you freak out? WILLIAMS: Well, it would concern me. But I will not freak out because you just said, he returned. So I guess he was able to land the plane. It wasn't that he had to like landed on the belly. So, you know, I just was on a flight with a lot of turbulence. And the big news for me was I'm getting all uptight and my granddaughter started laughing. She thought it was a roller coaster ride. GUTFELD: That's what you got. That's how you learn. You know, the flight was operated by jazz aviation. Does that name inspire any confidence in you, jazz? I mean, it's like, we don't maintain our planes, but we do love our Coltrane. SMITH: This was -- this was an Air Canada plane. GUTFELD: Yes. SMITH: Yes. So what always amazes me is that there was a -- there was a - - GUTFELD: My name is jazz aviation. Leaves on a jazz. SMITH: But what always amazes me, Dagan, is that somebody took out their phone and actually took video of this while it was happening, having no fear about what was about to happen to them. WILLIAMS: Wait, they were on another plane or they were -- GUTFELD: They were on that plane. WILLIAMS: How can you take the shot from that plane? SMITH: Looking out the window. GUTFELD: Imagine what we could have -- WILLIAMS: The wheel is under the plane. GUTFELD: -- what was going on before we had phones -- HEGSETH: The wheels were on the wings because it's a smaller aircraft. WILLIAMS: Oh under the wings. HEGSETH: I don't really know but it appears from the video that that's -- SMITH: Sometimes in those situations, the scariest thing is the guy next to us is freaking out and screaming. GUTFELD: That person is called me. MCDOWELL: Yes. The guy next to you with his shoes off with his feet on the spring swiping with a big toe. GUTFELD: That happens. I said I was sorry. MCDOWELL: I hate feet. Trusting your gut is now backed by evidence. Researchers discovered that people who second guess themselves make the worst decisions, Greg. GUTFELD: You just gave me my book title, trusting your gut, right? SMITH: Yes. GUTFELD: Yes. Million seller, you getting nothing. By the way, what was this about? HEGSETH: Second-guessing. You never -- you've ever second guess. GUTFELD: OK. So I read this. This was about -- they were putting predictions on soccer matches. If you want to win a prediction on the soccer match, just write down 0-0 in half. No one scores. SMITH: After learning how deadly sick you were from flu the past week. I second thoughts sitting here. Seriously, I do not get what you have. GUTFELD: I swear you're going to get it. SMITH: Do I live to regret that? GUTFELD: No, no, no. I didn't show up Friday because I didn't want to -- SMITH: Remember you said you're going to talk forward? GUTFELD: Yes, that's true. Well, I am -- WILLIAMS: You shouldn't - you shouldn't second guess yourself, Sandra. SMITH: I did. I did. WILLIAMS: Well, you know the old saying, if you think you stink, right? You might as well go with it. But this is all about game. The idea that you shouldn't be deliberate is wrong. Now, you shouldn't take that from this. SMITH: Just go with your gut. Go with your gut. Trust your gut. MCDOWELL: Go with your Gutfeld. ""ONE MORE THING"" next. GUTFELD: That's another title. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WILLIAMS: It's time now for one more thing. I'm going to go first. You know, while Greg was sick, I ran away. I went to Jamaica. I took a break. So take a look at some of the pictures I brought back. Here's the whole crew dressed and identical tracksuits for the trip, a family tradition. We wear the same outfit when we travel together. That's me with my wife Delise. Of course, the stars of the show my twin granddaughters and grandson. Here's top, top. That's me, given Pepper a piggyback out of the ocean. And here I am with one of the girls looking at a giant beautiful caterpillar. Here's my family at dinner. This was a big deal for us, Christmas dinner. And here are the grandkids and my daughter floating around on the holiday, on all these -- SMITH: That's beautiful. WILLIAMS: Yes. It was an amazing holiday. But let me tell you something. It's great to be back at ""The Five,"" I'm telling you. Greg, you go. GUTFELD: Tell me about it. I've been counting bathroom tiles for the last -- anyway, animals are great. Animals are great. Animals are great. I want -- I'm going to think I'm going to take a jogging because I've gotten fat again, but it's really cold outside. You know, you want to go out and then you go back in. But it's just like this little bunch of critters. They want to go out they want to get some exercise. Everything's great. Then it's like you know what, forget it. I'm going to go back in. I don't need this crap. That was me this morning thinking maybe it might be time to lose my gut instead. I can't do exercise. I'm still sick. I just like watching these -- animals are great. Animals are great. Animals are great. WILLIAMS: You know, normally, animals are great is upbeat. What happened? What happened there? GUTFELD: I don't know, man. I'm on -- I'm on eight different meds. WILLIAMS: All right. All right. I'll buy that. I'll buy that. (CROSSTALK) HEGSETH: Yes, in honor of Jesse who is not here but will be back soon, his Philadelphia Eagles lost on Sunday, but my Minnesota Vikings did not. And we said before the game, if we can get to Drew Brees, we can win this game which we did time and time again. And the other -- the other variable in addition to putting pressure on one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time was would Kirk Cousins show up? And in overtime, he did with this huge connection to Adam Thielen who's back and back healthy. So look out for the Minnesota Vikings because we play the San Francisco 49ers next week in San Francisco. No one gave us a shot against the Saints. GUTFELD: Just watch where you step. HEGSETH: Why? GUTFELD: It's San Francisco. HEGSETH: It's San Francisco. Yes, they're going straight from the airport on the bus. GUTFELD: Well, there's some poop on the field too. WILLIAMS: That's going to be a tough game. HEGSETH: Leave it on the field. WILLIAMS: Sandra. SMITH: All right. So the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas is underway and they're introducing some new technology including a mirror. You know, why you're counting bathroom towels, you look back up at the mirror and you wonder what can I do to fix my skin. Apparently, it's a mirror that lets you know what you can do for your skincare needs, what kind of facial lotion. GUTFELD: Yes. SMITH: Anyway, moving on Charmin Golab. This is the robot, Greg. GUTFELD: What is this? SMITH: You can summon a roll of toilet from your smartphone. GUTFELD: How fitting. SMITH: This device will go and grab it for you and replace it. Although Charmin says it does not have any plans to release a commercial version at this time. So the idea has been put out there. Lastly -- GUTFELD: It should come with a toilet. SMITH: Lastly, the gate box is a voice-powered assistant. So you know, if you don't have the assistant but you want one, you've got the virtual assistant. It projects an avatar so you feel like there's really a person there. So just take note, you know, those are the new gadgets. WILLIAMS: Dagen, bring us home. MCDOWELL: You ever wanted to drive the Wienermobile? Well, here's your shot. Oscar Mayer is accepting applications for 2020 class of Wienermobile drivers, competitive salary, benefits, paid expenses, and free ""team apparel."" GUTFELD: Oh man. MCDOWELL: It's a shot, Greg. GUTFELD: I'd love to get into those buns. WILLIAMS: And clean it up there. Set your DVRs, never miss an episode of ""The Five."" Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC.

115,FOX,"Trump gets backlash for strike that killed Iranian commander; reaction and analysis from 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" January 3, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Dana Perino: Hi there. This is The Five. President Trump speaking about the killing of Iran's top general at an event in Florida. Let's listen back in.  Donald Trump: Thank you, James. Got to know each other well. A friend of mine who was on television before I knew him and he kept saying, you know, he might not know the Bible as well as I do, or frankly, as well as a lot of people. But he's a leader, and he loves God. And he's a great Christian. And he said, “I love him, and I want him to do a terrific job,” and I think hopefully I've more than exceeded expectations. Robert Jeffress. Right? Thank you, Rob. And I hope I have. Cissie Graham Ledge, when you talk about a great family, that's a great family, the granddaughter of Billy Graham and the daughter of Franklin. And I appreciate everything that Franklin has done over the last two weeks. Right? He fought very hard for us. And it's a special woman and it's a special family. Thank you very much. Michael Tate. Everybody knows Michael Tate. Thank you, Michael. Great job. Jensen Franklin. Thank you, Jensen. Great. Alveda King. Jack Graham. Jack Graham. Thank you. Thank you, Jack. And Miami Zone, a man that everybody knows. I think they might know him better than they know me. Is that possible? Yes. Alberto Delgado. Alberto. I especially like to thank Paso Maldonado, Paso Maldonado. What a great guy. What a great guy, what crowds.  [applause]  I think I'm going to come to a Sunday service one of these days, is that all right?  [applause]  We have a lot of fun,. But I want to thank you very much for welcoming us here to El Rey Jesus church, the largest Hispanic congregation in the United States of America.  [applause]  And as you all know from those unemployment numbers, the best in the history of our country. The best. We'll go over that very soon, we're delighted to be with more than 5,000 Christians, including so many extraordinary Hispanic and African American faith leaders who are lifting our nation to incredible new heights. Things are happening like they've never happened before. There is no better place to begin the new year than right here with so many friends and families, pastors and patriots who believe in the power of prayer, the majesty of creation, and the love and grace of Jesus Christ. Thank you.  [applause]  In 2016, Evangelicals, Christians helped us, and they went out. Evangelical Christians went out and they worked so hard and they produced numbers like they've never produced before. And based on what Paul told me, Cissie told me and everybody told me, we're going to blow those numbers away in 2020.  [applause]  Going to blow 'em away. Hi Charlie. Charlie Kirk. Hi, Charlie. He could be a pastor and be a very good pastor.  Every day since I've been fighting for you and we really have -- we've achieved results that nobody thought was possible because things were looking very bleak for a long period of time. Things were looking very bleak. Even a thing like Merry Christmas remains to go around in the summer. I'd say, we're going to say Christmas again. We're going to say Christmas again. And now they're all saying Merry Christmas again. Right? They're all saying, you go to these big department stores, three years ago, four years ago. And that have the snow and that and the red and the white. They'd have everything. But they wouldn't say Christmas. I said, ""Where's Merry Christmas?"" And they said, ""We can't say it."" They're all saying it again. They're saying it proudly.  [applause]  Evangelical --  [end video clip] Dana Perino: You've been listening to President Trump. He's in Miami giving a speech there to a crowd of Evangelical Christians there to listen to him. And he also talked about the news overnight, that the United States took an airstrike, took action against General Soleimani. He was basically the second-in-command there in Iran and he is no more. We're going to take it on the table here at The Five. Now get The Five going. Pete Hegseth is with us, Lawrence Jones, Marie Harf, and Emily Compagno. But, Pete, let me start with you. When you first heard this news, you must have been quite happy.   Pete Hegseth: Yeah, elation. I mean, this is a name that most Americans probably don't know. You know, you know a name like Baghdadi, you know a name like Osama bin Laden. But Soleimani was a name that maybe flew under the radar because you're used to hearing about the Quds Force of the IRGC or the Iranian regime, and not necessarily an individual name. But those who follow the nefarious nature of Iran understand how evil this man is and how are our nation's war fighters have been targeted by him and his forces, not just in Iraq, but around the globe. Hundreds killed and maimed because of him. But it's not just the particular personal nature of the guys in our hospitals here in this country who are recovering from the wounds specifically from him. But it's a strategic way in which he's tried to advance the evil motives of the regime in Tehran. I mean, ultimately the Quds Force, the name of the Quds Force, is the Jerusalem Force. I mean, the Iran -- that's what it stands for in English. Their goal is the capture of Israel and Jerusalem. So, when you look at Iran needs Iraq to get to Syria, to get to Lebanon, to get to Israel. Iraq has always been important to Iran. The ability to meddle there and try to put a Shia Iranian regime in charge has been central to their goals. They propped up Bashar al-Assad. Now, they were putting their top general there to try to connect those dots even further. And President Trump said, if you're going to try to take our embassies, if you're going to try to threaten our people, we've already declared you a terrorist organization, which we did, intentionally, in April of 2019, which no other mission [unintelligible] had done. You pop your head up one more time and your days are limited. And that's precisely what happened. God bless the courage of our president to do it and the war fighters who had the skill to make it happen.  Dana Perino: It was quite skillful. And also, it seems like, Emily, that there was an imminent threat apparent. We don't have the details on this yet, but we hear from the Pentagon that they had some sort of intelligence that there was going to be an attack directed by Soleimani against hundreds of Americans.  Emily Compagno: Right, which is why the Secretary of State has continued to maintain all day that it was a decisive defensive strike, especially with his statements that he has been connecting with world leaders who he says agree with us in that measure. And I agree with everything that you said wholeheartedly. I think for 40 years we've seen U.S. presidents struggle with essentially the question of whether Iran is a country or a cause. And this answers the question of how we're going to proceed. And with those that are saying, ""Well, this is a whole new war."" It's not. It's a new chapter in an ongoing war. And up until now, we have fought it in the realm of economic sanctions and precision strikes with proxies. Now we have erased that line between the proxies and of the country. And I think we've not only delivered a blow to that terrorist regime, but also to the fact that up until now, they've been trying to bully the world into treating them like a country. They're not. And so, therefore, from here on out, as you said, we've -- we will treat them as such.  Dana Perino: They've tried -- you were talking about the strategic way that they were trying to have instability, but it also included India. Anything that the New Delhi attack and I don't know, if in the control room if we still have since we started off here with breaking news, the soundbite from the Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo. I would like to play that because, of course, we have Marie Harf, who works at the State Department here. Let's play that now.  [begin video clip]  Mike Pompeo: President Trump made the decision, a serious decision, which was necessary. There was an imminent attack. The orchestrator of the primary motivator for the attack was Qasem Soleimani. He's got hundreds of American lives, blood on his hands. A military commander who was actively engaged in plotting to kill Americans in the region. The Iranian leadership understands that President Trump will take action. We made very clear that these responses would be swift and decisive. We've now demonstrated that. We don't seek war with Iran, but at the same time, we're not going to stand by and watch the Iranians escalate and continue to put American lives at risk.  [end video clip]  Dana Perino: And Mary, in the last few weeks, we've seen these protests happening in Lebanon and also in Iraq, by citizens who are frustrated. And they were really protesting Iran's influence because they want to be able to govern themselves.  Marie Harf: My question I have today when we're looking at this news is, why now? And we've heard that there was an imminent threat on the horizon. We need to see more information about that, because the Bush administration and the Obama administration both debated taking out Soleimani and they calculated that the risk of doing so and the consequences that would come from that, whether it was basically having us kicked out of Iraq, which the U.S. likely will be now. That's certainly where it's trending. Whether it was a wider regional instability, a wider conflict with Iran, that there's always a calculation that goes into these decisions. Is this strike worth the risks? And to --  [cross talk]  Dana Perino: You talk about the Obama administration, though, wouldn't they have not wanted to strike Soleimani because they were trying to make a deal, a diplomatic deal --  [cross talk]  Marie Harf: There are reasons, there are -- but look, there are reasons the Bush administration also didn't target Soleimani.  Dana Perino: I know but the Bush administration was not trying to make a deal with the Iranians.  Marie Harf: But there are two administrations that had very different policy goals, both of whom separately concluded that to do so would cause wider instability. So, I agree that he was an evil person. There are a lot of evil people in the world. We need to know what the Trump administration's plan is for what comes next. What is -- how are they going to get back to the negotiating table? How are they going to handle possible retribution, which could come in ways we see, and could come in ways we don't, from cyber-attack. It's not funny, Pete. I have friends too over there.   Pete Hegseth: No. Iran is now limping back to the negotiating table because they've realized --  Marie Harf: I will take that bet with you today, Pete. They will not.   Pete Hegseth: So, you know what I can't stand, is the argument today, ""Oh, Iran's going to do something. Oh, no.""  Marie Harf: They are.   Pete Hegseth: ""They mount a counterattack. Oh, no."" You know who needs to look at their back? Iran does. You know who needs to look over their shoulder? The number two general. They need to be the ones worried because it's America who leads.   Marie Harf: Pete.   Pete Hegseth: No, it is honestly they don't have --  Marie Harf: Don't discount the threat to our people in the region. If something happens --  [cross talk]  Pete Hegseth: I understand. If anybody understands the threat to the people in our region, it's me.   Marie Harf: As do I.   Pete Hegseth: We both do.   Marie Harf: We both do.   Pete Hegseth: Why do we play into their narrative by pretending like they're this all powerful --  Marie Harf: We're not playing into their narrative, but ignoring threat is not going to make it go, Pete.   [cross talk]  Dana Perino: But showing that you are tougher, can that be a deterrence?   Lawrence Jones: Yeah, I think it is, and I think anybody that knows me knows that I hate war. I'm not advocating for war.   Dana Perino: Nobody loves war.   Lawrence Jones: And the president, and I'm not a war hawk, but the president said something. I want to quote him. He said, ""We took action to stop a war, not to start a war, and that we weren't advocating for regime change or anything. But the threat was imminent."" And Democrats have told us for months that the president needs to listen to our intelligence agencies. Right? The president listened to our intelligence agencies. And we don't know exactly what was in that briefing. But it was enough that the president felt the need to act. This is a bad guy.   Dana Perino: But I also think that it's kind of hard to compare previous administrations because circumstances are certainly different. As ISIS emerged after the Bush administration, during the Obama administration, now ISIS has declined. And of course, all of us would like to be able to have everyone come home, but only if we can prevent ISIS from resurging.  Pete Hegseth: I think you mentioned risk threshold. There is a different risk threshold here. Because ISIS was allowed to emerge, we ended up partnering with Iran and Soleimani under the Obama administration to try to push them back, which only empowered the Iranian militias more, so they were able to take over Baghdad. Now, they're landing their top general in Baghdad to attack our embassy. Hello. The alarm bells are going off saying our risk threshold has been passed. They're going to attack Americans.  Marie Harf: Soleimani has been doing this for years, Pete. He's been operating in Iraq since the Bush administration. I want to see --  [cross talk]  Marie Harf: -- whatever intelligence. I want to see the intelligence because there's a lot of claims in the administration, and we've seen claims in the past about intelligence. We all need to see --  Dana Perino: Well, there's going to be at full briefings, full briefings, apparently for the congressional members who will be back in town. Well, not in New York. They'll be in D.C. All right. Coming up, more reaction from President Trump on the airstrike taking out Iran's most powerful general. We're going to show that to you next.   [commercial break]  [begin video clip]  Donald Trump: He was plotting attacks against Americans, but now we've ensured that his atrocities have been stopped for good. They are stopped for good. I don't know if you know what was happening, but he was planning a very major attack and we got him.  [end video clip]  Lawrence Jones: That was President Trump moments ago explaining why he took action to kill Iran's top general. He says he did it to prevent a war, but his critics are piling on.  [begin video clip]  Male Speaker: We appear to be without -- by the way, I'd say without congressional authorization -- entering into another Middle East war.  Male Speaker: I would anticipate the Persian Gulf war will begin anew.  Female Speaker: This one-off action can have unbelievably horrific consequences.  Male Speaker: Number one, there will be dead Americans, dead civilian Americans, as a result of this.  Female Speaker: And it's not just service members. All American citizens are now walking prime targets for walking prime targets for Iranian retaliation.  [end video clip]  Lawrence Jones: And some Democrats even accusing Trump of using the airstrike to distract from impeachment. ""Squad"" member Ilhan Omar tweeting, ""So, what if Trump wants war? Knows this leads to war and needs the distraction?"" Oh, my god.  Dana Perino: Good distraction.  Lawrence Jones: Pete, typically when there is something like this the country comes together. You put politics aside. Of course, they can have the debate if the president should declare war. But accusing the president of using this for a block for impeachment?  Pete Hegseth: Oh, but Trump; I mean, the whole idea of him being the commander in chief. There was a commentator today that said, ""Right action, wrong commander in chief."" It ultimately doesn't matter the decision that he made.  Emily Compagno: [laughs]  Pete Hegseth: No, that was literally --  Emily Compagno: Oh, my gosh --  Pete Hegseth: -- Jonathan Alter on another network said that, said -- correct? The implication is ""I'd rather have the correct commander in chief,"" meaning Hillary Clinton, ""and the wrong actions."" And it sums up precisely how everyone who isn't a supporter of this -- the haters of the president view him. It doesn't matter what he does, we're going to dislike him. The reality is, though, the commentary there is true. He made the right call. He made a call based on advisors around him who believe this is an imminent threat, and specifically because he saw a policy action taken under the Obama administration where sovereign American soil where there's a consulate or an embassy was threatened and not taken seriously, dismissed by an Internet video by the national security advisor later on. Ultimately, he said, ""If you're going to try that,"" -- and we know what Iran does. Iran, 40 years ago, used the American Embassy in Tehran as the launching-off point for their Islamic Republic. Embassies are meaningful to them. It's sovereign American soil. He said, ""This will not happen again. And as a result, I'm going -- I see the signs in front of me and I'm going to compensate. I'm going to send the Marines. I'm going to send the 82nd Airborne,"" which he did, by the way, knowing they had intelligence on Soleimani -- that looked like a bit of a bigger reaction than people thought as a result. But they knew what was coming next. So, this was something that as intentional because he didn't -- imagine if he hadn't acted, the amount of negligence he'd be charged with --  Emily Compagno: Exactly.  Marie Harf: No, if he hadn't --  Dana Perino: Yeah.  Pete Hegseth: -- for knowing about the gathering threat and not stepping up.  [crosstalk]  Marie Harf: -- if there really was a different imminent threat. I mean, there have been imminent threats from Soleimani for decades, for over a decade. We know that. That's why I keep harping on actually wanting to hear more about this because I think the American people deserve the knowledge about why this time was different with all of the potential downsides that will come from this strike. Look, I mean --   Pete Hegseth: Like Ghaddafi in 2011, like there are lots of downsides that came from that, too.   Marie Harf: But we're not talking about 2011 Pete we're talking about today and President Trump.   Pete Hegseth: Why can't you to step back and say this is a dead bad guy who's dead and that's a good thing.   Marie Harf: Because I think the consequences that come from it could have far reaching strategic negative impacts in the United States that outweighed the benefit from it. I mean, this is the most consequential decision that an American administration has taken in the Middle East since the decision to invade Iraq in 2003 and I just haven't seen the kind of strategic planning from the Trump administration that it makes me think they know what comes next.  Lawrence Jones: It's one that it's one thing to say, you know, you need more information, but you have Obama, former administration officials like Ben Rhodes saying that they questioned the president's strategy and competence to lead.   Marie Harf: And do to.   Dana Perino: And so that's just that's going to happen, and presidents can't worry about it. Right. They have to be able to make decisions based on the information that they have, the responsibility that they have and the timing and then history will figure that out. Right. That's not for them to worry about right now. The other thing is, if he if there had been an attack based on something that the president knew about and he didn't act in doing it, then what do you think of all the 2020 Democrats would have said instead. That would have been a much different conversation because they would've said how much tougher they would be. So, it's kind of difficult when these things are happening in the middle of a presidential election to the point that Ilhan Omar, the congressman from Michigan, said Minnesota, excuse me that said that maybe President Trump was just trying to create a distraction. I think it could arguably say that from September to now the biggest distraction in America has been impeachment. That was actually a distraction and I also think that there is more strategy behind this because of something you pointed out, Pete, that in April of 2019 the Trump administration designates Soleimani and his group as a terrorist organization. So they've now I think that that probably you will look back and find is the history is written about this time that there was a lot more strategy to it than we thought but it can't you can't plan everything out and so, yes, we need to know anything right now.   Emily Compagno: And I think that the point I'd like to make is the fact that when people say that this is the escalation, what if the Iranians have been doing they have been steadily escalating and become more bolder with their aggressive actions against us right. Starting with oil tankers and then the oil processing facilities and then U.S. positions and then an all-out attack in Kirkuk that killed a U.S. contractor and then an attack on the U.S. embassy. So, I also don't understand why all of a sudden out of the blue, we question the U.S. intelligence community when apparently, especially in domestic matters, they are to be absolutely believed at all points. It's only because of Trump's involvement that all of a sudden, we're not to believe them, we're not to trust them when they have the intelligence community has come out. They strongly indicated that a major attack necessitated preemption with this risk. So why now all of a sudden do we need more information? If--   Female Speaker: Well, we have --  Emily Compagno: --coupled with if coupled with Iranian behavior and decisions in these last year or so has escalated. Why wouldn't we believe that?  Lawrence Jones: We've got to we've got to go. Coming up, 2020 Democrats lashing out at President Trump for killing Iran's top commander. The Trump administration is hitting back. We'll discuss next on The Five.   [commercial break]  Pete Hegseth: Welcome back. Well, 2020 Democrats are blasting President Trump's decision to take out Iran's top general. Candidates claim Trump should have asked Congress for permission first. Yea I'm sure they would have held onto that tidy little secret, and though the airstrike prevented an imminent attack. Take a look.   [begin clip]  Bernie Sanders: Tragically, his actions now put us on the path to another war.   Joe Biden: The risks are greater today because of the actions Donald Trump has taken.   Tulsi Gabbard: This was very clearly an act of war by this president.   Cory Booker: We have a president who has had really a failure in his Iranian policy.   Male Speaker: I can only hope that the president has carefully thought out the national security implications of this attack.   Pete Buttigieg: The next president who will be picking up the pieces after the Trump administration.   [end clip]  Pete Hegseth: There we go and Secretary Mike Pompeo responding with this blistering rebuke.   [begin clip]   Mike Pompeo: We took a very different approach. We didn't send pallets of cash to the Iranians. We didn't pay for hostages. We didn't create a deal which would have given them a clear pathway to a nuclear weapon. We've taken a very different approach. We believe it's the one that will ultimately lead to success and stability in the Middle East.   [end clip]  Pete Hegseth: You know, Dana, is this kind of criticism something you're familiar with is this what political opponents will do when there's a disputed foreign policy or is this even more frothy because of the Trump environment?   Dana Perino: I was trying to I was trying to think back to some other examples of that and I think that the initial obviously the initial response after 9/11 was widely seen, had a lot of bipartisan support. The Iraq war had bipartisan support and then that fell apart pretty quickly after that and then if you think about President Obama's red line then there was criticism about that, although when there were calls for Congress to have a debate.   Pete Hegseth: Yep.   Dana Perino: You see and reauthorize, the Republicans said, we don't want to do that because we think that you're going to head down a path that would tie this president's hands or the future hands of future presidents. I was kind of surprised at Joe Biden today and I think that he could have taken a different tact and separate himself out because the Elizabeth Warren issues like two statements right.   Pete Hegseth: Yea.   Dana Perino: And they were pushing for a more leftward leaning one and I think Joe Biden and in his national position, his position as head of the national polls could have said something like, good, glad that this is taken care of I support the president, United States and we'll take your questions. Right because I think that he could have set himself apart, and I don't think it would have hurt him as much. The extreme positions of somebody like Bernie Sanders or Tulsi Gabbard or frankly, kind of the kind of the weasely one of Mayor Pete.   Pete Hegseth: Yeah.   Dana Perino: Does not inspire confidence.   Pete Hegseth: Marie, though, putting on a political hat a little bit, setting aside the policy because we could disagree about that all day, is that a position Joe Biden could have taken? Can a Democrat nominee really step back and just support Donald Trump in an action he takes overseas? Or is that automatically something you have to hate if you're a Democrat?  Marie Harf: I don't think that Joe Biden supports this action, so I think it would be disingenuous and not genuine for him to say --  Dana Perino: That would be bad.  Marie Harf: -- what Dana wants him to say. And so, I don't think that would be a good thing. I think that Joe Biden is not afraid to use military force. He voted for the war in Iraq, which is not causing the same problems it caused Hillary Clinton in 2008, which is interesting, although Mayor Pete's trying to get that in there.  Pete Hegseth: He's trying?  Marie Harf: He's trying, really -- yeah. But on this. I think that Joe Biden was trying to sort of do a version of that, but say, ""Obviously this is a good thing. Qasem Soleimani was evil. He had American blood on his hands."" But when you're president, you have to think about the second and third and fourth order outcomes. And I don't think that President Trump has. So, he actually was trying to be the moderate here and not, you know, Tulsi Gabbard saying, ""This is an act of war."" I mean, Tulsi's way out there on issues related to Iran. Anyways but, you know, I think that what Democratic voters want to see is a strong statement. And so a statement like Mayor Pete's, which I do think didn't say a whole lot, wasn't -- I think Pete actually having served in Afghanistan could have made a much stronger statement for why he believes this is putting us on the course to conflict. And he missed an opportunity here, I think.  Lawrence Jones: I don't think Joe Biden is the one that we want to go to for these type of decisions. I mean, this is a guy that Robert Gates said has been wrong on every foreign policy decision in the last 30 years. He opposed the Osama bin Laden raid. And so, this is not a guy who would have the guts to do something like this. I'm not sure I would put that mistake in his opinion on this, but I do believe that the other candidates could have struck another tone. But again, the progressive side of the Democratic Party is not going to be for them. They look at this just as war, period. Even though this guy was a bad guy, they see it as war. And someone who is a libertarian like me has even taken a step back saying, ""I want more information."" But this is a counterterrorism strike, and I believe the president did the right thing.  Pete Hegseth: Yeah. I mean, Emily, it shouldn't it be okay to be on Team America for just, like, an hour a day or for a statement?  Emily Compagno: Right. And I think we saw that, interestingly, with Elizabeth Warren today, just like we saw with her with Medicare For All. So, she first of all, said, you know, ""I support this. He was a murderer. I support increased DOD spending for this."" And then basically when the left started freaking out of her party, then she came back and said, ""Oh, just kidding. It was an assassination."" Criticizing Trump's policy. And she suffered for it after she did the same with Medicare For All, support for her deflated. And I think if people see through this. Already, we're seeing a waning for her. But you can't be, as a candidate, all things to all wings of the party, especially that party. And we're seeing it here, for that reason that you can't stand up for one moment and just really tell the truth for one moment.  Dana Perino: I do think that the Bernie Sanders position, though, could be attractive to a lot of people. So, President Trump, for example, when he was campaigning, he was like, we're out, we're done, we're not doing that. And then when you become president, everything looks a little bit different because you have the responsibility and you have more information. But Bernie Sanders today, he was like, I will prevent war with everyone.  Pete Hegseth: Well, we might actually get a chance to talk a little bit more about that, because, of course, President Trump also ran on that. Hey, pull us out of foreign entanglements. That's what Bernie Sanders is talking about it. Maybe we'll talk a little bit about that. Up next, more reaction to the U.S. airstrike that killed Iran's top general on the other side.  [commercial break]  Dana Perino: President Trump declaring his reign of terror is over after ordering an airstrike to take out Iran's top general. Here's the president just a couple of hours ago explaining why he took action.  [begin video clip]  Donald Trump: Soleimani was plotting imminent and sinister attacks on American diplomats and military personnel. But we caught him in the act and terminated him. Under my leadership, America's policy is unambiguous to terrorists who harbor or intend to harm any American. We will find you. We will eliminate you. We will always protect our diplomats, service members, all Americans, and our allies.  [end video clip]  Dana Perino: Speaking of our allies, though, today Secretary Pompeo made specific references to many different countries and allies of ours that he said supported this reaction by asking and acknowledging that it was Iran's escalation that required necessitated our defensive action. What comes next for our allies and us?  Pete Hegseth: No, that's a good thing. I think what comes next, most importantly, where the president will stay focused on is America's interests. That's why one of my favorite things about this was Trump's American flag tweet right afterwards. I mean, it's a reminder that this is an action taken in advance of American interests. We can't rely on Iraqi guards standing outside our embassy. Guess what? We've been training them for 16 years and they still let the Iranians through to trash our embassy. We can't rely on allies who've never been full partners, as much as we'd like them to be, in the war against radical Islamic terrorism. If we're going to defend ourselves, it's going to be us. As it pertains to Iraq and the future. I mean, we killed an Iranian general in Iraq trying to destabilize the country. We've spent that much time, blood, and treasure investing it. I say -- I mean, listen, if the Iraqi parliament votes to say we don't want the Americans there anymore, as far as I'm concerned, fine, fine. And I say hand them all guns and let 'em shoot each other. And I know that sounds sort of, like, barbaric and backwards. But I think there are a lot of people out there in America that say if you're not satisfied yet, if you won't follow through and defend yourself yet, then at what point do we decide it's not in our interest. We can do some from further away and work with allies that are still there, like the Kurds, but pouring money and pouring weapons and pouring investment into places where people don't want it or they're not capable of keeping it, is something this president ran against. So, this action should not pull us closer to war, but instead its weakness invites challenge. This is strength, which I think sends a signal. The right signals we want to run to read right.  Emily Compagno: And all day, also that we -- our messaging has been a commitment to de-escalation there, that if they stop, we'll stop. So, how does, also, all that messaging --  Dana Perino: Well, I think there have been. There's, and there's been frustration along the way, right? There's all of these little points of escalation. The drone that the Iranians shot down.   Pete Hegseth: Shot down, yes. Yeah.  Dana Perino: And talk about the Iranian actions, right? And we have actually kind of, like, kind of let it slide. But you attack the embassy, and then that's different. But also, I think -- and we'll get more information on it -- like, what was the intelligence that led to the strike? And I also think that if the Iraqis decide that they don't want us to be there anymore, the one thing about the American interest piece is that can we be assured that the Iranians won't then use that area to plot and plan against our interests other places?  Pete Hegseth: That's fair.  Dana Perino: And so, we have to be prudent. And I think people should give the president and the administration the space that they need and the time they need to figure that out. But don't forget that Iran is supported by Russia and China. Russia and China just did some joint military drills last week. I mean, keep an eye on this, it's a, it is a bigger play. But I don't think that this was without strategy, I really don't. I think that we will find out that there was something leading up to this for a while.  Marie Harf: If we end up having to leave Iraq because of this, I think there will be many questions about what we actually accomplished during the time we were there. And all of that blood, and sweat, and American men, Pete, that you talked about who sacrifice there, if we end up with no foothold in the country, a government in Baghdad that is closer to Tehran because of us, and a country in Iran where the hardliners feel emboldened and where they now have an external enemy -- because don't forget at home, Iran right now is facing incredible protests domestically, probably bigger than the 2009 protests.  Pete Hegseth: Because of the stand the Trump administration has put on.  Marie Harf: Not entirely, no. There's a bunch of different reasons the protestors are out there in the streets. But one thing we know for certain is that the Iranian regime will use this as a rallying cry back home to solidify their power and it will embolden the hardliners. So, I think it is a strategic question. We know what the positives of taking him out are.  Pete Hegseth: The finger, the finger for that is not pointed at the Trump administration.  Marie Harf: We don't yet know --  Pete Hegseth: The reason why we've --  Marie Harf: -- how the negatives --  Pete Hegseth: -- lost a foothold is not --  Marie Harf: -- how the negatives will play.  Lawrence Jones: Yeah.  Marie Harf: And losing a foothold in Iraq after so many years and so much American money, and blood, and treasure --  Lawrence Jones: I think --  Marie Harf: -- would be a really --  Lawrence Jones: -- I think the main thing --  Marie Harf: -- big problem.  Lawrence Jones: -- I think the main thing to take away now is where do we go from here. And that intelligence is very crucial that they had. And are there still threats that -- we took out the main guy, but there's a number two already that has taken his spot. And so, what are we going to do now? And I do believe that the administration has a strategy and the president has been hesitant to reveal that strategy, I understand for national security reasons as well. But I do believe that America, the country, needs to understand why the president decided to act. And I'm not telling him to divulge all the sensitive information.  Emily Compagno: All right. Okay. We have to go. We are going to switch gears because there's a huge fight brewing in the Democratic Party, and it could have a major impact about who could become the nominee. We'll tell you about it next.  [music playing]  [commercial break]  Marie Harf: Top Democrats trading blows with the Iowa caucuses just one month away. Bernie Sanders going after Joe Biden saying, ""It's just a lot of baggage that Joe takes into a campaign which isn't going to create energy and excitement. He brings into this campaign a record which is so weak that it just cannot create the kind of excitement and energy that is going to be needed to defeat Donald Trump."" And Biden is responding with this jab, ""Good luck, Bernie. Lots of luck in your senior year, Bernie. That's what they used to say in the yearbooks."" In the yearbooks.  [laughter]  Dana, so, a month away from Iowa.  Dana Perino: Yeah.  Marie Harf: I cannot believe we are already there and there is a fight at the top of the polls between a handful of candidates, Bernie and Biden among them.  Dana Perino: Yeah. There's some consolidation, right? And you --  Marie Harf: There is.  Dana Perino: -- finally, you start to see them going after each other. I used to diagram sentences in the eighth grade. We would take the Far Side cartoons and we had to diagram this whole packet. And so, I diagramed a Bernie Sanders one --  [crosstalk]  -- and I don't think that it was very mild. I think if you read into it, he was saying ""a lot baggage."" That equals Hunter Biden and he is trying to, like, let him know that. He said that ""your record is so weak."" That means ""You're not progressive enough and I'm actually the one that can deliver results."" You know, complaints about the Obama administration not going far enough. And then he says, ""You can't create the energy and excitement,"" which basically is saying, ""You're too old and too slow for this, and I'm not."" And I think that it was a little bit tougher jab than weak.  Marie Harf: ""Even though I had a heart attack not that long ago,"" Bernie Sanders. But they -- look, we're going to start seeing more of these jabs at each other because we are down to the wire here in Iowa.  Lawrence Jones: Yeah. And I'm interested to see the Iowa debate on how that's going to go. But look, I think even though it was a petty fight, I think there was a lot of things that were true. Biden does have a lot of baggage. I mean, someone that has been in political office ever since he was 30 has a long track record, and he's flip-flopped on a lot of issues on the campaign to appease the progressive base. Look, I do believe that Bernie is sincere in his belief system; and so, there's a certain authenticity that comes across when he's talking about these issues. But the problem Biden's going to have, not only is that baggage, but that progressive base that probably won't show up in the general election because it seems like the party is -- and I believe Biden is going to be the nominee because there's nobody -- no matter all the hits that he's taken, he's still been the frontrunner.  Marie Harf: Yeah.  Lawrence Jones: A lot of people aren't going to show because they feel like he's been forced down their throat.  Marie Harf: As a supporter of President Trump, which of the Democrats are you most worried about being the nominee?  Pete Hegseth: I still think it's going to Bernie Sanders. I --  Lawrence Jones: And who ?  Marie Harf: Are you worried about him?  Pete Hegseth: -- I'm not worried about him at all. I'm not worried about any of them.  [crosstalk]  But I -- because I think if they think Joe Biden's the guy that's best to beat Trump, look. Look at this response. What does it even mean? This is like --  [laughter]  [crosstalk]  Dana Perino: Do you want me to diagram it?  Pete Hegseth: -- you know, this is really, really bad old people trash talk.  [laughter]  Lawrence Jones: It is.  Pete Hegseth: ""Good luck, Bernie. Lots of luck in your senior year, Bernie. That's what they used to say in the yearbooks. You know, lots of luck in your,"" -- what does that even mean?  [laughter]  Honestly.  [crosstalk]  Dana Perino: That's a sick burn. You don't know that?  Pete Hegseth: What a burn.  [laughter]  This is what he came up on the moment and that just -- so, he's dealing with Bernie Sanders who's a lot of things but not really humorous.  Lawrence Jones: [laughs]  Pete Hegseth: And his attempt -- with Joe Biden -- is to talk about yearbooks? Just like when he talked about old movie reels. I mean, this guy is three steps behind the Democrat candidates. Imagine where Biden would be on a stage where he's having to debate President Trump. It's a joke. So, I --  Marie Harf: He's still polling ahead of President Trump --  Pete Hegseth: -- well, because he's --  Marie Harf: -- in many of the states --  Pete Hegseth: -- polling against --  Marie Harf: -- head to head.  Pete Hegseth: -- ""Weekend at Bernie's,"" too. I mean, he's polling against a terrible --  Female Speaker: [laughs] ""Weekend at Bernie's.""  Pete Hegseth: -- terrible field. And that doesn't say much about his candidacy [spelled phonetically].  [crosstalk]  Marie Harf: Emily, a month out from Iowa. How do you make sense of this?            Emily Compagno: Well, I think that in a different year, a different election, then what Bernie said would be absolutely true, but this, I agree with you, basically. Yes, he has baggage. Yes, he is weak. He's unable to galvanize the population. He has no spark. But this year, it's all about to the Democrats beating Trump, and so far, that has been able to carry Biden nationally for some reason. But as you said interestingly, maybe people are sick of that concept being rammed down their throats because we are seeing him falter in the realm of money and in these early states polling. And I think if he does outperform expectations in Iowa and New Hampshire, obviously he's already strong in South Carolina, that will be a domino effect that will resurrect his fundraising. But for now, if he doesn't, then he might be ultimately gonzo.   Dana Perino: There we go. One month away.   Emily Compagno: The countdown is on.   Pete Hegseth: What seriously is senior year for, Bernie?   Emily Compagno: I don't know. No one knows.  Dana Perino: I don't know what you're talking about, but we need a break.   Emily Compagno: We are all under 85 at this table.   Dana Perino: One more thing on the way.  [commercial break]  Dana Perino: It's time now for one more thing on The Five on this Friday. OK so we love cute animals here. Of course, you know, animals are great and there could be a good reason because it turns out they are actually good natural stress relievers. Michael Philips of The Wall Street Journal wrote a piece today that said a new study by the University of Tulsa is trying to prove that surfing the Internet for baby animal pictures actually makes you more productive at the office, not less. So you can tell your boss that everybody you know, you don't have to meditate and do puzzles. Some of you can just watch a slideshow of cute animals and you will feel better after that. Or you can go to my Instagram page at Dana Perino and see all the pictures of Jasper not a baby anymore, and Lawrence thinks he has the same face, same look on his face every single time.   Lawrence Jones: He does.   Dana Perino: Plus, you Greg Gutfeld you might have seen on Twitter you said he was a little under the weather, but he is feeling better. He's going to be back tomorrow night The Greg Gutfeld Show with Terry Shepherd, Jim Florentine Kat Timpf and Tyrus will be on tomorrow night, 10:00 p.m. eastern with Greg Gutfeld as your host. All right, Pete.   Pete Hegseth: Tea shop might have a few things to say about--   Dana Perino: Maybe so, maybe so.   Pete Hegseth: Yes. Well, if you know, I will be heading home right now to go home to go to sleep because a Fox and Friends weekend we're up from six to ten on Saturday and Sunday morning and for the last two years at the great privilege of hosting with Ed Henry. Now, Ed Henry went and got himself promoted. So, this weekend is his last weekend as the official co-host of Fox and Friends Weekend. He will be starting on January 20 as the co-anchor with Sandra Smith he'll do a fantastic job. You see that trophy there, Ed not only has become a very good friend, but also a nemesis and we've had many, many competitions I'd say we're about equal right now.   Emily Compagno: Are you equal? Is there going to be a competition tomorrow?   Pete Hegseth: I'm going to be generous to my good friend, I will say and Emily's going to be on with us.   Emily Compagno: Is there a competition tomorrow?   Pete Hegseth: We'll make sure to have at least one competition of all competitions.   Dana Perino: Okay we're going to tune in and check that out.   Pete Hegseth: But congratulations to my good buddy, Ed Henry one more weekend.   Dana Perino: Yes congratulations Ed. How about you, Lawrence?   Lawrence Jones: All right. This was a close call, for sure. You got to see this footage and you got to follow the dot. Wild footage shows a beachgoer in Santa Cruz being swept off a coastal cliff by a gigantic wave. Look at that, the dramatic moment was shared on Facebook by the county of Santa Cruz. The footage shows a man tumbling down the rock into a choppy the choppy waters. Thankfully, he was rescued by the state park workers who warned beachgoers waves can sneak up on you. You should never turn your back never on a wave.   Dana Perino: Oh, wow.   Pete Hegseth: You die from that.   Lawrence Jones: [crosstalk] He's OK though.   Female Speaker: Good rescuer.   Emily Compagno: Save that to the end.   Dana Perino: All right Marie.   Marie Harf: OK, so you may have heard of the new challenge called the 2020 tip challenge by now. This waitress from Michigan, Danielle Franzoni was given $2,020 tip while working at Thunder Bay River Restaurant on New Year's Eve. It was a 23$ meal, so that was an 8700 percent tip. She has finally spoken out, thanking the couple for their extreme generosity. Take a listen.   [begin clip]  Danielle Franzoni: I'm going to build a future because of this my kids have a future, and I have a home. It's a big deal. It's a really big deal.   [end clip]  Marie Harf: Wow as we end this first week of 2020. We should have more kind challenges like this, especially in the year that will be fraught with a lot of nasty politics. Yeah, more things like this.   Dana Perino: So, you could keep it going all year.   Marie Harf: Keep it going all year.   Dana Perino: All right. Good idea. Emily.   Emily Compagno: Okay, my one more thing is kind of a mix of Dana and Lawrence's in that it's a dramatic rescue of a puppy. So this 90 pound Pyrenees puppy named Ruby, she fell into a storm drain in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Wednesday and she was trapped 50 feet down. So Tulsa firefighters showed up to dig. They find her trapped all the way down there and they it took them two hours to dig and dig and she finally got her out. She's healthy, she's back with her owner and we obviously extend our gratitude to these brave firefighters. I'm so grateful to them that they always save animals, too. It's not just people.  Dana Perino: It's interesting. Like when animals get freed like that, it's almost like they're like, OK, cool, we're fine. Then they make sure they shake it off so easily. And we're all like we're all like holding our breath, like, is he going to be OK?   Emily Compagno: Although her Ruby's little expression when she was being put to the ambulance was.   Dana Perino: Marie, are you ready to go back to D.C.?   Marie Harf: I am ready to go home.   Dana Perino: We've enjoyed having you on the show this week. We appreciate it. Anyone having a good new year how are your resolutions holding up?   Pete Hegseth: So far, so good.   Dana Perino: Yeah. What was yours?   Pete Hegseth: I keep the bar, nice and low.   Dana Perino: You hesitated there a little.   Pete Hegseth: It's a work in progress.   Dana Perino: All right. Well, it's great to spend our New Year's week with you, and but that is it for us. We're going to be back here on Monday. Have a great weekend, everybody.

116,FOX,"Bernie Sanders raises $34.5 million; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from "" The Five,"" January 2, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Dana Perino: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino, along with Emily Compagno, Marie Harf, Lawrence Jones, and Tom Shillue, it's 5 o'clock in New York City. This is The Five.  [music playing]  Dana Perino: Tension is growing between the U.S. And Iran after Iranian-backed militants tried to storm the American embassy in Baghdad. The attack ending when the militia left the scene after just two days. The Trump administration responding by sending hundreds of troops to the area, but media coverage of what happened is getting major backlash. Some outlets slamming the president and even trying to label the incident as Trump's Benghazi. Here's a look at some of the coverage.  [begin video clip]  Male Reporter: You've got them, Steve, stoking anti-Americanism, potentially giving an advantage to Iran.  Female Reporter: This goes back to really strategic decision that the president made.  Female Reporter: We're engaged in a war of words, which is certainly not helpful.  Male Reporter: These are tough times and one worries whether the administration has the sort of horsepower and brainpower to deal with them.  [end video clip]  Dana Perino: And MSNBC's Joy Reid piling on with this tweet, calling the embassy attack, ""Trump's Benghazi."" And other outlets like The Washington Post under fire for label labeling the Iranian-backed militants as just protesters. The New York Times is also facing similar criticism for describing the attackers as mourners. A former Benghazi team member is blasting the Benghazi comparisons.  [begin video clip]  John Tiegan: It's not really similar at all. It wasn't another Benghazi. It's not Trump's Benghazi. To me, it wasn't even close to Benghazi. I kind of laughed when some said, ""Oh this is Trump's Benghazi."" No, it's not, because all -- again, all the non-essential personnel were evacuated. There's no ambassador there to be killed like they'd left the ambassador in Benghazi.  [end video clip]  Dana Perino: Lawrence, there wouldn't be comparisons to Benghazi if there wasn't a Benghazi.  Lawrence Jones: Right.  Dana Perino: Really -- it really is not comparable.  Lawrence Jones: At all. And Tig said it well. But Tanto also says there is a difference between a riot -- he was also there -- and a coordinated attack. And the response was also different. There were no lives lost. The fact is that President Trump immediately, and the Defense Department, the Secretary of State, all stepped in to make sure that there were people there, marines are already there, people are being shifted, and nobody died. I just think this shows you how far the media is willing to go to give cover to Democrats. And you think when it comes to national security, foreign policy, although we may have some differences when it comes to attack, we should be unified on it. And the fact that they are carrying the water, the Democratic Party, is pretty shady.  Dana Perino: Marie, you know, probably, more about this attack than anybody here. So, how do you -- what do you think about attempts to compare this? I mean, one of the things that happened in Benghazi was the video maker got arrested and basically, they did a perp walk of him saying that the video sparked the attack when that -- we of course, we know that wasn't true.  Marie Harf: They're very different situations. The compound in Baghdad is incredibly well-fortified. It's very well-protected. Obviously, the Benghazi outpost was in the front lines of an ongoing civil war. An actual better comparison to Benghazi, I think it was the attack in Niger, early in the Trump administration where four American service members were killed in a very botched operation. I don't think the comparison is good here. Some of the people we played, though, in those clips weren't talking about Benghazi. They were talking about what President Trump's strategy is vis-a-vis Iran and whether he has one, quite frankly. And I think my concerns here aren't about some Benghazi comparison. It's about the fact that much of what the Trump administration has done has emboldened the hardliners in Iran. The IRGC today feels like they can encourage their militias in places like Iraq and Syria to do this. And we have to figure out how we're going to respond. You know, the Israelis have taken a lot of kinetic action against Shiite militias backed by Iran in places like Iraq and Syria. But they do it much more quietly because they're trying to send a message, but not provoke some of the outrage that you've seen on the ground, which unfortunately can put our people in harm's way. Thankfully, we've evacuated the embassy, but a result of that is that we don't have people on the ground doing American diplomacy --  [cross talk]  Emily Compagno: We have Marines that are there to help protect them --  Marie Harf: For security reasons.  Emily Compagno: -- But one of the reasons that Iran has been able to train up all of these other militias is because they've got a lot of money during the Obama administration --  Tom Shillue: Pallets full of it.  Emily Compagno: -- The JCPOA  Tom Shillue: But what difference, at this point, does it make?  Dana Perino: Callback, that's callback right there.  Tom Shillue: The thing is that I want to shame the media on this because, you know, those headlines from outlets like The Washington Post, New York Times, they have to differentiate between -- there are protests in Iraq, since October. Real protests. And I -- this what you see on social media, you see people on Twitter saying, I'm one of the real protesters. I've been protesting this government because they are very angry in Iraq about -- they want reforms. Yes. And so, Iranians have come in and piggybacked on those protests. And the media needs to differentiate, and they're not doing their job and saying that they're very different --  Dana Perino: The administration has done that. We also have some sound here from President Trump. [laughs] I was like -- I'm like, Emily?  Emily Compagno: I know. I looked up and I was like, I got to remember your name because, you know, I don't even know what day of the week it is, actually. If you've been working this during the holidays and you're like me, you're like, is it Friday? Is it Monday? I haven't really no idea. And take a listen to President Trump, who -- he obviously knows what day is.  [begin video clip]  Donald Trump: The Marines came in. We had some great warriors come in and do a fantastic job, and they were there instantaneously, as soon as we heard. I used the word immediately. They came immediately and it's in great shape. As you know, this will not be a Benghazi. Benghazi should never have happened. This will never, ever be in Benghazi.  [end video clip]  Marie Harf: Look, it's not a comparable comparison for it on any level. We have made drastic efforts not to provoke Iranian- backed militias as we've been fighting ISIS this entire time. And the bottom line is that their continued aggression against bases could not be tolerated. So, I agree with you that there's a bit of nebulous-ness in strategy in the past couple years. But the bottom line is we've taken that hardline stance with a very articulable position that will serve us well in the long-term. And I think that, you know, the Iraqi government, obviously, they're in a difficult position. But regardless, they need to take a stance. They need to protect our embassy. And you know, to your point about the media, you know, their headline today -- not to jump issues, but about the Uyghur murder right now in China. They said as it detains parents, China weans children from Islam. So, we are no stranger, they are no stranger to the fact that all of their headlines are absolutely ludicrous in these times of -- what we deserve would be political specificity. And final point, my friend actually headed out to Baghdad today on behalf of the U.S. government. He said as he was checking in -- he flew commercial. And the woman who checked him in at the airline counter was like, Baghdad, like, are you aware of what's going on right now? And he goes, ""More than the average bear."".  Dana Perino: Yeah, I think he was pretty well aware.  Lawrence Jones: The New York Times also referred to these terrorists, protesters, whatever you want to call them, as mourners. What were they mourning? The fact that they got attacked?  Dana Perino: Yes.  Emily Compagno: Yes.  Lawrence Jones: “Well, I was attacked.” You're mourning that?  Dana Perino: I mean, yes, they were --  [cross talk]  Marie Harf: But I mean, to Tom's point, I think it was a really smart point, that the people on the ground who are protesting, who are outside our embassy are a bunch of different people. Some are mourners, some are protesters --  [cross talk]  Lawrence Jones: -- is being killed, right?  [cross talk]  Marie Harf: Yes, they are. They're their bad guys. The Iraqis, as as Emily said, are in a tough position because they want this place to be safe. They want our embassy to be safe. They also see these airstrikes, at some level, as an imposition on their sovereignty. And so, they're trying to play this game where they're trying not to allow, you know, people to come on to their airspace and to do these things. But they also don't like these Iranian-backed militias. They're trying to play this middle space here. And that's really hard for the Iraqis, a government we want to be strong going forward.  Dana Perino: I think that comparisons to Benghazi that early, that the types of comparisons that we saw, that like, jumped the gun makes me think that they never really understood what happened in Benghazi in the first place. There's a great movie about that called 13 Hours. Catch it over the weekend because it's only Thursday. All right. President Trump getting a big boost for 2020 while Democrats continue to take aim at each other. We're going to tell you about it next.  [commercial break]  Lawrence Jones: Yeah, country. Things just got a lot harder for Democrats trying to stop Trump in 2020. The president's campaign with a massive cash haul, raising almost $50 million in the last quarter. It also has over $100 million on hand. The Trump campaign crediting the Democrats impeachment push for the huge numbers. On the other side of the aisle, Bernie Sanders is surging. The socialist raised over $34 million while Joe Biden struggles to keep up. This all happening while Democrat in-fighting intensifies. Andrew Yang going after Biden for saying, ""Coal miners should learn to code."" Take a look.  [begin video clip]  Andrew Yang: And let them do the kind of work that they actually want to do, instead of saying to a group of people that you all need to become coders.  [applause]  Like, what is that about? You know, maybe Americans don't all want to learn to code.  [end video clip]  Lawrence Jones: Wow.  Dana Perino: But everybody will be given $1,000.  Lawrence Jones: Is this --  Dana Perino: I'm here for it.  Lawrence Jones: -- right. But --  Dana Perino: [laughs]  Lawrence Jones: -- Yang puts, goes to a larger point, though, right?  Dana Perino: He does.  Lawrence Jones: Does it seem like -- is Joe Biden out of touch?  Dana Perino: Well, you know, he raised 22 points [spelled phonetically] and a million dollars which, as I understand, was a little bit higher than the expected. But still, when you look at Bernie Sanders, $35 million.  Lawrence Jones: [affirmative]  Dana Perino: This guy had a heart attack two months ago.  Lawrence Jones: Yeah.  Female Speaker: Literally.  Dana Perino: He got the AOC endorsement, and that seemed to give him a lot of momentum.  Lawrence Jones: [affirmative]  Dana Perino: It was funny that he said, or I saw a breakdown earlier, he said, his campaign, that a lot of campaign contributions came from employees of Amazon, which is so funny because, apparently, internally at the campaign, at the Bernie Sanders campaign, like, how do we spend $35 million? And they get mad if anybody orders office supplies from Amazon because Amazon is like this evil corporate giant. I think the thing is President Trump will have an advantage over Democrats no matter what. He's the incumbent.  Lawrence Jones: Right.  Dana Perino: He's going to have so much money, and they're divided. But you know, that could all change a month from tomorrow.  Lawrence Jones: Right.  Dana Perino: When you start to see if the, if the field can coalesce around a certain candidate. But right now, I would say -- if I were the Democrats, I'd be kind of worried.  Lawrence Jones: Marie, Biden is still leading in the polls, but you have Mayor Pete raising $24.7 million?  Marie Harf: Yeah.  Lawrence Jones: Is that -- should Democrats be concerned about Mayor Pete surging right now?  Marie Harf: No. I think what's interesting is that we all learned the lesson in 2016 that having the most money doesn't make you a winner. Hillary Clinton had a lot more money than Donald Trump. It's about a lot of different things. So, money doesn't equal victory, right? Joe Biden is competitive with these numbers. What's interesting, a couple of points. First, Elizabeth Warren, really tanking. I mean, she had a surge. She was going up and up in the polls and she has just flatlined.  Lawrence Jones: Why do you think she's tanking?  Marie Harf: I don't know. It's a good question. I think that she maybe thought she could steal some of the Bernie folks. But the resurgence of Bernie Sanders, as Dana said, he had a heart attack, a literal heart attack on the campaign trail. But if you look at how much Democrats are willing to invest in this cycle, if you add up all of these numbers, whoever the nominee is, is going to be very well funded. Democrats are focused. They're willing to spend, not just for the presidential, for the Senate races, for the House. They're very invested in this cycle overall.  Lawrence Jones: Emily, it seems like the impeachment push is backfiring on Democrats because the Trump campaign is still raising money, $100 million on hand, $50 million that they were able to raise. Is that a problem for them?  Emily Compagno: I think so, absolutely. A predictable one because, as there has been that civil war in the Democratic Party of how to approach impeachment and how to approach Trump, all that did was galvanize the other side of the equation who are rallying in support, clearly, as the donations indicate. I think it's also interesting that -- okay. So, we just got our quarter four numbers. In quarter one, two of the three highest fundraising Democratic candidates are no longer in the race --  Marie Harf: Yeah.  Emily Compagno: -- which is really interesting. And I'd like to make a point about the Julián Castro dropping out. Every run is obviously a vanity project, but his, like, off the charts, way more so. And this is not the last we've heard from him, obviously. And I think that the New York Times in 2014 said it best, which is basically that ever since he was the first Latino to give the keynote speaking address at the DNC convention that he and his twin brother have been seeking ways to stay on the national stage, to stay on the national radar, and they will continue to do so.  Lawrence Jones: How do you think impeachment is going for the Democrats, Tom?  Tom Shillue: Well, obviously, the president's fundraising like crazy. And Democrats are admitting that now. They're saying, ""Oh. Obviously, the president's been able to fundraise off that."" And so, it's been very effective for him for, you know, as far as money goes. He's also getting tons of small donors. I don't know the numbers on the Democrats, though, because that's what I want to see. Who's getting the small donors? I'm assuming it's Bernie.  Marie Harf: Bernie.  Emily Compagno: Bernie.  Tom Shillue: Yeah, it's Bernie. The richies --  Female Speaker: And Pete, I think.  Tom Shillue: -- love Pete, though. I mean, maybe he gets some small donors. But just from my experience, when I'm driving around the people with those big mansions, they've got a Mayor Pete thing sticking out of their lawn. Rich people love that guy. I don't know why, but they do.  Lawrence Jones: Dana.  Dana Perino: Do you think it's partly generational with Pete?  Lawrence Jones: Maybe.  Female Speaker: Yeah.  Lawrence Jones: I do think he's a lot more relatable to a lot of younger people. But I also think he's too polished and he doesn't come off as very authentic. It seems like they poll every single thing that he says.  Marie Harf: Young people love Bernie, too, though.  Dana Perino: That's what I was --  Lawrence Jones: Yeah, they do. They do.  Marie Harf: It doesn't make any sense to me.  Lawrence Jones: They do love Bernie. But I believe that you have someone that's closer to their age --  Marie Harf: Yeah.  Lawrence Jones: -- that's more relatable than Bernie.  Marie Harf: And I think a lot of Democrats are looking and searching for the next Obama.  Lawrence Jones: Yeah.  Marie Harf: And they think Pete may be the closest.  Lawrence Jones: And I don't think --  Marie Harf: To be clear, there is no next Obama.  Lawrence Jones: -- there's not.  Marie Harf: There will never be one. We've got to find something else --  Emily Compagno: There's a lot of --  Marie Harf: -- and that's okay.  Emily Compagno: -- Never Trumper Republicans that like Pete, however. And I don't know about the generational thing, but I see a lot of signs for him in Seattle. Like, I think he is actually kind of -- has a wider spectrum of appeal to people --  Tom Shillue: Seattle, land of Never Trumper Republicans.  [crosstalk]  Lawrence Jones: Dana, I want to get you to weigh on -- because the Democrats, they're eventually going to have to pivot from impeachment. So, from a communications standpoint, how can they pivot from this?  Dana Perino: Well, the -- well, the candidates themselves are not talking about impeachment. But they're basically being asked to run a marathon with 20-pound weights around their ankles, and that -- the weights are the impeachment. And now, it's advantaged Republicans, and even Mitch McConnell is besting Pelosi, for now. We'll see if that changes; but from a communications standpoint, it looks like a real loser.  Lawrence Jones: I think they have to blame the progressive wing of the party. I think Nancy Pelosi, the strategy, she did not want to do this. I think that she was kind of pushed by the AOCs of the world and that progressive caucus. And even the Maxine Waters of the world.  Marie Harf: It was the moderates who put her over the top, though, because it was about national security. It was those moderate members that were the ones that said, ""We don't want to do this either, politically, but we think we have to.""  Lawrence Jones: Yeah.  Marie Harf: That's what's so interesting.  Lawrence Jones: All right. We've got to leave it there. A New Year's Eve food fight erupts between liberal Mayor Bill de Blasio and Domino's Pizza. We'll tell you all about it next on The Five.  [music playing]  [commercial break]  Emily Compagno: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio celebrating the New Year by blasting Domino's Pizza. It comes after a store sold 30 dollar pies to New Year's Eve revelers in Times Square. De Blasio tweeting, “Jacking up your prices on people trying to celebrate the holidays, classy Domino's.” He also claims the chain exploited customers and suggests visiting other local pizzeria. A large Domino's pie usually goes for around 15 dollars and the pizza chain is now firing back, saying those locally owned stores provide jobs to thousands of his constituents. Now, first of all, I think this is indefensible, especially because everyone knows, apparently, except for the mayor, that, yes, these represent franchise franchises they are all locally owned, they're all local employees, and also, maybe he hasn't gone to Times Square during a ball drop, but it is so packed and that's economics when you're dealing with to a time when you're dealing with delivering food to a ton of people in a confined space in a constrained amount of time that's called supply and demand. What say you Lawrence?   Lawrence Jones: First of all, who eats Domino's in New York City I think that's a problem itself.   Female Speaker: A lot of people do.   Lawrence Jones: Well hey, to each his own, that's not quality pizza. But from a poor --  Marie Harf: I agree it's not.   Lawrence Jones: It's not. Thank you, Marie.   Marie Harf: Yeah.   Lawrence Jones: But the larger point here is Bill de Blasio dude you've been raising our taxes like constantly. So, I don't understand how he can have such hypocrisy I'll take a 30 dollar pizza over 50 percent in taxes every you know so that's just me. Emily Compagno: Exactly Marie how do you feel about it?  Marie Harf: I get mad whenever I try and get an Uber and its surge pricing for some reason and it's more expensive and I'm like, why are they charging me more for this, but I understand it's supply and demand. We don't have to hate everything de Blasio does.   Emily Compagno: I think it's--   Marie Harf: I think we just love to hate him.   Lawrence Jones: I just think it's hypocritical.   Marie Harf: No, he -- everything he does is hateable though.   Emily Compagno: I think it's idiotic. It's totally idiotic.   Marie Harf: Yes.   Emily Compagno: First of all, you know, the people that thought it was worth 30 dollars are the people who bought it.   Lawrence Jones: Bingo.   Emily Compagno: Like if you're sitting there like a so if, like if you--   Tom Shillue: They loved it.   Female Speaker: It's like, what is the method--   Female Speaker: Did they, though, love it?   Female Speaker: Yes Enid Zanwar [spelled phonetically] of New Jersey said it's absolutely worth it. It was hot. It seems like it just came out of the oven. If he comes back, I will buy some more. Everyone, was loving it.   Emily Compagno: He runs a city that's like the beating heart of financial and--   Lawrence Jones: Literally.   Marie Harf: The world and like and he doesn't understand capitalism. I mean, I don't mean I don't I don't I'm usually not that mean but honestly, that was really dumb.   Emily Compagno: It's not mean. You're accurate. What do you think Tom?  Tom Shillue: Dominos going to have to send a couple of free pizzas to that dumb Brooklyn gym he's always carting himself off to.   Emily Compagno: See that would be funny.   Lawrence Jones: Yes.   Dana Perino: I wonder if he has to pay when to get in there.   Emily Compagno: That would be funny.   Tom Shillue: I'm sure but the Dominos isn't that bad. I mean, you know--   Lawrence Jones: It's terrible.   Tom Shillue: Everyone has this attitude about New York pizza, you know, who has good pizza Boston. I grew up in Boston and we had great slices, little thin slices of pizza on Boylston Street. Then I come to New York and they all said it ay New York pizza you've got a full [unintelligible] New York pizza stinks compared to Boston.   Lawrence Jones: You know how you're wrong when you get me and Marie to agree and look at you crazy you're wrong.   Tom Shillue: Have you ever had pizza in Boston?   Lawrence Jones: I have, and it's terrible. I travel all across the country and I always get the food.   Emily Compagno: Chicago's pretty good.   Lawrence Jones: Chicago is very good.   Emily Compagno: Chicago style pizza I agree.   Tom Shillue: You all have attitudes.   Emily Compagno: You know how much hate Twitter you're going to get because you just said New York pizza wasn't good.   Tom Shillue: You know what?  Female Speaker: No, how much love he's going to get from Boston.   Tom Shillue: Go to little Stevie's house of pizza on Boylston Street and tell me that that is not better New York style pizza than New York.   Emily Compagno: Chicago style deep dish pizza.   Marie Harf: Delicious.   Emily Compagno: Zachary's in the Bay Area.   Marie Harf: This other thing is like when has de Blasio complained about big developers gouging.   Lawrence Jones: No, they don't that's why--   Marie Harf: Has that ever happened no, because they are his supporters.   Lawrence Jones: Yeah and they write big checks to his campaign. Look, look that's the thing I'm not upset at him for the comment I'm upset that he's so hypocritical about it and to pretend like he's for the people. Meanwhile, we're struggling having to pay all this money in taxes and meanwhile, all my friends that just came here from Texas to visit, they realize the surge pricing when it comes to New York. It does it's not because it's quality, because it's New York can you can do it.   Female Speaker: I'm starving now also.   Emily Compagno: The issue for me is that the ignorance you know and also at midnight, by the way, while he was tweeting that out or having an issue with Domino's, he ceded veto power on the fifty one point five billion dollar plan for the MTA here in the city because he wouldn't represent the city himself and he wanted he wanted somebody from the finance department to do it. So basically, because he got into a spat with the governor, he ceded veto power for this whole plan. So I think, you know, you talked about like we don't have to hate everything that he does, but literally everything he does is so hateable and so misguided and so ignorant.   Female Speaker: He was a wife who had that lovely dance at midnight.   Female Speaker: Oh, God, I don't care save it.   Female Speaker: [crosstalk] Have you ever gone to a football or a baseball game or even go to the Rangers game here like how much do you think they charge you for a piece of pizza there?   Lawrence Jones: I know.   Dana Perino: A piece of pizza not a whole pie.   Lawrence Jones: Happens everywhere.   Emily Compagno: Well, see with Domino's it added up actually to thirty two dollars if you go by the slice, which is over what they were selling and that franchise has been delivering pizza in Times Square for 15 years over new years. Like clearly, something is working.   Dana Perino: I'm glad that Dominos pushed back.   Lawrence Jones: Yeah.   Dana Perino: Right like just punch him right back in the nose.   Emily Compagno: They should send a whole bunch of pizzas to City Hall. I think that would be funny.   Marie Harf: I wouldn't send them free pizzas.   Lawrence Jones: I wouldn't give them nothing.   Marie Harf: It would be funny. Yeah ok. Try to be the bigger person.   Emily Compagno: Ok, all right.   Marie Harf: My New Year's resolution failing.   Emily Compagno: Massive lines for legal pot and other controversial new laws popping up in liberal states that's next.   [commercial break]  Marie Harf: It's a new year and some new laws and blue states across the country are causing controversy. Like in Illinois, where thousands of people lined up in Chicago to buy marijuana on New Year's Day. Even the state's lieutenant governor showed up to get some pot. People there are very excited about it.  [begin video clip]  Female Speaker: Honestly, better than Christmas when I got my Barbie dream house. [laughter]  Male Speaker: They let me buy the whole [bleep]. Some edibles, some weird kind of wax crumbles, some dabs.  Male Speaker: Just like the feeling, you know. I just like being high, I guess. [laughs]  [end video clip]  Marie Harf: Illinois is now the 11th state where pot is legal. So, polling in the country routinely over the past few years has gone up enough in terms of people supporting legalization of marijuana. And in some polls in the past few months, for the first time, a majority of Republicans also support it. So, this is one of those issues that I feel like it's trending in that direction. Lawrence, what do you make of this?  Lawrence Jones: I've always supported it. Actually, not true. Five years I've turned over a new leaf on it because I've --  Marie Harf: So, to speak, a new leaf. [laughs]  Lawrence Jones: Exactly. Nice play on words. I think that there is a lot of misinformation that goes out there, and especially when you're talking about administration that wants to combat the opiate crisis. Marijuana is the best tool to do that. There's also this thing that I hate being said, that it's a gateway drug. That has also been disproven. And I also think that it's terrible that we have so many people locked up over pot when alcohol does more damage to the body than marijuana. So, I celebrate.  Marie Harf: There you go. Something else we agree on. Dana, one of the conversations that surrounded the legalization of marijuana issues has been about veterans and PTSD and how -- I mean, you mentioned opioids, Lawrence -- but how marijuana can actually help people who are suffering from chronic pain or people, like veterans, who have real problems and they don't just want to turn to pills.  Dana Perino: Like, I'm for states being able to make their own decisions, right? And have these have elections that go into place -- in the direction that people want to go, except that the federal government hasn't kept pace with that. And we'll see. Policy-wise, I mean, they're way behind, and so it gets a little bit confusing. I also am just not woke enough to be up for this. [laughter] I'm just not. And I worry that this could be an experiment that goes bad in the long run. I'm for the veterans, and I know that there's a lot of benefits, especially for some veterans. But for, like, the young woman that's lining up there at 8:00, she can't wait. If she would've took a shot of whiskey at 8:00 o'clock in the morning before she went to work, would we all think that was cool?  Marie Harf: You don't do that? [laughs]  Lawrence Jones: No.  Marie Harf: Kidding. I think you're woke, by the way, Dana. Emily, you live in Washington, a state that is very progressive when it comes to marijuana. So, -- you've you know, you have people in your community, you have these stores where you can buy in your community. What do you make of it?  Emily Compagno: Yeah. And I grew up in California. I think that we need to be specific for viewers. So, first of all, Illinois is the 11th state to legalize it, recreational. We have -- it's the 30th states, or is among 30 states that have legalized it for medicinal purposes, which kind of dovetails into your question to Dana. I agree with Dana. And, I think, moving forward, you can say that this is a win for citizens, sure, and that it's reflecting a trend that polling has indicated. That being said, a) the federal government has not caught up so, frankly, we are all still confused, and legislatively we are still confused. And secondly, remember where this is coming from. It's all about the government see a dollar that you have is a dollar of lost income to them, to them. So, this is all about the amount that the share that they can recoup each state. That's also why, for example, out-of-state residents there in Illinois, what they are able to purchase is like half the quantity that in-state residents can. So, there's just a lot of, I think, additional things that stem from this that it helps to be knowledgeable about. And to your point about the information, I think we place a lot of stock in things like FDA approval and the federal government's attachment to things, where there's a whole host of other sources that are probably far more cutting edge and reliable that would help to educate citizens so they had less fear and worry about it becoming legalized.  Marie Harf: Tom, on day one in Illinois, nearly 3.2 million dollars of pot products were sold, to Emily's point about the dollars behind this. This is big business in many of these states.  Tom Shillue: Yeah, and they want the tax revenue, but I think we're very goofy about it. Like, we can't -- we don't have perspective. We just had a federal ban on the vaping products. Cigarettes are now almost illegal. They seem to be in many states now, they're more illegal than pot because --  Dana Perino: They're more expensive than a Domino's Pizza on New Year's Eve.  Tom Shillue: Yes. And they're --  Marie Harf: Way to bring it back.  Tom Shillue: You can't smoke -- I mean, you know, in my co-op, there's a guy who smokes. He has to leave the property and go, you know, down the street to smoke, and you can't smoke in front of it. So, we're making all these restrictions on tobacco and now we're embracing pot like it's this kind of magical thing. It's going to cause problems. And then people can say, oh, big pot. They're going to treat it just like big tobacco. And they're going to be complaining about that. That's what the people who are against these laws say, this is just like big tobacco. And it probably will be. Just give it some time.  Marie Harf: Another interesting law here in New York state that went into effect on January 1st. Judges in New York no longer be setting money bail for most misdemeanors and nonviolent offenses, including many drug offenses of the kind we were just talking about. Under the new law, thousands of people currently in jail awaiting trial on bail will be released. You know, Emily, there's been a big debate in this country about whether cash bail is fair or not. You shouldn't be able to get yourself out on bail only if you're rich. Right? Our criminal justice system is supposed to treat everyone equally. What do you make of this new law?  Emily Compagno: I think it is an example of a poor solution to a definable problem. And I believe in this state in particular, it's a horrible solution. Here's why. The two issues in this state in particular are, one, that it removed judges' discretion to make that call, whether that person is injurious or potentially -- basically for public safety, that they can take that away. And secondly, it's the classification system of violent felonies. So, everyone accepts this aid, oh, well but it doesn't apply to violent felonies. Well, guess what's not a violent felony? A sex crime against a child. A home invasion burglary. Stalking. A lot of other things that are pretty violent to me. So, I think this particular law is absolutely poorly executed. And even before January 1st, we had 25,000 defendants released because the judges were like, well, it's coming around the corner. So, might as well.  Marie Harf: Might as well. Lawrence, this is a problem that a lot of people are wrestling with. Shouldn't be able to get out on bail if you're rich and not if you're poor.  Lawrence Jones: I do believe there is injustice. I've been fighting for criminal justice ever since I've worked in a juvenile court and I realized that the disparities existed. But I also agree with Emily that judges should have some discretion. I worked with a lot of judges before and they would say, you know what, I can't do it because the law requires me to do this. And when it comes to bills, it is true that a lot of poor people can't afford it. But I also believe that people should only be in prison if their a risk to society. And so, this has become a money-making business, just like when we were just talking about marijuana a while ago. Part of the reason why this hasn't been repealed and people can just buy it is because of the pharmaceutical companies, and that they give so much money to politicians and stuff. And so, we've got to take money out of this stuff. We also have to take money out of the criminal justice system. When it comes to civil asset forfeiture when you have --  Dana Perino: Yeah.  Lawrence Jones: -- people that continue to want asset forfeiture because it funds police departments. That's not justice, that's you serving your own interests. And the criminal justice system was not designed to serve government, it was to protect us all.  Marie Harf: Dana, what do you think?  Dana Perino: Well, I'm -- Emily and Lawrence know a lot more about this than I do. I just basically pay my taxes and I hope the government is going to protect me. And I'm sort of new to criminal justice reform, and I think one of the things that I would look at is can any of this funding go to preventing recidivism, right? So that you get people to get broken out of the cycle of going back to jail over and over again.  Marie Harf: Yeah. Last word, Tom.  Tom Shillue: Well, I'll just speed it up. I would do a trade. If you're going to, if you're going to cut bail and there's going to be more defendants who are out awaiting their trial, then cut the time to the trial. It's like get them into the court system. So, don't let them out and then six months, a year goes by. I would make a deal. I'll only -- I'll make a bail deal with you, but you've got to get them into the trial faster.  Marie Harf: Get the concept of speedy into the criminal justice system like it's supposed to be.  [crosstalk]  Okay. Don't go anywhere. The Fastest 7 is up next. Stay tuned.  [music playing]  [commercial break]  Tom Shillue: And now, time for the Fastest 7.  [laughter]  First up: We all know the panic caused when you forget to silence your phone, like in the middle of a movie or when you're out to dinner. Watch the hilarious way retired General Wesley Clark handles a ringing cell phone on live T.V.  [begin video clip]  Wesley Clark: So, they've taken out an attack, some Saudi oil facilities. They were put back in place.  [phone ringing]  They've shot down, they've shot down --  Male Speaker: [laughs]  -- the -- sorry about that.  Male Speaker: That's the best --  Wesley Clark: They've shot down a drone.  Male Speaker: -- that was the best reaction to a ring I've seen on the air. Nicely done, General.  [end video clip]  Emily Compagno: [laughs]  Tom Shillue: I like the general. Tosses his phone.  [laughter]  Female Speaker: It was great.  Dana Perino: The general, first of all, I don't know what his secret is. The general does not age --  Female Speaker: At all.  Dana Perino: -- he is, looks the same.  Tom Shillue: You're right.  Dana Perino: In, like, 25 years. It's -- I would love to know his secret. Maybe it's, you know, aggression with the phone.  Tom Shillue: [laughs]  Dana Perino: Maybe that could be a little attempt.  Tom Shillue: I always turn my phone off. And first of all, like --  Lawrence Jones: Me, too.  Tom Shillue: -- things, very important things, like church, drives me crazy. So, I keep it in the car. I don't even bring it in with me.  Dana Perino: Oh, yeah.  [crosstalk]  Tom Shillue: Yeah. But the idea that -- phones going off. I went to the movies the other day; phones went off three or four times.  [crosstalk]  They're going off in church. It's driving me crazy, Lawrence.  Lawrence Jones: The only place where I'm afraid for it to go off is on T.V. And it terrifies me, so I just turns it -- I turn it back on during --  Tom Shillue: But do you ever have --  Lawrence Jones: -- during a commercial break. But after we're on air, I turn it off.  Tom Shillue: -- I just, I don't ever have a ring on at all, Marie.  Marie Harf: Me neither.  Tom Shillue: No ring.  Emily Compagno: Then how would you hear anything?  Tom Shillue: I don't answer it. I never answer the phone.  Emily Compagno: You never answer?  Tom Shillue: I'll call you back.  Marie Harf: I am constantly terrified it will go off on T.V., so I'm --  Lawrence Jones: Me, too.  Marie Harf: -- you'll see I constantly check it. But my parents watch the shows, and they text me during them. So, I keep it on.  [laughter]  I want to get their feedback.  Emily Compagno: I have the funniest story about -- oh, sorry.  Marie Harf: Church is the one that scares me the most.  Tom Shillue: Yeah.  Emily Compagno: Okay. So, we were --  Dana Perino: I agree.  Emily Compagno: -- I was hanging out at The Standard Hotel in L.A. once, and my sister also hates when other people's phones go off.  Dana Perino: I hate it.  Emily Compagno: So, someone's phone was going off, like among our things on the grass, and my sister walks over to that person's cell phone, who was probably playing in the pool, picks up his cell phone and starts yelling, ""Whose is this? Whose cell phone is this? This is -- it's ringing, it’s ringing."" And I was, I was aghast. Like, ""Natalie, you're going to get attacked.""  [laughter]  [crosstalk]  Emily Compagno: And the guy was like, ""Oh, that's mine."" It ended up being okay, but it was a very aggressive move on her part.  Tom Shillue: Yeah.  Emily Compagno: But she did what we were all feeling.  [laughter]  Tom Shillue: She could combine it with Wesley Clark, pick up the guy's phone and whip it.  Emily Compagno: [laughs]  Tom Shillue: Up next, we've all seen plenty of stories of overprivileged millennials being coddled and pampered. This one may top them all. A concerned parent reportedly posted an ad on the jobsite Indeed looking for a nanny to cook and clean for her daughter, an 18-year-old college student. The parent says the student can't be bothered with ""stress of laundry and cleaning, as her study schedule is very intense."" Oh, and don't worry, the student already has a driver. Well, that's nice. Look, she has, she has needs, Emily. And she has a concerned parent.  Emily Compagno: Of course. Well, first of all, I -- this lady better save the planet later on. She better be working on the cure for cancer --  [laughter]  -- and I'll give her all the space she needs.  Tom Shillue: Yeah.  Emily Compagno: And also, I kind of was like she should just join a sorority and then all that stuff is built in.  [laughter]  Tom Shillue: Yeah, they have -- I was in a --  Emily Compagno: You were in a sorority?  Tom Shillue: -- a male --  Marie Harf: A fraternity?  [crosstalk]  [laughter]  Dana Perino: We are all firing on, we're firing on all cylinders.  Tom Shillue: -- I was in a -- what's the male version?  Multiple Speakers: Fraternity.  Tom Shillue: Fraternity. I was there and they had dinner, they had a cook, it was amazing.  Marie Harf: It really made an impact on you.  [laughter]  Dana Perino: But I don't think at the University of Leeds that they have that. No.  [crosstalk]  Lawrence Jones: I don't actually like this. I think this parent -- I know she was trying to, like, crack a joke, but my parents would have kicked me out. There's no negotiating this.  Tom Shillue: You think she was joking? She was trying to hire a nanny for her 18-year-old daughter.  Lawrence Jones: Well, do you think -- I think it was a joke. But I also think that it's crazy.  Dana Perino: I've lived in fear all day that this is a story about a person that has special needs and that we're going to find out --  Emily Compagno: Oh, gosh.  Lawrence Jones: Oh, no. No. No.  Dana Perino: -- that could be the thing, you know.  [crosstalk]  Tom Shillue: Dana, we will all be shamed.  Lawrence Jones: Well, I apologize if --  [laughter]  Emily Compagno: Lawrence, we don't mean anything by it.  Lawrence Jones: -- I love my job [laughs].  Tom Shillue: Yeah. Well, look. People need, they need help. This -- she doesn't know how to cook, Marie.  Marie Harf: But that's her parents fault.  Lawrence Jones: Yeah.  Female Speaker: And well, maybe, someone needs a job. Maybe it'll be a match made in heaven.  Tom Shillue: Yeah.  Female Speaker: To each their own.  Tom Shillue: Finally, don't mess with the pope.  [begin video clip]  Male Speaker: Whoa [spelled phonetically].  [end video clip]  Tom Shillue: The pontiff --  Marie Harf: He's feisty.  Tom Shillue: -- blessing a woman with a slap on the hand after being grabbed while he was greeting a crowd on New Year's Eve. The pope later apologized for setting ""a bad example"" and losing his cool. But look at the woman who grabs him. I don't like the way she yanked on his arm.  Lawrence Jones: Me either.  Tom Shillue: And I think she deserved a little slap, Emily.  Emily Compagno: Absolutely. She deserved to get choked out by his security guard. I found that was so violent on her part.   Lawrence Jones: I agree.   Emily Compagno: So uncalled for and you know what he's the pope. He's not Jesus. So, I am fine with him saying, get off me. He doesn't need to apologize. The only sliver on the other coin would be that he can let the security guards be the bad guy for him and he can just kind of be like the victim for a second and let them do their job. But if that had been me in his shoes, she would be out of here.   Marie Harf: He has really tight security, too. When you watch the Christmas Eve midnight mass, there is more security for him than most people. So, I'm surprised they didn't--  Tom Shillue: The Pope shot.   Lawrence Jones: I'd say--   Marie Harf: That's right.   Lawrence Jones: Good for the pope. I'm a hugger. I love hugging people, handshakes and all that but I hate when people grab me it just--   Female Speaker: Right.   Lawrence Jones: Puts me on the defensive it's like--   Emily Compagno: It's not ok.   Lawrence Jones: I just don't like it it's like you're like pulling, taking me away or something I don't like it.   Tom Shillue: You remember the video, Dana, when he was they were going to kiss his ring and he kept pulling away. He I think he's a bit of a germophobe.   Dana Perino: Oh, maybe that's a hard thing if you're a pope, too. But I mean here's the thing he's human, who knew?   Tom Shillue: He is.   Emily Compagno: He never lost his cool, though he never loses his cool.   Tom Shillue: He didn't he said he lost his cool but I think it's OK give her a little slap.   Lawrence Jones: She landed a spanking.   Tom Shillue: Don't yank on the pope one more thing is up next.   [commercial break]  Dana Perino: All right, it's time out for one more thing, we'll wrap it up here. So did you ever go to a party or a concert and you look around the room and you think, Oh, I'm dressed just like everybody else here happens to wo-- well I guess guys a lot too. Check out this is a McKayla Angelou I'm sorry, LJ, Ellejihoe [spelled phonetically] if I'm saying that correctly. She went to a Jonas Brothers concert and she realized she was wearing the exact same outfit as everybody else in Omaha, Nebraska it was a denim jacket, black jeans and white shoes and so she started she made this little video of it and it goes on and on and on. It really was almost a uniform at the show, but apparently it was a great concert.   Tom Shillue: Yeah, I dressed up for the Jonas concert.   Dana Perino: This would definitely happen at a Dierks Bentley concert for sure .   Female Speaker: Definitely.   Lawrence Jones: Who's he?   Dana Perino: Who's he? You're joking, right?   Emily Compagno: He, kids he kids.   Dana Perino: Are you joking Lawrence.?  Lawrence Jones: No, I'm not joking.   Dana Perino: Oh my gosh, Emily.   Emily Compagno: All right I have a great story for you guys. So, you know that I love forensic DNA stuff and genetic genealogy and how it plays out with the court system. Well, there is a nonprofit called DNA DOE Project and they identify remains that have been found so that they can restore that to their family right they bring closure to family members. So, there was a missing outlaw from 1916 and a dead body was found in a cave in Utah and thanks to this nonprofit, he's now been identified. He was wearing the same clothes, by the way, that was on his last wanted poster in 1916.   Tom Shillue: A denim jacket and a pair of pants.   Lawrence Jones: With the boots with the boots.   Dana Perino: And he does sing. All right, Lawrence.   Lawrence Jones: You guys got to see this. Basketball loving and NBA-inspired brothers Valentino and Luca are 8 and 5 from Nevada and never miss a shot. You got to watch this. They nailed 38 straight baskets between them on a hyper shot arcade game without missing a single shot.   Tom Shillue: I don't see the ball.   Lawrence Jones: The mother later said the video on their social media page called Brothers Who Ball. Now the mother said they both hope to be in the NBA someday and be like Steph Curry and Seth Curry, who dad was also in the NBA.   Female Speaker: And that's imp--   Female Speaker: Wow that's amazing.   Lawrence Jones: That's pretty cool.   Dana Perino: Very cool.   Lawrence Jones: Those boys can shoot.   Emily Compagno: And with that laser thing going on like I feel like-- [crosstalk] I feel like I got a bad acid trip.   Dana Perino: All right, Marie.   Marie Harf: OK we're talking a lot about drugs. So, we talk a lot about animals on this show and we wanted to raise awareness about a pretty sad situation happening right now in Australia. Bushfires are continuing to sweep across the country billions of animals, lives are at risk with millions feared perished by the devastating fires. Good Samaritans all across Australia have stepped in to help our animal friends you can see here this group stopping in New South Wales to give thirsty cows a drink of water as firefighters battle the nearby blaze on Australia's west coast. Animals have been given treats consisting of fruit and vegetables frozen in ice box to keep hyenas, meerkats, baboons and otters cool in the rising temperatures. So, we want to say thank you to the heroes who continue to battle the fires and to those who are helping the animals of Australia. We are keeping you all in our thoughts and prayers here.   Dana Perino: That is an amazing, terrifying story down there for all the people that are evacuating as well. Tom.   Tom Shillue: Christmas cards I love them. My favorite Christmas card every year the Lobely Family Sam, Jack, Bill and Pam. They always have a great card this was the card we got this year from them. You see, it's the elf on the shelf, but they're talking him down. They have a little uh they have a little safety device there. Every year they have good cards I saved them all. OK this is in past years. This is the out of control drone it's chopping up their Christmas tree. How about this one drinking game with Santa. Santa's almost under the table at this point.   Female Speaker: These are your friends?   Tom Shillue: Yeah this is a Lobely family. They go to great lengths.   Female Speaker: They're Lobely.   Tom Shillue: How about with this one, but they're all just dressed in the hunting gear. Look who's dead in the corner. Rudolph.   Female Speaker: Oh, my God.   Tom Shillue: It's great. How about this one? The distracted family this is my favorite.   Female Speaker: Yeah that's reality.   Dana Perino: That is reality. Did you have a good time on New Year's?  Lawrence Jones: I did hang out with my friends from Dallas, and they came here, and I got the experience New York City for the first.   Dana Perino: Emily, did you have fun on New Year’s?   Emily Compagno: Yes, I did thanks to your family it was awesome.   Dana Perino: Yeah, she had a good time. I was in bed at 10:30 and you.   Marie Harf: 11:30.   Dana Perino: Alright.   Lawrence Jones: What did you do? Did you fall asleep again?   Tom Shillue: The Brian's had a great party. We rang in New Year we sang.   Dana Perino: Yeah, I did that's why I am well rested and know everybody's name.   Female Speaker: Right exactly.   Dana Perino: All right set your DVR's never miss an episode of The Five special report is up next. Bret I hope you are more with it than I was.   Bret Baier: 10:30. 10:30 Dana. Happy New Year.   Dana Perino: You too.  Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Juan Williams, co-host: Hello, everyone, I'm Juan Williams, along with Katie Pavlich, Jessie Watters, Dana Perino, and Gregory Greg Gutfeld is here. It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is ""The Five."" Merry Christmas, everyone. We're so excited to have you join us for our fun-filled Christmas special. We're answering your Yuletide questions. They come from social media, and we'll be doing it for the full hour. So grab your eggnog, and let's go. Question A, it's a Facebook question from Peggy S. -- what is the weirdest Christmas gift you ever received? Katie Pavlich. Katie Pavlich, guest co-host: I think pogs. Remember pogs? Dana Perino, co-host: No. Katie Pavlich: Like back in the day? They're like little round cardboard things that kids would play with and you just trade -- they're like baseball cards almost. And I just never was like into them. So I got them. I don't know. That's weird. Juan Williams: But it wasn't for a girl; it was for a boy. Katie Pavlich: It was gender-neutral. [LAUGHTER] Juan Williams: But clearly it didn't work for you. Katie Pavlich: It just wasn't my thing. Juan Williams: Jesse? Katie Pavlich: And I lost them. Jesse Watters, co-host: I just want to wish you a Merry Christmas, Juan. Juan Williams: Thank you. Jesse Watters: I had a great morning unwrapping gifts. It was just really beautiful to celebrate with everybody. So everybody out there, Merry Christmas. Greg Gutfeld, co-host: Was this at a La Quinta Inn? [LAUGHTER] Jesse Watters: I got coal in my stocking. Greg Gutfeld: Really? Jesse Watters: Several years in a row. Female Speaker: Sounds like a weird gift. Jesse Watters: My kids think it's a funny prank, and I don't think it's that funny. But it happens. Juan Williams: It didn't come from your parents; it came from the kids? Jesse Watters: It might've come from both. I blacked it out. Juan Williams: Did you express your displeasure? Jesse Watters: I'm a bit naughty, Juan. Very naughty. Katie Pavlich: So it's not a weird gift. It was a valid gift. Jesse Watters: Valid. Substantiated. Katie Pavlich: Yeah, okay. Got you. Juan Williams: I think it's a season of forgiveness. You know, we should -- I mean, we've got to celebrate. Jesse Watters: You don't know what I've done, Juan. Juan Williams: Well, I want to celebrate with you. It's Christmas. Dana Perino: And Mary mentioned joy. Juan Williams: Yeah. Dana. Dana Perino: Well, the weirdest gift I ever got was a gift I got last year that I can't tell you what it was. It was from my dad. And I'm not allowed to have one of these. Multiple Speakers: Oh. Jesse Watters: I think I know what it is. Greg Gutfeld: It's a weapon. Dana Perino: I'm not saying what it was. Jesse Watters: Can you just say what it is? Dana Perino: I'm just saying it was weird. No, because I don't want anyone -- Greg Gutfeld: It's a weapon that -- Jesse Watters: Yeah, we [unintelligible] Dana Perino: I don't want the NYPD to come to my department. Jesse Watters: Yes. Okay, we know what it is. Katie Pavlich: Okay. That was a weird gift. [CROSSTALK] Dana Perino: But also -- Jesse Watters: Shocking. Dana Perino: A very sweet gift. Greg Gutfeld: Gift, yes. Dana Perino: If you think about -- Jesse Watters: Shocking; it will give you that. Dana Perino: Yeah, I was shocked, completely. Greg Gutfeld: Apparently he was watching a lot of Fox News coverage [unintelligible] ""crimes getting really bad in New York."" Drops that in the mail. I'm not even sure you can mail that, but -- did he mail it? [LAUGHTER] Jesse Watters: That's a felony. Greg Gutfeld: That's a felony, across state lines. Dana Perino: But you don't know what it is. Greg Gutfeld: Yeah, it was a whip. Juan Williams: Right, let me, so -- Katie Pavlich: It was probably whiskey. Juan Williams: Whiskey? There you go. Katie Pavlich: Yeah, whiskey. Juan Williams: My wife once said to me after she had been sort of carjacked that she wanted -- Jesse Watters: “Sort of carjacked.” [CROSSTALK] Juan Williams: So anyway, she wanted a pink one and the people at the NRA and everybody else said they were going to give it to her. But you didn't have -- what color was it? Jesse Watters: What color was yours? Dana Perino: Well, I mean [unintelligible] I'm not telling you what I got. I'm not telling you -- let it remain a mystery. If I could mention one thing about that. A girlfriend of mine in April of this year -- this is five months after our Christmas show last year, her dad went into a hospital. I said -- I called, I said ""I hope your dad's feeling better."" And she said, ""well, he has one question for you."" She said ""for five months, he's been wondering what was it that your dad got you for Christmas? Juan Williams: Oh, wow. Dana Perino: And I'm like, ""so it's still a mystery. It's still the weirdest gift I ever got."" But it was out of love. Juan Williams: I believe it was. Dana Perino: It came from a place of love. Juan Williams: All right, Gregory, the weirdest Christmas gift -- Greg Gutfeld: I'm trying to think because like, I get like -- the obvious one was that unicorn jumpsuit -- [LAUGHTER] Jesse Watters: Is that true? Greg Gutfeld: -- that was given to me on The Five Christmas show like four years ago, which inflated, and it was -- you could look it up, it's somewhere. Or just drop it in. But I -- you know what I was thinking -- the album ""I Robot"" by Alan Parsons Project. Jesse Watters: I have no idea what that means. Greg Gutfeld: You don't know Al? It's a whole album -- it's the guy who produced Dark Side of the Moon. It's a great -- but my sister gives it to me. I never heard of this guy and then I ended up listening to the album every day for like a year. But it was all about robots. Jesse Watters: Oh. Is that the one where if you sync it up to the Dorothy -- Greg Gutfeld: That's Dark Side of the Moon. Jesse Watters: Oh, okay. Greg Gutfeld: To The Wizard of Oz? Jesse Watters: Right, Wizard of Oz. Greg Gutfeld: Because if you sync it up to The Wizard of Oz, you -- it all [unintelligible] Jesse Watters: Right when the lion roars. Greg Gutfeld: But you've got to smoke something really strong for it to work. Juan Williams: That's legal in many states. Greg Gutfeld: But don't mail it. [CROSSTALK] Juan Williams: By the way, Jesse, you have a special place in this show. Jesse Watters: Why? Juan Williams: Because the weirdest Christmas gift I ever got was that snowflake suit. Jesse Watters: Yes, the snowflake suit. Juan Williams: Because, you know -- Jesse Watters: Why aren't you wearing it? It's Christmas. Juan Williams: Well, because you know how liberals are. We're snowflakes. Jesse Watters: Yeah. Juan Williams: I liked it so much, even though it was a weird gift, that I wore it at home for my family on Christmas Day last year. Jesse Watters: Perfect. Katie Pavlich: Like the whole day? Juan Williams: Well, yes. I think I wore it through dinner. I don't know about the whole [unintelligible]; I don't know if I went out afterwards. Katie Pavlich: It's very festive. Juan Williams: Actually, it's a fun suit. Jesse Watters: It is. Juan Williams: All right. The second question for our Christmas special, this one comes from Lindsey C. -- it says, ""What's the most annoying Christmas song?"" I'm going to go first on this one. The Chipmunks. You know, ""oh, Alvin."" I'm like, ""wow."" Yeah, Greg? Jesse Watters: We're just doing Feliz Navidad. Katie Pavlich: Prospero ano y felicidad. Jesse Watters: Yeah. Katie Pavlich: You told me I don't know any other Spanish songs, and I do. Jesse Watters: And I said only Ricky Martin. But that is the most annoying Spanish song, in my opinion. Katie Pavlich: It's the best song [unintelligible] Juan Williams: Excuse me. Christmas. Jesse Watters: Christmas song. Dana Perino: I'm going to have to agree with Jesse. Jesse Watters: Help me out. Dana Perino: And I'll tell you why. I'm going to agree with you. Greg Gutfeld: You're all racist. That's -- Katie Pavlich: I love that song. I love it. Dana Perino: Years ago -- Jesse Watters: Feliz Navidad, everybody. Dana Perino: Feliz Navidad. Years ago, Peter and I invited my sister to Washington, D.C. for Christmas. And as a surprise, we brought her to New York for her first time. Juan Williams: Wow. Dana Perino: And at one point, we got on the subway to go from point A to point B, and there was a guy on the subway who had a terrible voice and he was singing Feliz Navidad over and over and over again for money. And we got stuck in the subway. Greg Gutfeld: It was Brian Williams. Dana Perino: And he just kept playing it over and over again. So anytime I hear it now, it's not like the wonderful version; all I can imagine hearing is that guy's really bad [unintelligible] Jesse Watters: He ruined it for you. Juan Williams: Why, was he drunk? Dana Perino: No. Juan Williams: No. Dana Perino: I think that he was just -- Greg Gutfeld: Making money. Juan Williams: Just giving it a shot. Yeah. And I -- I think that you're right. Greg Gutfeld: He's a busker. Dana Perino: He just didn't deserve a lot of money. Juan Williams: Which is one of the great words in the language. Greg Gutfeld: Yes. I will say every single Christmas song there is, every single one is annoying and it's annoying because they aren't -- Jesse Watters: It's Christmas. Greg Gutfeld: Good enough songs to be played year-round. They're like -- they're like the turkey. You only have turkey once a year because it's a mediocre bird. Both of these Christmas songs have mediocre melodies, are incredibly annoying. And so we have -- we're forced to listen to them from the end of November to the end of December. They make me sick to my stomach. I'm sorry, America, but you asked the question. They're the worst songs on Earth. And if God wanted to, he'd agree with me. Jesse Watters: Okay. Juan Williams: If God wanted, he may agree with you. I don't know. But wait, so, let me take you into your deep Grinch-most mode and ask you then what is your favorite Christmas hymn? Katie Pavlich: He doesn't have one. None of them. Dana Perino: None of them, right? Juan Williams: None of them, that's true. Greg Gutfeld: Anarchy in the U.K. by the Sex Pistols. Juan Williams: I don't even know what to say. I don't know what to say. Anyway, did you -- what was it? Katie Pavlich: I somewhat agree with Greg, but only post -- or pre-Thanksgiving. So any Christmas song that is played before Thanksgiving. Dana Perino: What about after New Year's? Katie Pavlich: And after New Year's. So there is a period of time. It's the day after Thanksgiving through December 25th. And then it's just stop. Jesse Watters: It's like wearing white after Labor Day. You just can't do it. No, you can do that, but you can't [unintelligible] Greg Gutfeld: Only if you're in the alt-right. [LAUGHTER] Jesse Watters: My God, Greg. Juan Williams: But here's the reality. Right now, on November 1st, they start playing Christmas songs. Katie Pavlich: But they're ruining it. It's like extending it way too long. Juan Williams: All right. Katie Pavlich: You take the value and the fun out of it. Greg Gutfeld: Christmas should only be once every four years the way they used to do with the Olympics. Then we'd appreciate it more. We'd save more money. We'd be able to afford mortgages and college. But instead, every year we spend all this money giving each other gifts that we don't even like. Katie Pavlich: It's good capitalism. Greg Gutfeld: Yeah. That's true. Juan Williams: All right. Question number three, from you. It comes from Kent B. It says what's everyone's favorite Christmas memory? I'm going to go to somebody who comes from the land of snow and ranches. Dana Perino. Dana Perino: Well, actually, my favorite memory was from being up in Newcastle, Wyoming, with all my family gathered. My father and -- had two brothers and cousins and we were all there together. And there was one year where it snowed so badly that we really couldn't go anywhere, and we ended up playing cards the whole weekend. But we also -- we had those old wooden long sleds. Juan Williams: Oh, yeah. Juan Williams: And my grandfather would put us all in back of the pickup, and we would go up to the top, and then one uncle and my dad -- my dad and then my uncles would be on there with the rest of the kids to put some weight, and we would fly down these gullies, and my grandfather would drive down, pick us up so we didn't have to walk back up the hill over and over again. Then we'd come back to the house and say, you know, to my grandmother, ""Mama put on the hot chocolate."" And -- Juan Williams: Well -- Dana Perino: So it wasn't a gift. It was just being up there. Juan Williams: I think that's a gift. That was wonderful. Greg. Dana Perino: Well, no, I mean -- never mind. Juan Williams: [LAUGHS] Okay. Greg Gutfeld: You know, I grew up in Northern California, and I think it only snowed once in my entire life there. So we went to Skyline Boulevard and people had a -- nobody had sleds because it was Northern California. Dana Perino: Didn't have them. Greg Gutfeld: So we're Skyline, which is above CSM College in San Mateo, and we're like sliding on the lids of garbage can. Katie Pavlich: Yeah. That's awesome. Greg Gutfeld: And we went to a donut shop and had donuts. Dana Perino: Great memory. Greg Gutfeld: Yeah. And then I killed a drifter. [LAUGHTER] Juan Williams: That was wonderful. Jesse Watters: So your favorite Christmas was a white Christmas. Greg Gutfeld: [LAUGHS] I know. Jesse Watters: Okay, Greg. Typical. [LAUGHTER] Juan Williams: So what was your favorite? Jesse Watters: My favorite Christmas was this Christmas. Greg Gutfeld: Aww. Jesse Watters: It has been such a great Christmas. I had so much fun this morning with the Yule and the tide and the trees. It's just been beautiful. Feliz Navidad. Katie Pavlich: What was the weather like today? Jesse Watters: It was -- [LAUGHTER] -- balmy, actually, Katie. Dana Perino: Inside. Jesse Watters: Inside. [LAUGHS] Juan Williams: All right. Your favorite, Katie. Katie Pavlich: Oh, I grew up in the snowy part of Arizona. So I think my favorite Christmas memory is where my dad would hook up sleds to the back of the pickup truck. Dana Perino: Oh, that's pretty fun. Greg Gutfeld: There you go. Katie Pavlich: We live out, like, in the middle of nowhere. Dana Perino: Like water skiing? Jesse Watters: Like donuts. Katie Pavlich: Basically, and -- Dana Perino: Oh. Katie Pavlich: They didn't plow the roads. Dana Perino: Don't try this at home. Katie Pavlich: Yeah, don't try this at home. But we did, and I survived. Greg Gutfeld: [LAUGHS] Katie Pavlich: They wouldn't plow the road, so he would just drag us in the back of the truck through the roads. And it was so much fun. Dana Perino: Wow. Katie Pavlich: We would do that. And there was another time where he came home with a puppy, and that was pretty good. Dana Perino: [gasps] Jesse Watters: Oh, that's pretty nice. Dana Perino: Oh, wow. Juan Williams: Wow. Wait, what -- Katie Pavlich: Yeah. And my mom would always make amazing Christmas rolls, so those were always really good. Juan Williams: Wait. I saw your face when you said puppy. It was like, ""Urgh.” Katie Pavlich: Well, that's the best thing you can get at Christmas time. Juan Williams: I think it's wonderful. Jesse Watters: Oh, no. Juan Williams: I thought you were saying maybe you had some reservations. Katie Pavlich: Oh, never. Juan Williams: No? Katie Pavlich: Give me all of them. Jesse Watters: You can also get a car with the big red bow on top. That beats a puppy any day. Dana Perino: [LAUGHS] Greg Gutfeld: You know, what's great? If you drive the car with the bow, and the gift is the bow. ""Oh, look at the bow I got you.” [LAUGHTER] ""I'll take it off my car that I got for myself."" Dana Perino: But if you got a Peloton, that would be great. Greg Gutfeld: Yes. Katie Pavlich: It would be great. Juan Williams: Oh. Katie Pavlich: Actually. Juan Williams: You want to bring up controversy? Well, by the way, so mine is kind of sentimental. I remember once, you know, my dad wasn't there, and we didn't have much money. And my brother went out like on Christmas Eve. He said, ""Come with me."" And we went and we got the last Christmas tree on the Christmas tree lot, and we were dragging it home. Later in my life, I always think it reminded me of like, you know, peanuts or something. Dana Perino: Yeah, yeah. Katie Pavlich: Yeah. That's cute. Juan Williams: All right. One last question. This one is an Instagram question, and it comes from Loretta Fogate [spelled phonetically] at Fogate.35. What's your favorite Christmas movie? Dana Perino: That's mine. Juan Williams: Who wants to start? Oh, wait. [cross talk] Dana Perino: I never saw it. Jesse Watters: You never saw Die Hard? Dana Perino: I don't think so. I think it's -- Jesse Watters: Dana. Dana Perino: But I do think it's a Christmas movie. [LAUGHS] Juan Williams: It is a Christmas movie. Jesse Watters: I saw Home Alone the other day, and, man, that movie is good. Juan Williams: That's a fun movie. Katie Pavlich: That's funny. Yeah. Jesse Watters: And then I saw Home Alone Two, and it's underrated. Juan Williams: I've not seen it. Jesse Watters: People think Home Alone Two is not that good. It stands up there. Juan Williams: By the way, why were you watching? Jesse Watters: You know, Netflix has a lot of stuff -- Juan Williams: [LAUGHS] All right. Jesse Watters: -- and Disney +. And, you know, it keeps going after you finished one movie. Juan Williams: And it's picked up. Katie Pavlich: It's a Wonderful Life. A classic. Juan Williams: Yeah. That's a great movie. Dana Perino: That's a good one. Juan Williams: That's a great movie. Greg Gutfeld: Clockwork Orange. Jesse Watters: [LAUGHS] You are dark. Greg Gutfeld: It's good. The book is good -- Dana Perino: And Love, Actually was -- Greg Gutfeld: -- the move is better. Dana Perino: -- a great Christmas movie. Greg Gutfeld: One of the worst movies ever made. Juan Williams: And now we're going to start a Christmas dinner fight between Dana and Greg. Katie Pavlich: Dana started the big debate, which is, is Die Hard Christmas movie? Juan Williams: It is -- but it is a Christmas movie, isn't it? Katie Pavlich: There are people who would disagree. Juan Williams: Why? Jesse Watters: What happens on Christmas? Juan Williams: What do you mean? Jesse Watters: The movie. Dana Perino: [LAUGHS] Katie Pavlich: I mean, I would say it is. Jesse Watters: It happens on Christmas. Juan Williams: Yeah. Oh, the movie does take place on Christmas. Yes. Katie Pavlich: But is -- I don't know. I there are some people who say it is not. I'm not one of them. So I don't know. Juan Williams: By the way, the other day I was watching a cable and up came Miracle on 34th Street, which I think is a pretty good movie. Dana Perino: I think that is a good one, too. Juan Williams: You know what? It got like two stars. Jesse Watters: Yeah. Never seen it. Dana Perino: Oh. Juan Williams: Come on. Jesse Watters: You haven't seen Die Hard. [LAUGHTER] Get out of here. Juan Williams: All right. We're just getting started. Stay right there, The Five's Christmas special returns with more funny questions straight ahead. Stay with us. [COMMERCIAL BREAK] Dana Perino: Well, welcome back to our Christmas special. We're going to answer more of your questions. I got some good ones here. All right, Greg, I'm going to start with you. Greg Gutfeld: Yay. Dana Perino: This is from Joanel C. [spelled phonetically] from Facebook. Would you rather live where it only snows or the temperature never falls below 100 degrees? Greg Gutfeld: These are weird questions because I don't believe in the prison of two ideas, Dana. Dana Perino: Oh, you have an unbending mind. Greg Gutfeld: But to say that you can either have this or have this, that's not how the world works. There's an infinite -- Dana Perino: It's just a fun question. Greg Gutfeld: Is it a fun question really? Dana Perino: Yeah. It's so fun. Greg Gutfeld: I would definitely go with heat over cold because I could always have a nice swimming pool built. You could always cool down with air conditioning, but when it's cold, you just don't want to go outside because it's cold. Dana Perino: I think you're going to say heat. Katie Pavlich: Heat. Yes. Dana Perino: Even though you grew up in the snow. Jesse, don't change -- Katie Pavlich: I mean, I like-- Jesse Watters: I'm looking at the question. Katie Pavlich: -- I like I'm looking at the pine trees in the snow. I just couldn't do it forever. It's like a weekend thing. Dana Perino: Yes. Snow once in a while or -- over 100 degrees, though. Jesse? Over a -- Katie Pavlich: Is it dry? Jesse Watters: What kind of heat is it, then? Katie Pavlich: Yeah. Jesse Watters: What is it, Dana? Dana Perino: It doesn't say. Jesse Watters: Is it a dry heat? Dana Perino: Which would you prefer? Jesse Watters: A dry heat. Dana Perino: Yes. Jesse Watters: Yes. I'm going to take the under. Dana Perino: Okay. [LAUGHTER] Greg Gutfeld: We're going to end up there anyway at some point. It'll be called Florida, though,. Dana Perino: That's right. [LAUGHTER] [cross talk] That's a moist heat. Juan Williams: The village has -- Dana Perino: That's a humid head. All right. Juan, do you like heat? Juan Williams: I like heat because I don't like cold weather. But I do think that it's pretty special to have snow. I guess, you know, because I've been indoctrinated by American visions of what a perfect Christmas is, and a perfect Christmas is snowy. Dana Perino: I think if Kennedy were here, she would say snow. Katie Pavlich: Yeah, probably. Dana Perino: Pretty sure. Right. She wants to ski and snowboard and all that fun stuff. All right. Another question from Karen D. What was the one chore you disliked doing growing up? Jesse, did you have a chore? Jesse Watters: Yeah, I had to do the baseboards. You know, the baseboards -- Dana Perino: Oh, yeah. Jesse Watters: -- at the bottom of the wall near the floor. And so my mom would say, ""Get a bucket, fill it with hot water, puts some Mr. Clean in there and then take a wet rag and dip it in there and then just scrub the baseboards all over the house. You know, that gave me back problems I think. Bending over so much as a young child I think it was abusive. Dana Perino: Katie what about you? Katie Pavlich: You know, your mom would say she has back problems for having a kid, right? Jesse Watters: Yeah. Katie Pavlich: That's worse. I bartered with my brother not to have to clean the bathrooms. Dana Perino: Oh what would you barter? Katie Pavlich: So we would trade chores. So I would vacuum and do like the garage -- Dana Perino: I love to vacuum. Katie Pavlich: -- or the kitchen, empty the dishwasher but he would cover the bathrooms. [CROSSTALK] Dana Perino: You can make like the nice the like the lines in the carpet. Jesse Watters: That's not a chore. Dana Perino: Juan. Katie Pavlich: That's a chore. Jesse Watters: Vacuuming. Dana Perino: Yes. Oh really want to tell women all across -- Katie Pavlich: It's a chore. Dana Perino: -- America vacuuming's not a chore. Jesse Watters: Compared to what I did the baseboards. That's grueling. Vacuuming, you stand up and go [makes sounds] Katie Pavlich: Not if you get under the couch. Dana Perino: Unless you're like Greg and you have a Roomba. Greg Gutfeld: Yes. Katie Pavlich: Yeah. That would help. Dana Perino: Juan, did you have a chore you didn't like? Juan Williams: You know, I didn't like taking out the trash. And the reason is that if you live in an apartment building, you have to go out in the hallway, and then down to the garbage chute. Right? And sometimes there'd be bad guys there, Dana. [LAUGHTER] Dana Perino: I know. I know well. Greg, what about you? Greg Gutfeld: Trying to think if I really had any chores? Dana Perino: Oh, spoiled. Greg Gutfeld: Yeah. I mean, no but I got paid for what I did. Is that a chore? Dana Perino: Yeah. Greg Gutfeld: It's mowing lawns, washing cars. Dana Perino: Yeah. Greg Gutfeld: I did a lot of fun stuff. Usually wore cutoff jeans, shirtless. [LAUGHTER] Dana Perino: Did you get paid for that? Greg Gutfeld: Yes. Extra actually. [LAUGHTER] [cross talk] Katie Pavlich: -- passing by. Jesse Watters: The neighbors threw money at me. Juan Williams: I'll tell you -- Jesse Watters: ""Bend over.” Greg Gutfeld: It was so degrading. Juan Williams: Those California girls. Greg Gutfeld: It was so degrading. Dana Perino: I tell you, the worst chore for us was changing the cat litter box. Jesse Watters: That's not good. Dana Perino: That is not a fun chore. Katie Pavlich: Oh I can do another one. We had to go out -- we had pigeons for the Labradors that we would train. Greg Gutfeld: Oh, interesting. Katie Pavlich: And we had to feed the pigeons, and it was really cold. Dana Perino: What did you feed them? Katie Pavlich: Just like pigeon food. I don't know. Bird feed. Dana Perino: Yeah. Katie Pavlich: We had to go out and feed them. Juan Williams: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Katie Pavlich: In like 20 degree weather. It was terrible. Juan Williams: There's an area there's an unbelievable story hidden in there. Katie Pavlich: I'm not going to tell the rats because PETA will be after me. Dana Perino: All right. Well-- Juan Williams: Oh, that's why you had the pigeons. Dana Perino: All right. Greg, if you could teach one college class, what would it be? Greg Gutfeld: Oh, it would have -- the media and why they lie to you. That's what it would be. Dana Perino: Okay. [LAUGHTER] Juan Williams: I think he would be at liberty. Greg Gutfeld: It's already being done. [LAUGHTER] Jesse Watters: I would teach ambush journalism 101. It was really the only thing I was ever good at -- Greg Gutfeld: [LAUGHS] Jesse Watters: -- and I've done it more than anybody. Greg Gutfeld: That's true. Jesse Watters: And I know how to do it. Greg Gutfeld: Yeah. Dana Perino: That's true. Katie. Katie Pavlich: I would teach a history class that's pro-America because it doesn't really happen. Dana Perino: Oh. Greg Gutfeld: That's so not a Fox News answer. Katie Pavlich: Whatever. I don't care. That's what I would do. Dana Perino: Juan? Juan Williams: I guess it's great ideas. I would be interested -- you know, I was a philosophy major. I think you were a philosophy major. Jesse Watters: Yeah, and then I changed the history. Juan Williams: There you go. Jesse Watters: After I got to cont. Juan Williams: I wish. [LAUGHTER] Jesse Watters: I was like, ""Uh, I'm changing majors."" Juan Williams: Actually, now at this point in life I wish that I had done history or political science, but I did philosophy, and I am still interested in great ideas. Like how do you live a good life? That would be, you know. Dana Perino: I would teach a class on, especially for women, in finding their strong voice because it helps in all sorts aspects of your life, career, being able to actually present in a way that will help make sure that you have opportunities for promotion and things like that. Greg Gutfeld: In the spirit, in the Christmas spirit, let me tell you, Greg, and I think I agree that they should teach you how to balance a checkbook, how to invest in stock -- Dana Perino: I think the parents should do that. Juan Williams: Well, I mean, somebody should do it. Right? Dana Perino: Like you shouldn't have to pay tuition to have somebody tell you how to balance your checkbook. Juan Williams: Well no, there are lots of life skills that I just didn't. I don't know. Dana Perino: Yeah. Katie Pavlich: We used to have home ec, and then they took it away. Dana Perino: I loved home ec. I made, a cupcake pillow. [LAUGHTER] Okay. Greg. Greg Gutfeld: Yes. Dana Perino: This is from Henry S. What is your favorite time of the day and why? Greg Gutfeld: Oh, geez my favorite time of the day is when you wake up and you realize you have like two more hours of sleep. That's my favorite. So like -- Dana Perino: Oh, and you can go right back to sleep? Greg Gutfeld: Yeah, I'm talking at like 10:00 a.m. like when you wake up at 10, and, ""It's only 10:00 a.m."" and then I just go back to sleep. Jesse Watters: [LAUGHS] ""I don't have to be at work until 5."" [LAUGHTER] Greg Gutfeld: Yes. The best time is when you wake up and you still have time to sleep. Everybody does that. They always wake, and they're so excited when they look at it and it says -- Katie Pavlich: That's true. Juan Williams: You know what, you what this means? Greg Gutfeld: What? Juan Williams: You're an old man. Greg Gutfeld: Yes. [LAUGHS] Juan Williams: Because I can tell you from personal experience -- Greg Gutfeld: I knew that. Dana Perino: Juan, your favorite time of day? Juan Williams: Well, I would guess that it's, you know, like work is done, and I don't have any writing or something to do. And I just like, ""Hey, this is my time. I can have a beer. I can sit and watch The Five on rerun or baseball. Or I can call up Jesse and complain."" Dana Perino: You watch The Five on rerun? [LAUGHTER] Juan Williams: I have, but I don't. I don't make it -- but I do watch -- you know what I watch? Jesse Watters: He's watching this right now. Juan Williams: You know what I watch? I watch I watch Family Feud. Katie Pavlich: I love the Family Feud. Dana Perino: Ah, nice. Katie Pavlich: Favorite time of day I think dawn, because no one else is awake. You can go get stuff done. You're by yourself. You have some peace and quiet. Get your coffee, go workout, read a little bit. Dana Perino: Get a lot of stuff done. Katie Pavlich: And then you have the rest of the day. Dana Perino: Jesse? Katie Pavlich: As long as you get plenty of sleep. Dana Perino: Jesse? Jesse Watters: Yeah, I'm a morning person like Katie, but I also like 8:59. You want to know why? Hannity is almost on, and it's just that anticipation of the monologue. [LAUGHTER] It's just so good. Dana Perino: I like dusk or the golden hour. Katie Pavlich: Yeah. Jesse Watters: Oh, yeah. Dana Perino: Not when I'm working, but like on a Saturday and Sunday. That's definitely my favorite time. All right. Who would be the first person we'd contact in an emergency? Here at Fox News, the answer when The Five's Christmas fan mail special continues. [COMMERCIAL BREAK] Mike Emmanuel: Merry Christmas from Fox News in Washington, I'm Mike Emmanuel. The Five continues in a moment, but first, this Special Report news break. Breaking tonight from the Middle East, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly rushed to a bomb shelter. A rocket was fired in the direction of where he was holding a campaign event. President Trump and first lady Melania are wishing each and every American a Merry Christmas. They're also sending their holiday greetings to our troops stationed around the globe. And in a written statement, the president's calling for deeper understanding and respect as we head into a new year. Meanwhile, the Cal in California, the Democratic governor, just paroled an illegal immigrant from Cambodia who had spent 22 years in prison for killing a rival gang member. He was then immediately turned over to federal ICE authorities for possible deportation. I'll be back at 6:00 p.m. Eastern time for a live special report now back to The Five. Jesse Watters: Merry Christmas, everybody. Welcome back to The Five's Christmas special. We're going to answer some more of your questions from social media. All right. Number one, Facebook question, Kimberly D. -- if you had an emergency, who at Fox News would be the first person you called for help? Juan? Juan Williams: Well, it would have to do with the nature of the emergency. Now if someone's trying to kill me, I guess I'd call security. Jesse Watters: Okay. Greg Gutfeld: It would probably be me. Juan Williams: Yes. Greg Gutfeld: You couldn't call me cause I'd be chasing you with an ax. Juan Williams: No, no, no. Can't be you. That's not fair. You'd have to protect me, Greg. Jesse Watters: Like who is your emergency contact? Juan Williams: At Fox News? Jesse Watters: Yes. Like if there is a problem. Juan Williams: I would guess it's Megan Albano who is the boss of this show, right? Jesse Watters: Okay. Call the boss. Okay. Not the person I would call but Dana. Dana Perino: I'm going to go with Sean Hannity. Jesse Watters: Why is that? Dana Perino: Because he always takes your calls. He has the resources to help you. And he will make you feel better about whatever has happened. Jesse Watters: That is true. Katie Pavlich: That is true. Jesse Watters: Sean does have a very tender, loving touch. [LAUGHTER] I would definitely call Dr. Marc Siegel. because that, you know, speaks to the emergency that I would be having. Greg Gutfeld: That, you took mine. Jesse Watters: I did? Greg Gutfeld: Yes. Female Speaker: Yes. Greg Gutfeld: Because I think I must call Dr. Marc Siegel at least three times a day, 99 percent for no reason at all. So I'm going to have to go with Kilmeade because Kilmeade is always here. Jesse Watters: That's true. Greg Gutfeld: And whenever you see Kilmeade, do you notice he always has a backpack? Juan Williams: What's in that? Greg Gutfeld: He's like that oldest guy with a backpack, he's always walking around with -- so I figure it must got stuff in the backpack -- Jesse Watters: Yes. Greg Gutfeld: -- in case I'm trapped in an elevator. Actually, you know what? Jesse Watters: What? Greg Gutfeld: Rick Leventhal. You think about Rick Le -- he would -- Rick Leventhal is our, is our -- Dana Perino: Driver. Greg Gutfeld: John McClane. Jesse Watters: Oh, right. Greg Gutfeld: If you're stuck in an elevator, remember when he was stuck in the elevator, when Leventhal was stuck in an elevator? Do you remember that? Dana Perino: No. Katie Pavlich: No. Greg Gutfeld: Oh, look it up. Google it. But he'd crawl through the little slot and get you out of there. Jesse Watters: The man is -- Greg Gutfeld: Leventhal, Kilmeade, Dr. Siegel -- that's your super friends. And Hannity. Juan Williams: Wait a minute, wait a minute. I thought you'd call Tyrus. Greg Gutfeld: That's true. But Tyrus lives, you know, he doesn't live nearby. Jesse Watters: He's not on-site like Kilmeade. Greg Gutfeld: Yes, I need somebody on-site. Katie Pavlich: I would call Johnny Joey Jones because he's a Marine. He would know what to do. And he knows all the other Marines so they could come with medical supplies and guns and all helicopters. Everything we would need [unintelligible] Jesse Watters: Call the cavalry. Dana Perino: Hannity has that, too. Jesse Watters: That's true. And he needs it. All right, Instagram question from Gunner Baker. ""If you could only eat at one restaurant for the rest of your life -- no pressure -- where would it be and why?"" Greg? Greg Gutfeld: I can't say because it would put the poor place out of business. There's a Chinese restaurant that has my favorite ribs, which I order maybe three times a week when I'm on my way home. It's downtown. Jesse Watters: Every night, ribs for the rest of your life. Greg Gutfeld: Yes, but then put it with Chinese food. They have like 300 other options and also they got fried chicken. Jesse Watters: That's true. Such a healthy guy, Greg Gutfeld. Juan Williams: I think if you were Jewish, that'd be your Christmas dinner. Greg Gutfeld: I guess that's true. Jesse Watters: That's it. That's where everybody is eating the night. Right? All right, Juan? Juan Williams: Well, it depends. If I was in Washington, it'd be Ocean Air, which is a great seafood restaurant. But if I'm in New York, I go across the street to Oceana, which is another great seafood -- because we have a wide variety of seafood. Jesse Watters: Wow, you're getting paid well, Juan. Juan Williams: I know some of these people don't eat seafood. I don't understand. I love seafood. Jesse Watters: He doesn't eat it. Greg Gutfeld: Nothing. Jesse Watters: You should hear what he says about the ocean. [LAUGHTER] Juan Williams: Didn't you hear what Dana said?. Jesse Watters: I know, both of them have issues. Juan Williams: Okay. Jesse Watters: What do you think, Katie? Katie Pavlich: I would do that place called Acqua Al 2. Juan Williams: Oh, I love that. Katie Pavlich: In D.C. Juan Williams: Yes. Katie Pavlich: Because it's an Italian place, but they have everything, salad, steak and the best pasta in town. Juan Williams: Not only that, they have all the Washington Nationals eat there. Katie Pavlich: That's true. You can hang out and party. Jesse Watters: Is your answer Del Frisco's because my answer is Del Frisco's. Dana Perino: My answer is not Del Frisco's because obviously you're doing very well, and your wallet must be very fat if you're eating at Del Frisco's. Jesse Watters: Well, there's other options. You don't have to get the crab. Dana Perino: No, I want to mention something that's not as famous, but Greg knows this restaurant. It's the West Side Steakhouse. Greg Gutfeld: Ah, yeah. Jesse Watters: Oh. Dana Perino: It's on 10th Avenue in New York. And a great owner and lovely -- his lovely wife there. And while they have a wonderful menu, they'll make you anything you want. Jesse Watters: Anything? Dana Perino: Anything you want. Greg Gutfeld: Wait. People are going to now go there and start ordering things that they don't have. They go ""Dana Perino says, I want lobster thermidors."" [LAUGHTER] [unintelligible] Jesse Watters: I was just about to say that. Dana Perino: Well, they could probably make it. Jesse Watters: Yes. Greg Gutfeld: I don't think they have lobster there, but who knows? Maybe they do. Jesse Watters: Okay, well, I'm going to go there and test that theory, Dana. You guys better be ready for us. All right. Instagram question from Le Groan Ellen [spelled phonetically], ""what do you miss most about your hometown?"" I miss the cheese sticks in Philly. Just going out, getting a cheese steak anytime. No car. Greg Gutfeld: Where'd you go, Pat's? Jesse Watters: -- in your cheese steak, no calories. Greg Gutfeld: You go to Pat's? Jesse Watters: Those are for tourists. No one really goes there. Greg Gutfeld: Wait, where did you go then? Jesse Watters: Local places like Chubby's, Dalessandro's, you know. Greg Gutfeld: Okay. Jesse Watters: What about you? Greg Gutfeld: What do I -- I miss the [unintelligible] mall in the old days, like the old-fashioned shopping malls where you had like the Chess King, Wet Seal, Spencer's. It was just the tackiest place in the world. But that's where everybody went when you were from like 7 years old to 17 was the mall. Now we have it on. Now we have Amazon. Jesse Watters: Is that where you wore those short jean shorts with the tank top? Greg Gutfeld: Yes. That's where I'd get my -- never mind. [LAUGHTER] I almost said -- it was going to be edited out anyway, so why say it? Juan Williams: What is the Chess King? Greg Gutfeld: It was just a terrible clothing store. Juan Williams: Oh. Dana Perino: Yeah. Greg Gutfeld: Merry Go Round. Remember Merry Go Round? Jesse Watters: I've never heard of any of these places. Dana Perino: Boutique Sophisticate? [LAUGHTER] You probably shopped there. Greg Gutfeld: No, I was a Baby GAP. Dana Perino: Baby GAPper [spelled phonetically] Jesse Watters: Dana, what do you miss? Dana Perino: Mountain views. Jesse Watters: Mountain views. Dana Perino: Yeah. Jesse Watters: Because you didn't really have a town. Greg Gutfeld: You should go to Mountain View, California. Dana Perino: Yeah, I should. Greg Gutfeld: Terrible joke. Jesse Watters: We're going to edit that out. What about you? What do you miss? Katie Pavlich: I miss mountains and open space. Dana Perino: Yeah. Katie Pavlich: Hiking. Clear air, clean air. Dana Perino: I miss driving. Katie Pavlich: Yeah. Driving around. Dana Perino: I don't drive any. Katie Pavlich: Eighty miles an hour speed limit. Jesse Watters: That's the speed limit? Katie Pavlich: Yep. That's what it was. Greg Gutfeld: That's amazing. Katie Pavlich: Yep, everyone goes [unintelligible] Greg Gutfeld: In California -- I mean, in New York, the average, what is it three miles an hour in Manhattan? That's the average. Juan Williams: That's terrible. Jesse Watters: Yeah. Greg Gutfeld: Yeah. Did we do you, Juan? What do you [unintelligible]? Juan Williams: No, I mean, look, it doesn't fit, but I mean, it's the truth. I was like a street urchin in Brooklyn, New York. So playing basketball on the streets, stickball on the street, being on the streets to the point where people are worried about what's going on with this guy. I liked it actually; I had a great time. Jesse Watters: You just don't miss taking out the garbage. Juan Williams: That's true. Jesse Watters: That's true. Okay Facebook question from Paul A. -- how do you deal with a bad hair day? I don't know. I've never had one. [LAUGHTER] Can't answer that question. Katie, what do you do? Katie Pavlich: I just put my hair in a ponytail. Jesse Watters: Ponytail? Katie Pavlich: Yeah, or a bun. [CROSSTALK] Jesse Watters: Ponytail. Juan? Juan Williams: I go to makeup. We have professionals here. Juan Williams: I need help. Jesse Watters: Greg, what do you throw a hat on? Greg Gutfeld: I just adjust it. I just adjust or I get another one. [LAUGHTER] Jesse Watters: Okay. Do we have time for one more? Juan Williams: Wait, wait. Greg Gutfeld: They've been teasing for the last two minutes. Juan Williams: Wait, but Dana never answered. Dana Perino: I did. Ponytail. Juan Williams: Oh, ponytail. Jesse Watters: Ponytail. Come on, we got to go. Greg, we got to go. What is the most opinion that we have? Find out when we return. [COMMERCIAL BREAK] Greg Gutfeld: Now, that's a holiday song. Fifty third and third by the Ramones. [LAUGHTER] Look it up, has an interesting meaning. All right. First question, Instagram from Joni, I guess. What's your most unpopular opinion? I think donuts are overrated. That's not an unpopular opinion. That's just stupid. Katie Pavlich: [LAUGHS] Greg Gutfeld: You're just a stupid person. Juan Williams: Wow. Greg Gutfeld: No. Donuts are the greatest thing ever made. It just they give you a little heartburn because they're so filled with so much sugar. Dana, what's your most unpopular opinion? Dana Perino: So, I think it's that I still am on the fence and against the legalization of marijuana. Greg Gutfeld: Yeah, that's okay. Dana Perino: Yeah. Greg Gutfeld: That's all right. That's not so -- Dana Perino: That's unpopular now. Greg Gutfeld: Yeah. But that's all right. That upsets Jesse because he's high right now. Juan Williams: [LAUGHS] Greg Gutfeld: Jesse, I think you're -- Jesse Watters: What's up, dude? Juan Williams: [LAUGHS] Greg Gutfeld: You're flying. Jesse Watters: Oh, man. I was just going back in time for a second, man. This morning was so cool. [LAUGHTER] All the lights on the trees. Greg Gutfeld: All right. What's your unpopular opinion? Jesse Watters: You know, usually people don't disagree with me. I don't have a lot of unpopular opinions. Greg Gutfeld: [LAUGHS] That's so true. Jesse Watters: I know my unpopular opinion at home is that Trump is a great president. Greg Gutfeld: [LAUGHS] Yeah. Jesse Watters: That is a very unpopular opinion in the Watters household. Greg Gutfeld: That is true. That is true. Juan, unpopular opinion. Juan Williams: Are you kidding? I work here. [LAUGHTER] Come on. Be for real. Jesse Watters: That's why we have you. Juan Williams: Yeah, really. Greg Gutfeld: Katie? Katie Pavlich: I would say my unpopular opinion is that trophy hunting is actually beneficial in a lot of places in Africa. Multiple Speakers: Oh. Jesse Watters: That is probably unpopular. Dana Perino: And she's brave. Greg Gutfeld: Yeah. Juan Williams: Yes. She is. Katie Pavlich: I told you. Greg Gutfeld: Mine is obvious. I don't like this time of the season. Don't like it. Dana Perino: But wait. Can we go back. Greg Gutfeld: What? Dana Perino: Why is it beneficial? Katie Pavlich: To certain populations in Africa? Dana Perino: Yeah. Katie Pavlich: Because it sustains a lot of the local populations with not only food, but jobs, and an economy, and I could go on and on. But -- Jesse Watters: It's about sustainable, Dana. Katie Pavlich: -- if you ask the people who live there, who are hunting guides and that kind of thing, they will say, ""We actually like this kind of thing and Westerner should probably stay out of it.” Dana Perino: Well, I've got to read up on that. Katie Pavlich: I'll send you some pieces. Greg Gutfeld: Fun Christmas topic. Dana Perino: Yeah. [LAUGHS] Greg Gutfeld: Killing animals. Katie Pavlich: Sorry. Juan Williams: [LAUGHS] Greg Gutfeld: All right. Tom asks -- Jesse Watters: Sorry, Rudolph. Juan Williams: Wait, wait, wait. We can have a new segment. Greg Gutfeld: Yeah. Animals are tasty. Juan Williams: Animals were great. Greg Gutfeld: Yeah. [LAUGHTER] Katie Pavlich: They are yummy. I bet people are eating them today. Dana Perino: Yeah, animals were great tasting. Greg Gutfeld: Yes. In your dream house, what is one weird room -- this is a scary question -- feature you would include in your dream house? What would it be? Get it over with, Jesse. Jesse Watters: How did you know I was chomping at the bit? Greg Gutfeld: [LAUGHS] Yeah. Jesse Watters: No, I've always -- Greg Gutfeld: Guess what the room is? Jesse Watters: -- wanted -- Greg Gutfeld: You're basically tied up. [LAUGHTER] Jesse Watters: We have a safe word. [LAUGHTER] No. I want like a spa in the house with steam or a sauna and then an ice plunge -- Juan Williams: Wow. Dana Perino: You'd do the ice plunge? Jesse Watters: Yeah, definitely. Dana Perino: I would never do an ice plunge. Greg Gutfeld: All right. Dream house. One weird rumor feature. Katie Pavlich: One weird room or feature? I like the movie theater in the house. I think that's really cool. Greg Gutfeld: That's not weird though, that's -- you'll be able to do that in a few years. Katie Pavlich: I mean, weird. Greg Gutfeld: [LAUGHS] Jesse Watters: Keep your head down, and keep working hard, Katie. Greg Gutfeld: Yeah, stay late. Katie Pavlich: Don't talk about we just talked about. Greg Gutfeld: Dana. Dana Perino: I would like a room that was dedicated to all the Pilates apparati [sic]-- Greg Gutfeld: Oh. Dana Perino: Is that the plural? Apparati? Greg Gutfeld: It might be. Pilates apparati. Dana Perino: Apparati. Greg Gutfeld: That sounds like the name of a dancer I knew. [LAUGHTER] Dana Perino: What was his last name? Greg Gutfeld: Dana. [LAUGHTER] Juan Williams: Go, Dana. Jesse Watters: Roasted like a Christmas goose. Greg Gutfeld: Yes. All right. Juan? Juan Williams: A cafeteria. Greg Gutfeld: Oh. Jesse Watters: In your house? Juan Williams: Wouldn't that be cool, Jesse? Greg Gutfeld: No. You -- okay. When I was young, I wanted my own fast food restaurant in my house. Juan Williams: [LAUGHS] There you go. Greg Gutfeld: That was my rich fantasy. There was going to be Jack in the Box, which could be the first floor. You can come home and order anything off the menu. [LAUGHTER] Juan Williams: Yeah, really. Greg Gutfeld: But then you realize as you get older that you can't do that because you be dead by thirty. Katie Pavlich: True. Juan Williams: So rich people, though, I noticed oftentimes they have gyms in their house. Greg Gutfeld: Yeah. Juan Williams: Like they have a basketball court right there. Dana Perino: That'd be nice. Juan Williams: Right. What -- Jesse Watters: You're rich, Juan. Juan Williams: I'm not that rich. [LAUGHS] I don't know. Jesse Watters: Juan, I think you can afford a court. Come on. Juan Williams: In my house? Jesse Watters: Juan, you've been on The Five for 15 years. Juan Williams: [LAUGHS] Man, give me a break. Greg Gutfeld: And that's even 7 years longer than The Five has been around. [LAUGHTER] I want a moat, but I want an indoor moat. Like I want to be able to swim around my house. So it's about this wide -- Dana Perino: Like a lazy river? [LAUGHTER] Greg Gutfeld: Yeah, I want a lazy river in my house. So I can just swim -- now, I live in an apartment, but it would be great just to be swimming around the house. Like, oh -- Dana Perino: Stock of wine. Greg Gutfeld: -- have little cocktails, have a bar, a swim up bar like they -- Dana Perino: Kind of cool. Greg Gutfeld: -- have at those all-inclusive resorts. Jesse Watters: Jack in the Box. Robins. Juan Williams: How do you -- Greg Gutfeld: Just swim around. I would never leave home. Juan Williams: Living -- Katie Pavlich: The animals in the -- Juan Williams: There is a house like this. You know that? Greg Gutfeld: What's that? Juan Williams: In Wisconsin with the -- the river goes through the house. Jesse Watters: It's called Neverland, Juan. We don't like to talk about it. Greg Gutfeld: All right. They're yelling at me. What's the last song played on your phone? The answer when we come back. [COMMERCIAL BREAK] Katie Pavlich: Welcome back. Greg hates that song as well. We are answering your questions on our Christmas fan mail special. So this question comes from Instagram from John Gone 24 [spelled phonetically] If you looked up your iPod to the studio speakers right now, what song is playing? Greg, A, do you have an iPod, and, B, which song was playing? [LAUGHS] Greg Gutfeld: I do have an iPod. I'm the only one -- probably only person left on the planet that has an actual iPod. Katie Pavlich: Part of your -- Greg Gutfeld: I like it separate from my phone. Moon Diagrams, some strange band. Pretty good. Katie Pavlich: Okay. Greg Gutfeld: One album. It's called Moon Diagrams.

Katie Pavlich: I'm not going to sing another song. Dana Perino: She draws the line. Katie Pavlich: Yeah, I'm drawing the line, but only Spanish songs are what I sing because we sound a little better. You don't have to worry about your accent. All right. Next question. What photo is on your cell phone background? Jesse? Jesse Watters: I have a beach background, some waves. Katie Pavlich: Oh, nice. Dana Perino: He's got the one that comes with the phone. [LAUGHTER] Jesse Watters: Is that the default? I have the default. Katie Pavlich: Dana. Dana Perino: I have a picture of Jasper and me at a party in the summer. Katie Pavlich: Okay, nice. Greg Gutfeld: I have nothing. Nothing. Katie Pavlich: You're default too? Jesse Watters: You have default? Greg Gutfeld: Yeah. Jesse Watters: Yeah. Buddy. Greg Gutfeld: I don't even know you could do it. That's good news to me. Katie Pavlich: Want me to show you? Greg Gutfeld: No, I'm good. Katie Pavlich: You can do a wallpaper or a photo. Juan? Juan Williams: I think it's wallpaper. I don't think I have one. Katie Pavlich: So is this a woman thing, Dana? Dana Perino: I mean -- Katie Pavlich: I have a picture. Dana Perino: Obviously, it's people who know how to use their iPhones. Juan Williams: The smart people. Katie Pavlich: Want me to help you? Dana Perino: I'm doing this -- Jesse Watters: Oh, no, I don't want Jaspar on my phone. Katie Pavlich: Both pictures of my husband and my dog. Greg Gutfeld: That's what it'll be. You won't able to get it off. Juan Williams: I like -- fix it. Katie Pavlich: You should choose one. It's kind of fun. I'm not going to choose one for you. Jesse Watters: Okay.

Dana Perino: A [unintelligible] leather boot? Greg Gutfeld: [LAUGHS] Yes. Katie Pavlich: It's true. Greg Gutfeld: Yes. Katie Pavlich: Yeah. Jesse Watters: I think everyone needs a nice pair of shoes. Men especially because women, the first thing they look at is your feet, and they judge you on the shoes you wear. Katie Pavlich: I don't think that’s true -- Jesse Watters: I've read this thousands of times. [cross talk] Greg Gutfeld: You are like -- you're a font of conventional wisdom. [LAUGHTER] I know what I've heard it from you I've already heard it. [LAUGHTER] Jesse Watters: There's more where came from. [cross talk] Katie Pavlich: Juan, what do you think I should have? One item. Juan Williams: I didn't know. I was thinking like a nice suit in case you got to go someplace. I don't know. Katie Pavlich: I would say a life straw. Jesse Watters: A what? Katie Pavlich: It filters out your water in case the water's bad. Jesse Watters: Oh. Katie Pavlich: A life straw. Juan Williams: I never heard of that. Katie Pavlich: Yeah it's a survival skill. Juan Williams: You know what? Katie Pavlich: You can buy them on Amazon. Juan Williams: It's not a skill, it's an item. Katie Pavlich: Well, true, but it's a skill to buy one. Yeah. Life straw. Let's see. Number four, Instagram question from Barnes Gibby [spelled phonetically], what is your least favorite mode of transportation? Mine's a bus because there's no bathroom on a bus. Greg Gutfeld: I don't like being carried. [LAUGHTER] Katie Pavlich: You don't like being carried. Jesse Watters: Not what I heard, Greg. [LAUGHS] I've been carrying you the whole show. [LAUGHS] I don't like rickshaws. They rip you off, and they take forever. Dana Perino: Yeah. Jesse Watters: It's like such a scam. Greg Gutfeld: Jesse, they're called petty cabs. Dana Perino: [LAUGHS] A rickshaw? Greg Gutfeld: They're called petty cabs. Jesse Watters: So what's the difference? Dana Perino: Yeah, there's a difference. Jesse Watters: Where does a rickshaw -- Dana Perino: I'm going to say a slow train. Katie Pavlich: A slow train. Dana Perino: I hate a slow train. I like a fast train. Katie Pavlich: Juan, you're least favorite? Juan Williams: Boats. I don't like boats. Katie Pavlich: Yeah. Greg Gutfeld: I hate boats. Dana Perino: I like a fairy. Greg Gutfeld: I don't like boats. Juan Williams: You don't like them? Greg Gutfeld: No, I don't like the ground moving underneath me. It makes me sick. Juan Williams: No, it's not cool. Not cool. Katie Pavlich: You don't like a cruise ship to take you? Greg Gutfeld: No, I'll get sea sickness in the slightest -- well, of course I would. [LAUGHS] Katie Pavlich: All right. One more question. Right? One more? Okay. Instagram question from Cesar [spelled phonetically] When was the last time you got to tell someone I told you so? Dana Perino: Oh, last hour. Katie Pavlich: Okay. Greg. Jesse Watters: I mean I can't wait to talk about this FISA stuff with Juan. Juan Williams: Whoa -- Jesse Watters: You mean -- Juan Williams: That's the way I feel-- Jesse Watters: Earlier. Juan Williams: That's the way I felt you know, but, you know, there's so much of this, but I don't want to be political. So I'm going leave that alone for the moment. But told you so would be like, you know, out with my kids, and they're eating something, and I said, ""I told you that was nasty."" You know, ""Don't eat it.” Katie Pavlich: [LAUGHS] Greg. Jesse Watters: Yep, I've had that. Greg Gutfeld: I never say because I can never remember what I've said. Jesse Watters: [LAUGHS] Katie Pavlich: Okay. All right. One more question from one more viewer up next. [COMMERCIAL BREAK] Juan Williams: This show has been an instant Christmas classic, so welcome back. It's time for one last Christmas question. What do you eat for Christmas dinner, Katie? Katie Pavlich: Sometimes moose or elk? Jesse Watters: Wow. Katie Pavlich: Yeah. Juan Williams: Really? Jesse Watters: Moose is the plural of mice. Katie Pavlich: No, it's not. [LAUGHTER] We learned this. No, it's not. Juan Williams: All right, Jesse? Jesse Watters: Ribeye or eye of the round. Juan Williams: Yeah. Yeah. Jesse Watters: Yes. Juan Williams: You cook? Jesse Watters: I did not cook it. Juan Williams: You do not cook it. All right. Your mom? Jesse Watters: My mother does. Juan Williams: Merry Christmas, Mrs. Watters. Jesse Watters: Merry Christmas from Texas. Juan Williams: Yeah, really? Dana Perino: Whatever is available because I usually am invited to go somewhere. [LAUGHS] But ham, usually, ham I think. Maybe steak. Oh, I don't know. Jesse Watters: Like a honey backed ham? Dana Perino: Also, really, truly is just I'm really there for the wine. Katie Pavlich: Yeah. [LAUGHTER] Dana Perino: Which is great by that time. Juan Williams: Greg? Greg Gutfeld: I wonder do they sell those Honey baked ham stores? Dana Perino: Yes. I just ordered one for as a gift for somebody that will arrive -- Greg Gutfeld: Yesterday. Dana Perino: Yes. Greg Gutfeld: I would probably do the -- I always have steak. Jesse Watters: Yes. Greg Gutfeld: Because I generally I'm eating at a restaurant at Christmas time, and it's the best way to do Christmas because, no, you don't have to do dishes. Jesse Watters: No clean up. Greg Gutfeld: You have the people around you-- Dana Perino: Leave a big tip. Greg Gutfeld: You leave a big tip. Jesse Watters: Well, depends on the service. Greg Gutfeld: Yeah, of course. [LAUGHTER] Oh, not this again. [LAUGHTER] Juan Williams: So I like ham, but I don't eat that much meat. But at Christmas time, there are two types of hams. There's a honey-baked ham that you talked about, but there's also a salted ham. Jesse Watters: Oh, I don't like the salted ham. Juan Williams: Yes, it's different. But, you know -- Jesse Watters: Too salty. Greg Gutfeld: It's too briny. Juan Williams: My brother-in-law is like a doctor and you watch him cut it. Greg Gutfeld: Like a doctor? Juan Williams: Well, he is a doctor. [LAUGHTER] [CROSSTALK] Juan Williams: Yeah, I don't want -- Greg Gutfeld: That would be a great business card. ""Like a doctor."" Juan Williams: It is. But to watch him carve up that ham, you know, it's a big deal. Anyway, we had time for one last question. And of course, I mean, this may be the question of questions. Katie Pavlich: Oh, no. Juan Williams: The hardest person in your life to buy a gift for. Katie Pavlich: Oh, my dad. Juan Williams: Because? Katie Pavlich: He has everything. He has everything. Jesse Watters: Sophia, my one daughter. Yeah, she's impossible. Juan Williams: Because? Jesse Watters: Impossible. Well, the other Ellie is easy because it's so easy. But Sofia is impossible. Juan Williams: Dana? Dana Perino: I'm going to say my dad, too. Katie Pavlich: Yeah. Dana Perino: Yep. Female Speaker: Dads are hard. Juan Williams: Greg? Greg Gutfeld: Clooney. Every time -- every year, I get something and then it's like he's super polite about it, but I know -- Jesse Watters: He has it. Greg Gutfeld: He has it. So then it's like then I -- and I never see him use it, so -- Juan Williams: Oh, boy. Katie Pavlich: Get a gift receipt. Juan Williams: All right. Thanks for spending some of your holiday with us. We're going to see you back here tomorrow. Merry Christmas to everyone and to all, good night. Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

118,FOX,"Jesse Watters and Emily Compagno find a Christmas tree for 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" December 24, 2019. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Dana Perino, co-host: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino, along with Emily Campagno, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City. This is ""The Five."" Merry Christmas Eve, everyone. We're excited to have you join us for our celebration. We have tons of fun for you tonight, including reaction to our first ever Christmas grab bag of stories making headlines, a special Christmas edition of Supermarket Showdown. And, we are squaring off to see who will be crowned The Quiz Show champion. Plus, we've been waiting all year for our Secret Santa gift exchange. It's our biggest one yet. Don't miss the annual tradition. But first, there's no better way to get into the Christmas spirit than by cutting down your own Christmas tree. So Jesse and Emily went out on a little adventure to a local tree farm to show us how it's done. Take a look. [BEGIN VIDEO CLIP] Jesse Watters, co-host: We're here at the Hidden Pond Christmas Tree Farm in Mendham, New Jersey, with Christian Nicholson, the owner. Emily Compagno, guest co-host: I have to say, Christian, I'm so excited. I have never cut down a Christmas tree before. This is like a life-long dream of mine. Christian Nicholson: Well, what you're going to realize when you get done is it's not so much about the tree, it's about the memories and about the spirit of Christmas when you come out to a real Christmas tree farm. So we're going to take a drive out to the fields, and take a look at some of the trees. Jesse, we'd like you to drive the tractor. Do you know how to drive a stick shift? [LAUGHTER] Emily, how about you? Do you know how to drive a stick shift? Emily Compagno: Yes, I do. All Mack Truck [spelled phonetically]. Christian Nicholson: Should have known. Jesse Watters: Try to keep it under the speed limit. Emily Compagno: [LAUGHS] Christian Nicholson: That's a really nice tree right there. Jesse Watters: What do you think the perfect tree would look like for The Five? Emily Compagno: Obviously, as big as possible that can fit in that space. Jesse Watters: So this is maybe around 5-4. This is like Gutfeld size. [LAUGHTER] Emily Compagno: Where's Dana? Jesse Watters: He needs a few more years. Emily Compagno: That's Dana. Jesse Watters: That's Dana Perino. Emily Compagno: This one is leaning a little to the left. Jesse Watters: That's Juan. [LAUGHTER] Jesse Watters: Some of these, actually, they're getting good if we keep walking. These are some big ones back here. Emily Compagno: I feel like we're in an orphanage and all the kids are like, ""Pick me, pick me."" Like all the trees are like, ""Pick me, pick me."" Christian Nicholson: You looking to adopt? Emily Compagno: Sounds horrible. Jesse Watters: Whoa-ho. Ho-ho. Emily Compagno: Ooh. Jesse Watters: This is nice. Oh, this is a taker. Emily Compagno: Ooh, how about this one? Wait, it's a little crooked. Jesse Watters: It's like Hillary. [LAUGHTER] Emily Compagno: Otherwise I think it's perfect. Jesse Watters: I like it. I think it's got good size. It's got nice shape. Emily Compagno: Great density. Jesse Watters: Nice density. Emily Compagno: Great height. Jesse Watters: Perfect tip. Should I saw it down? Emily Compagno: Oh, I'm kind of impressed, actually. Jesse Watters: Timber. Emily Compagno: Oh, God. [LAUGHTER] Jesse Watters: Frazier fir. Emily Compagno: Ho-ho-ho! Jesse Watters: All right, let's go bag it and tag it. Emily Compagno: All right, I'm ready. Jesse Watters: All right, here it comes. Emily Compagno: Okay. Don't shove it in my face. Oh, great. That's so easy. Jesse Watters: All right, Emily. We came, we sawed, and we conquered. Emily Compagno: All right. Merry Christmas, Jesse. Jesse Watters: Merry Christmas. Let's throw it back to the car and ride it to ""The Five."" Here we go. All right. In the elevator. Emily Compagno: You're almost home, buddy. Jesse Watters: Ah, you have the lights on. Emily Compagno: All right. Yay. Jesse Watters: Although got to decorate it. Producers? Let's go. Dana Perino: Well done, guys. Not the first time you ever did that? Jesse Watters: No, I've done it many times. That's why I sawed it so fast. Emily Compagno: Oh, exactly. Greg Gutfeld, co-host: Wait, how come she was driving the ATV and not you? Jesse Watters: As we saw, I don't drive stick. Greg Gutfeld: You don't drive stick? Jesse Watters: Never learned. Never learned. Emily Compagno: It was a tractor, which I drove and hauling the flatbed with people on it, a bunch of people and the tree, it was awesome. That tree farm was incredible. It was my first time. Jesse Watters: How did you -- how did you feel killing a living thing? Emily Compagno: I felt bad. That's why I thanked the tree stump after. Greg Gutfeld: Oh, did you? Jesse Watters: We all -- no, we planted some seeds to, you know, replenish. Dana Perino: Oh, really? Jesse Watters: -- the farm. Yes. Dana Perino: That's part of your -- Jesse Watters: We did plant seeds. Juan Williams, co-host: All right, let me just say -- Jesse Watters: I think we did. Juan Williams: I've done this a lot. Jesse Watters: Yeah. Juan Williams: But the thing is, you get the tree back, and there's still bugs in the tree. Greg Gutfeld: Ugh. Jesse Watters: One time my parents sawed it off in Pennsylvania, brought it all the way to Long Island, and then that night they heard my cat screaming, and they found out a squirrel had embedded itself in the tree. It escaped in the middle of the night. Emily Compagno: Oh, my -- Juan Williams: The other thing that I love about this is, when you put it in that plastic wrapping thing because, you know, initially, they -- like when they -- sometimes they do a fresh cut so that when you get it home, the tree can still absorb water. Jesse Watters: Right. Juan Williams: But what they do right at the end is they stick it in this plastic thing, and it reminds me of a wood chipper. Jesse Watters: Yeah. Juan Williams: You know? Jesse Watters: I know. Juan Williams: What if they put me in there? Oh, my God. Jesse Watters: I know, I know. Juan Williams: I wouldn't never get out. Jesse Watters: A lot of people might want to, Juan. [LAUGHTER] Emily Compagno: That might be a good -- that might be a handy thing to have. Greg Gutfeld: What? Emily Compagno: One of those net things. Greg Gutfeld: Yeah, the wrapping, the wrapping tube. They should apply that to other things. Like imagine just putting anything in that tube, and it comes out all wrapped up like your gym stuff. Like you're going to the gym, you just throw all your crap, and it goes ""whoop splokkk"" into this like little kind of mesh thing. Juan Williams: Well, then what it reminds me of the most is at the airports now, they have luggage things that are like that. Greg Gutfeld: Yeah. Juan Williams: Right? Dana Perino: Yes, they do. Juan Williams: I think if you're going overseas -- Dana Perino: They do. Emily Compagno: Vacuum sealers. Dana Perino: Well, that was really super cute. Thanks for going out there to do that. We have another one -- Greg Gutfeld: Super cute, Dana? Dana Perino: Yeah, it was super cute. So it just wouldn't feel like Christmas in New York City without indulging in some delicious deserts. There -- two people here at this table went with me to Serendipity. They have really big sweet tooths, all right? Unforgettable tasty treats. Watch. [BEGIN VIDEO CLIP] Dana Perino: Hi, everyone. We are at one of the best place that's New York City has to offer. There's especially no place better to be than on the holidays. We're at Serendipity, which is a famous place. And we have Chef Joe who -- [Chef Joe] Hello. Dana Perino: -- is going to show us and tell us a bit about these iconic desserts. [Chef Joe] Well, here we have the Outrageous Banana Split. And if that intimidates you -- Dana Perino: Yeah. [Chef Joe] -- we have the Coward's Portion right next to it. Dana Perino: Well, I'll give it a shot. [Chef Joe] Yeah. Enjoy. Emily Compagno: I've never had a proper banana split in my life. Dana Perino: What? [Chef Joe] Oh, no. Emily Compagno: No, never. [Chef Joe] Well, when my wife was pregnant, she not only wanted ice cream, she wanted chocolate fudge cake. Dana Perino: So you would go to the store and get it? [Chef Joe] I'm still married. Dana Perino: Do you have a favorite dessert for Christmas, Juan? Juan Williams: Well, my wife makes a banana cream pie that's to die for. Dana Perino: My grandmother on my mother's side would make an apple pie, like this dessert, and there would be a cherry pie usually. But I'll definitely do something chocolate. Juan Williams: You know what? That cinnamon ice cream is out of this world. Dana Perino: It is. What if you -- what if you put cinnamon in your chocolate, Juan? Juan Williams: [LAUGHS] Geez, that sounds a little looped [spelled phonetically]. Emily Compagno: What is this, like the -- [Chef Joe] It's pecan pie, butter pecan ice cream, wet walnuts topped with hot fudge, whipped cream, and almonds. Dana Perino: Who comes up with these things? [Chef Joe] We all do. Dana Perino: Okay. [Chef Joe] And I do. Emily Compagno: Say no more, Joe. Dana Perino: All right, thank you. [Chef Joe] Enjoy, enjoy. Dana Perino: Thanks, Joe. [Chef Joe] Dig in. Dana Perino: Ugh! Well -- sorry, making a mess at Serendipity. Juan Williams: This is the kind of chocolate cake I like. It's nice, moist. It looks so beautiful. Emily Compagno: Did you guys have a bite of this cake? Dana Perino: I did have a -- Emily Compagno: If you guys could have any dessert every day for the rest of your life, what would you have? Juan Williams: If I was on death row, I think I'd take this Broadway. Dana Perino: Really? Juan Williams: It's pretty good. Dana Perino: You want the ice cream and the cheesecake at the same time? Juan Williams: You know I'm going to be a fat man. You're going to make fun of me. Dana Perino: No. You have the best -- you have the best metabolism of anybody. [Chef Joe] It's the Frozen Hot Chocolate. That's our iconic drink topped with a mountain of whipped cream, shaved chocolate. Dana Perino: Thank you. [Chef Joe] Enjoy. Dana Perino: All right. Okay, you're going to love this the most out of all of them. Watch. Juan Williams: Oh, my God. Dana Perino: [LAUGHS] [END VIDEO CLIP] Jesse Watters: You know what I noticed? Greg wasn't in any of those. Where were you? Greg Gutfeld: I was busy. I'm not a big fan of watching people eat. Sorry. It's like kind of grosses me out. It's like you know in movies, whenever they have scenes -- or it's usually like they're -- people go to lunch, and they're all talking when they're eating, it's like, ""You don't need that. Just don't have -- Jesse Watters: Well, they tell politicians, ""Never eat on camera."" Greg Gutfeld: Yes, exactly. Although you all did a good job eating on camera. Nothing was dripping down. Emily Compagno: No, we did a good job. Jesse Watters: Do you appreciate that constructive criticism? Dana Perino: Yeah. Appreciated that. I mean, it is an amazing place, Serendipity. And they actually have their own line of ice cream, and they gave us some here. I got the Outrageous Banana Split. You can get these in lots of stores. Jesse Watters: So, Juan, I have the one you liked, the Forbidden Broadway Sundae. Juan Williams: Man, let me tell you something, it's awesome. Jesse Watters: You want to switch? Juan Williams: Awesome. But this isn't bad, Salty Carmel Pretzel -- Jesse Watters: Oh, I like that. I'll switch -- Juan Williams: You know what they say about the American diet? Salt and sugar. Jesse Watters: That's it. Juan Williams: That's all you need. Dana Perino: But every time -- everything they -- everything they said that day, Juan would say, ""Oh, that's my favorite."" ""Oh, no, that's my favorite."" Juan Williams: I'm a -- I'm an ice cream guy. I love it. Jesse Watters: And, you know, Juan, the best part, zero calories. Juan Williams: Is that right? [LAUGHTER] Check your eyeballs. Emily Compagno: I thought that was such a wonderful place. It was so special. I've heard about it for so long, right? The movie ""Serendipity"" was filmed, all about it and it was great. And on the walk home, I was literally, like, it was like being drunk off sugar but, and high at the same -- my heart was beating, like, so fast and I had to breathe through it because I had so much -- Dana Perino: It makes you realize what children feel like, right? Emily Compagno: Yeah [LAUGHS]. Dana Perino: When they have, like, a sugar high? Emily Compagno: Yeah, exactly. Greg Gutfeld: Like diabetics. [CROSSTALK] Emily Compagno: It was crazy. Juan Williams: You know, you've heard of, you've heard of ""Breakfast,"" -- Emily Compagno: Forfeit [spelled phonetically]. Juan Williams: -- ""at Tiffany's?"" Emily Compagno: Yes. Juan Williams: But I think ""Dessert at Serendipity"" -- Jesse Watters: Oh. Juan Williams: -- is pretty cool for Christmas, let me tell you, because it's -- [CROSSTALK] -- like a child's wonderland, but except I don't see, we didn't see many kids in there because the adults are all -- and they have -- Dana Perino: The frozen hot chocolate -- Juan Williams: -- it costs -- Dana Perino: -- you can buy in a powder and I sent some up to the ranch for this Christmas -- Juan Williams: Oh, did you? Dana Perino: -- for my little cousins. Juan Williams: Oh. Emily Compagno: Nice. Dana Perino: Have a good time. We are all set? Everybody good? Jesse Watters: Yeah, me and some ice cream. [CROSSTALK] Dana Perino: We have more to come? [CROSSTALK] All right, eat up. Coming up, our amazing Secret Santa reveal that you do not want to miss. I am very excited about this one. But first, we're weighing in on some festive topics in Christmas grab bag with Emily when The Five returns. [music playing] [COMMERCIAL BREAK] Emily Compagno: Welcome back. It's time now for our Christmas grab bag of holiday topics. First up, mall Santas beware: Video chat companies are now offering families the chance for their kids to virtually chat with Old Saint Nick from the comfort of home. Juan, do you think, what do you think about this? Do you think it should replace the experience? I took Duchess [spelled phonetically] to take a photo with a sleigh this week at a mall and it was wonderful. Juan Williams: I agree. So, I don't know, people who watch this show know I just recently showed pictures of my grandkids at the mall with the Santa. And in fact, it was funny because the Santa remembered them from the year before. Dana Perino: Cute. Juan Williams: But I think the objection here -- Dana Perino: Did it work [spelled phonetically]? Juan Williams: -- and this goes way back in my family life -- is you have to stand in line if you go to the mall Santa, and sometimes the line can be, like, inexorable. Like just the line goes on, and on, and on, and on. But it's all part of the family tradition. It's like, ""Yeah, we go through this."" It's like going to the Thanksgiving Day parade here in New York where there's these big crowds and it's sometimes cold and windy, and even icy or snowy. But you're standing there, and then the floats come, and memories are made. So, I think the comfort of home, maybe for a disabled child, I get it. But beyond that, this is laziness. Emily Compagno: Oh. Jesse Watters: A friend of mine in his 30s just decided to make a little extra cash for the holiday season and became a mall Santa and just sat there, had kids sit in his lap, and collected a lot of cash for the holiday season. So, if you're looking for a little side hustle around this time of year, it's a great opportunity. Dana Perino: I like it that Santa is not afraid of technology and just rolls with the times, like not afraid to get on the video chat -- Emily Compagno: Yeah. Dana Perino: -- Skype it up. Emily Compagno: Yeah, totally. Dana Perino: I'm for that. Greg Gutfeld: Well, you know I don't like children. So, if I were -- this would be the way I would do it if I were Santa. I was a shopping mall Santa -- Jesse Watters: Were you? [CROSSTALK] Greg Gutfeld: -- in Cherry Hill at the, at the mall in Cherry Hill. Jesse Watters: New Jersey? Greg Gutfeld: Yes. Yeah. Emily Compagno: Wait, how could you -- Jesse Watters: That's a good one. Wait. Emily Compagno: -- but you hate Christmas. Greg Gutfeld: I did it for Good Morning America. [LAUGHTER] Jesse Watters: Oh. Greg Gutfeld: I went to, I went to Santa school and became -- Jesse Watters: But -- Greg Gutfeld: -- a Santa there and I was reprimanded for drinking because during -- [LAUGHTER] Greg Gutfeld: -- we were -- Jesse Watters: -- wait. Greg Gutfeld: -- we were filming. Emily Compagno: I feel like this is -- Greg Gutfeld: We were filming and I thought like, ""Okay, I'll take a break and go to lunch."" So, I went to the -- they have great restaurants in Cherry Hill that, wherever that place is -- and I had pizza with two, maybe three glasses of wine. And when I got back -- [LAUGHTER] Greg Gutfeld: -- and these are real honest to God Santas with the real beards. Emily Compagno: Oh my god. Greg Gutfeld: They're like, they don't take it, they don't treat it lightly. And they could smell it and they were like, ""You can't do this."" Jesse Watters: You were in character, Greg. That's what Santa does. Greg Gutfeld: Yeah. Jesse Watters: Takes a little nip. Emily Compagno: [LAUGHS] Greg Gutfeld: No. No, no. They will, they will -- the alcohol thing, they will not, they will -- Juan Williams: Are you sure this isn't that movie ""Bad Santa?"" Emily Compagno: Yeah, I was just -- [CROSSTALK] Emily Compagno: Sounds like ""Bad Santa."" Greg Gutfeld: It actually had, it actually ran on Good Morning America, like, almost 20 years ago. Jesse Watters: All right. Someone pull that clip. Emily Compagno: Amazing. Dana Perino: Yeah, totally. Emily Compagno: All right. Up next, we all look forward to doing Secret Santa here on The Five. But apparently, not everyone is a fan of the Christmas tradition. Some millennials say that they want to ban the gift exchange because it triggers anxiety for them at work. Greg, to you first. Greg Gutfeld: It is -- well, what doesn't trigger anxiety for me? [LAUGHTER] Put this in a long line of things. I don't like it because it's just like you have to figure out how much to spend without offending somebody. And frankly, that's what assistants are for. Emily Compagno: Oh my gosh. [LAUGHTER] Dana Perino: I like it because I love coming up with ideas for people for gifts. Emily Compagno: Yes. Dana Perino: Yeah, I like it. Emily Compagno: Jesse. Jesse Watters: Yeah. And you put a limit on it so people like Greg, who make tons and tons of money, don't feel uncomfortable. [LAUGHTER] Emily Compagno: Juan, what do you think? Juan Williams: Well, I guess if -- there is some anxiety. It's like in New York you have to give money to the doormen or to the people around -- Dana Perino: They deserve it. Greg Gutfeld: The garbage man. Juan Williams: No, no -- or the garbage. That's everybody, that's in every town. Greg Gutfeld: Yes. Juan Williams: But yeah, Dana, they do deserve it, but it feels like, ""Well, exactly how much am I supposed to give?"" It's like a tip, you know. A tip in a restaurant, you know, 20 percent, whatever, right? But now, with this, it's like hmm. But now, I don't mind at work, it's just, to me, an acceptable part -- and people say anxiety -- I think it's part of life. Greg Gutfeld: No, it's not. Juan Williams: No? Emily Compagno: [LAUGHS] Greg Gutfeld: No, it shouldn't be part of life at all. We should not be doing this. We should not have other customs foisted upon us. We should say, ""No."" Juan Williams: But what about being part of the group, Greg? Jesse Watters: He doesn't want that. [CROSSTALK] Emily Compagno: [LAUGHS] Jesse Watters: He doesn't want that. And you know what, the group doesn't want it either. [LAUGHTER] Greg Gutfeld: It's true. Emily Compagno: The little bah humbug. All right, up next: A surprising trend under the tree this year. Many people are using Christmas gifts to send passive-aggressive messages. Some of the top so-called ""take the hint"" presents include deodorant or cologne, gym memberships, and self-help books. Dana Perino: [LAUGHS] Emily Compagno: This kind of goes with the Peloton -- Peloton? Jesse Watters: Peloton. [LAUGHTER] Greg Gutfeld: It's guillotine. [LAUGHTER] Emily Compagno: Whatever. Kind of -- you know what, going -- it kind of goes with that, right? What would you do if you woke up and had, like, that, one of those gifts -- Juan Williams: If I -- Emily Compagno: -- under the tree? Juan Williams: -- oh, one of those? Emily Compagno: Yeah. Juan Williams: Well, I would take it as a passive-aggressive act if someone gave you deodorant [LAUGHS]. So that if someone gave you deodorant what are they trying to tell you right. I mean but the other I noticed they also had mouthwash and toothbrushes. Jesse Watters: Who does that? Juan Williams: Right. Emily Compagno: That sounds terrible that's a little. Jesse Watters: My parents my whole life gave me floss, toothbrush and Listerine. Greg Gutfeld: Oh it was like, you went to the dentist, when they give you the little pack. Jesse Watters: That's right. Juan Williams: That was Christmas day. Jesse Watters: I think that was I think they were telling me something. Emily Compagno: Oh, gosh Dana. Dana Perino: I don't like this idea at all. Nope only if they've asked for some like a cologne, I think, or perfume usually that's something because somebody has something that they would like and you should get that for them but don't do this. Emily Compagno: Yeah. Greg Gutfeld: I think that it depends on what you're trying to get them to do. To become a smarter, more well-rounded person purchasing my book, the Gutfeld Monologues, putting it in a stocking would be quite good. But like, yeah, I think it's wrong to give people any overt, you know, hints about their hygiene. Emily Compagno: Yeah. Greg Gutfeld: You know, Emily. Emily Compagno: All right up next, the principal of an elementary school in England under fire for banning students from sending each other Christmas cards because of environmental concerns. Instead, he suggests one card be sent to the entire class to help save the planet. Juan yes or no? Juan Williams: Sure I don't you know I can see why we're doing this is because everybody in America, at least in my family, we send Christmas cards. We love it right. But I think that this is an effort that's partly educational to say to people, we should need to be aware of how, in fact, we contribute to global warming and I'm all for that. I think people should be aware it's not any. Greg Gutfeld: You just put a plot in cutting down a tree. Juan Williams: Yeah, but that's in fact, that was a Christmas tree farm it built and grown for that purpose... Greg Gutfeld: More like a camp for living trees. Juan Williams: Is that right. Jesse Watters: And we're going to use it to make paper. Emily Compagno: I get much I get fewer Christmas cards now than I have in years past. I think people have gone to their electronic versions. I don't have a problem of that. Juan Williams: By the way, you know what I got I get all the time now is paperless, invitations that come in the e-mail. Dana Perino: Wow you're a popular guy. Juan Williams: Well I but you know what you know what, Dana, I'm also an old guy, so I'm always like when they don't open this thing. Jesse Watters: Did you get the White House Christmas card? It's this big it's huge. Female Speaker: Really. Greg Gutfeld: Talk about a humble brag. Hey um did you guys get the White House Christmas card. Oh, no, oh well I you wouldn't like it it's so big and the handwriting is just so it's so hard to read Donald's handwriting, Don. I mean, the president I call Don when we're alone. You are so blatant. Jesse Watters: It just came up in conversation. Juan Williams: You know what that's a passive aggressive. It's like deodorant as a Christmas gift. Greg Gutfeld: Yes that was good. Emily Compagno: All right you guys don't go anywhere our Secret Santa gift exchange is coming up but first, we're going to face off in a Christmas edition of Supermarket Showdown. Stay with us. [COMMERCIAL BREAK] Jesse Watters: Greg you're so just in the mood I can. Greg Gutfeld: No I just hate Christmas. Jesse Watters: I can feel it. Greg Gutfeld: We know this already.

Jesse Watters: You do love to shop, Emily. That is true. Juan Williams: Go. Emily Compagno: -- over every single one. This is amazing. Juan Williams: What about actual value? Jesse Watters: I was actually closest for the record. I was just over. Juan Williams: What about actual value? Emily Compagno: But it doesn't matter. Greg Gutfeld: No, just like ratings, it's twice as costly as CNN. [LAUGHTER] Jesse Watters: All right. Baby shark puppet. What is the baby shark puppet, by the way? Do we know what that is? Greg Gutfeld: No idea. And it's -- people with kids know this. Juan Williams: What are you -- how can you not know what the baby shark is? Emily Compagno: Like an actual puppet? Jesse Watters: All right. Emily Compagno: Is it an actual puppet or just a stuffed animal? Jesse Watters: Can someone sing the song for us just to get us in the mood? Juan Williams: Baby shark. Greg Gutfeld: There you go. Jesse Watters: Juan, you've got to keep going. All right, everybody, prices up. Juan Williams: Oh, I don't know. Let me see here.

Jesse Watters: Emily has it again. Emily Compagno: This is insane. Juan Williams: Go, Emily. Greg Gutfeld: You cheated. [cross talk] Juan Williams: Wait, how did she cheat now?

Yes, the same inflatable Santa. There it is. Greg, what just -- Dana Perino: The baby shark was singing. Greg Gutfeld: The shark was singing, and I didn't want to have to like end up getting yelled at. Jesse Watters: All right. Inflatable Santa. This is a runaway anyway, Emily.

Greg Gutfeld: Tom Shillue is back to test us like he does on Fox Nation's fantastic quiz show. Fox Nation, if you don't have it, you should probably get it. Tom Shillue: Absolutely.

Tom Shillue: Certainly, it's a guess. I need an answer. There we go. And the answer is B -- Dana Perino: No! Tom Shillue: -- 1931. Dana Perino: Ugh! Tom Shillue: Emily. Greg Gutfeld: So these guys think there's -- oh, yeah, like you knew it, Jesse. Tom Shillue: Jesse seemed to know it. Jesse Watters: It was obvious that it wasn't C because that was the last one.

Was it the 50s, the 30s, or the 1910s? Dana Perino: It's not the 30s, obviously. Tom Shillue: When did the kids start leaving -- Greg Gutfeld: [LAUGHS] Tom Shillue: -- cookies and milk? Greg Gutfeld: [LAUGHS] The 30s. Male Speaker: This -- let's -- I need an answer here. [CROSSTALK] Tom Shillue: And it was during the Depression, the 1930s. Dana Perino: No way. Tom Shillue: Yes, people -- Dana Perino: Did they even have cookies? Emily Compagno: You're literally getting every single one wrong. Tom Shillue: You wouldn't expect it. People became more generous and -- Greg Gutfeld: Because this is not based on anything other than pure luck. Jesse Watters: No, Greg, it's because she can't cheat on this one. Tom Shillue: -- do we have a tie? Emily Compagno: Oh my gosh. Tom Shillue: I have, I have a tiebreaker question if we have a tie. I don't know what the scores are. Emily Compagno: Okay.

Emily Compagno: [LAUGHS] Greg Gutfeld: We don't need a tiebreaker. Tom Shillue: We don't. [CROSSTALK] Greg Gutfeld: So, meaning we all won. Emily Compagno: What was it -- Dana Perino: Yeah. [CROSSTALK] Male Speaker: The tiebreaker is 1.76 billion candy canes sold every year. That's the answer. Dana Perino: 1.76 billion? Emily Compagno: Oh.

[LAUGHTER] The week is almost over. Our Secret Santa gift exchange when we return. [music playing] [COMMERCIAL BREAK] Juan Williams: Welcome back. You know, this is the moment everybody's been waiting for, our Secret Santa gift exchange. Some people do it on Christmas Eve night, you know, and that's what we're going to do here on The Five. So, let's get started with Miss Emily Compagno. Emily Compagno: Okay. Do I get to give my gifts? Greg Gutfeld: Yeah. What's the, what's -- is she giving or getting? Emily Compagno: But wait -- Juan Williams: No, I think you're getting. Dana Perino: You're getting. You're getting. Juan Williams: You should open your gifts. Emily Compagno: -- oh. Juan Williams: Open your gifts. Greg Gutfeld: Yeah. Jesse Watters: Yes. Greg Gutfeld: You open the first one in front of her, right? Juan Williams: No, no, no. Emily Compagno: That's not -- Juan Williams: That's not hers. Emily Compagno: -- that's Juan's. So, first of all, I totally love the wrapping because it's cars with dogs in them. Dana Perino: Okay. [LAUGHTER] Emily Compagno: What? Am I supposed to be faster? Greg Gutfeld: Open it. Juan Williams: Here, do you need, do you need this? Emily Compagno: God. Juan Williams: Oh my gosh. Emily Compagno: This is horrible. You guys are really mean to me all the time. This was supposed to be the best one. Juan Williams: Let me help you. Let me help. Here. There you go. Jesse Watters: What'd you get? Emily Compagno: Now I think I know who this might be from. It is a fart launcher. [LAUGHTER] Jesse Watters: Hold it up. Greg Gutfeld: See what it is. It actually launches a stinky -- Emily Compagno: For God's sake. Greg Gutfeld: -- smell so you'll always think of me -- Dana Perino: [LAUGHS] Greg Gutfeld: -- when you have it. Emily Compagno: Which I will because on Greg's show last week he asked me if I was going anywhere after the show and I said yes, and then he shot this in my face. [LAUGHTER] Juan Williams: And you know, it's true -- Emily Compagno: Thank you, I guess. Thank you. Greg Gutfeld: Yes. Juan Williams: -- and then he asked me if he should give you perfume for Christmas. Greg Gutfeld: [LAUGHS] Jesse Watters: Okay, Gregory. Greg Gutfeld: No, there's more. Juan Williams: Oh, there's more. There's more. Greg Gutfeld: Right? She has some other gifts. Dana Perino: You get another gift. Okay, hopefully -- Emily Compagno: Aw, Febreze.

[LAUGHTER] Who cares about the car. Emily Compagno: And it says, ""You're welcome, Greg."" That's amazing. Greg Gutfeld: It's a replica of your dog and a replica of your car. Emily Compagno: [LAUGHS] Greg Gutfeld: And a picture, and a replica of me. Jesse Watters: The car's worth more than the head shot. Emily Compagno: I mean, this is probably the most, like the coolest gift I've ever gotten, the car. Greg Gutfeld: By the way, this is something -- Emily Compagno: And then the -- Greg Gutfeld: -- you should probably keep in your house. There are no, like, cameras in it at all. I could stress that enough. Emily Compagno: -- [LAUGHS]. [LAUGHTER] Thank you. Thanks, Greg. This is so awesome. Jesse Watters: Greg, you're not supposed to say that. Greg Gutfeld: [LAUGHS] [CROSSTALK] Greg Gutfeld: Yes. Dana Perino: All right. Juan Williams: But I like the idea that the photos in it for you. But this is also for you, Em. Greg Gutfeld: Oh. Emily Compagno: Wait, no. Juan Williams: Oh, I thought it said Emily. Greg Gutfeld: [LAUGHS] Emily Compagno: This is for later. Juan Williams: Oh, okay. All right, so -- Male Speaker: All right. Greg, look up your -- Juan Williams: -- oh, Gregory. Greg Gutfeld: Yes, yes. Juan Williams: Oh, wonderful child. Lift up, your turn. Greg Gutfeld: Okay. Dana Perino: Here's your gift right here. Greg Gutfeld: Oh. Dana Perino: [LAUGHS] What do you think of the wrapping paper on that? Greg Gutfeld: The wrapping paper's totally awesome. I can't believe you got this wrapping paper. It's fantastic because I've never had seen wrapping paper like this -- Juan Williams: [LAUGHS] Emily Compagno: Greg, you're such a scrooge. Greg Gutfeld: Oh. Jesse Watters: Oh, that looks expensive. Greg Gutfeld: A mechanical keyboard -- Greg Gutfeld: -- inspired by a typewriter. This is like a real gift. Dana Perino: This is, could be a real gift. Greg Gutfeld: [LAUGHS] I can't open it. [LAUGHTER] Juan Williams: Here, you want a scissor? Greg Gutfeld: Oh, there it is. Juan Williams: Okay. All right. [CROSSTALK] Greg Gutfeld: Wow. What is this? Jesse Watters: That looks expensive. Greg Gutfeld: I've never seen this before. Look at this, people. Emily Compagno: Oh, wow. Dana Perino: Yeah. Juan Williams: Does it go clickity, clickity, clickity, click? [CROSSTALK] Jesse Watters: Yeah. Juan Williams: It'll sound like an old newsroom. Greg Gutfeld: Oh, this is going to drive people crazy. Dana Perino: It's going to drive people crazy, but -- okay, I was your Secret Santa. Okay. Jesse Watters: Oh, nice. Dana Perino: See, you put your laptop right here. Greg Gutfeld: [affirmative] Dana Perino: And then you can, and then it wirelessly connects. Jesse Watters: No way. Dana Perino: So, when you're writing your books, you have to make, like, all the noise -- [CROSSTALK] Greg Gutfeld: This is going to drive my wife nuts. Dana Perino: Ding. And then ding -- Emily Compagno: What a great gift. Dana Perino: -- ding. And it connects to all your computers. Greg Gutfeld: This is fantastic. Dana Perino: Do you like it? Emily Compagno: That's perfect. Greg Gutfeld: I love it. Thank you so much. I don't deserve this. [CROSSTALK] Dana Perino: That's probably true. [LAUGHTER] Dana Perino: Oh, I hope you like it. Greg Gutfeld: I will. No, I'm going to -- Dana Perino: Do you have an iPad? Greg Gutfeld: -- no, but I'll get one. Dana Perino: Or just something like that. [LAUGHTER] [CROSSTALK] Greg Gutfeld: Well, I have a laptop, though. Is this only for iPads? Dana Perino: I don't know. I don't think so. I think it works with everything. Greg Gutfeld: I'm going to use this on the, on the airplane. Dana Perino: Oh, that's going to -- Greg Gutfeld: Just to piss off people like you. Dana Perino: -- that's going to drive people crazy, it is. Juan Williams: You know what I like? The name, Qwertytoys [sic]. Greg Gutfeld: Yeah. Yeah. Do you know what that means? Emily Compagno: Yes. Juan Williams: You know what -- Dana Perino: Really qwerty? [CROSSTALK] Emily Compagno: That's the top five on the left side of the keyboard. Juan Williams: Yeah. Dana Perino: It plugs into your computer as well -- Emily Compagno: Yes. Dana Perino: -- they're telling me in my ear. Greg Gutfeld: Oh, fantastic. Emily Compagno: Oh. Greg Gutfeld: How'd you -- Dana Perino: And it has a, and it has a return bar function, so you can go -- Greg Gutfeld: -- oh, this is going to be amazing. [CROSSTALK] Greg Gutfeld: By the way, I'm finishing my new book, which is a self-help book -- [CROSSTALK] Jesse Watters: Two book plugs in one show. [LAUGHTER] Dana Perino: All right. This is -- I'll try to do it fast because there's three things. Oh, tennis. Oh, with The Five -- oh, that's so cute -- with The Five and the Daily Briefing. Greg Gutfeld: Tennis cloth [spelled phonetically]. Dana Perino: Just what I always wanted. Greg Gutfeld: What is that -- oh because you play tennis. Emily Compagno: That's tennis? Dana Perino: Well, I try to play tennis. I mean, I'm not really good at it. Greg Gutfeld: Who is your -- Dana Perino: This is number two. I don't know but I think it's gonna get colder here. Greg Gutfeld: That was a good gift. Jesse Watters: Oh, wait here try this side. Dana Perino: Oh. Greg Gutfeld: Oh, my God it's Gwyneth Paltrow's head. Hey. Emily Compagno: Oh, my God. Dana Perino: That wasn't funny. Jesse Watters: Oh there's a flap, thank you. Juan Williams: Oh, look at this this is perfect for Dana. Perfect. Greg Gutfeld: Holy crap. [CROSSTALK] That is fantastic.

119,FOX,"House Democrats could charge Trump with more articles; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" December 23, 2019. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Jesse Waters, co-host: Hello everybody, I'm Jesse Waters, along with Emily Compagno, Capri Cafaro, Dana Perino, and Tom Shillue. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is ""The Five."" Trump impeachment insanity now turning into a stalemate on Capitol Hill. The president blasting Nancy Pelosi over the weekend for the Democrats impeachment delay. [BEGIN VIDEO CLIP] President Donald Trump: Crazy Nancy. She's crazy. No, no. So, now she says, you know, she has no case. She has no case. So, let's not submit it. That's good, right? That's good. But you know what's so unfair? It's so unfair. She has no case. Did they look bad? They got up the same thing. The Constitution. They are violating the Constitution. Totally. [END VIDEO CLIP] Jesse Waters: Nancy Pelosi is responding by attacking Trump and saying the House isn't going to move forward anytime soon. And crying Chuck Schumer claims that unless Republicans give in to his demands, then the entire thing is a sham. The GOP returning fire by calling out Pelosi's shenanigans. [BEGIN VIDEO CLIP] Mitch McConnell: And it seems to me a rather absurd position to say after you've impeached the president, you won't send the papers over to the Senate. Male Speaker 1 This is a sign of weakness. This is a sign she understands just how weak these articles are. Lindsey Graham: Impeachment is a dead cat. Stop playing with it. Bury it. It's going nowhere. Quit violating the constitution. [END VIDEO CLIP] Jesse Waters: And to top things off, Democrats are considering impeachment 2.0. A court filing revealing the possibility that President Trump could be impeached again, amid a fight over testimony from former White House counsel Don McGahn. I like the dead cat analogy. I thought that was pretty good. Dana Perino, co-host: Nobody wants to play with a dead cat. Nobody wants to have a dead cat. Jesse Waters: No. Well, maybe you don't like cats. You only like dogs. Dana Perino: I like cats. My sister has four rescue cats. Hi, Angie, Torah, all of the other ones. Chewy and all that. Impeachment went so well for them the first time that by planning to do it again and telegraphing that you're going to do it, get over Don McGahn's testimony? That seems a little far-fetched. Yeah. This reminds me of the government shutdown. Do you remember that there was a government shutdown last year? [CROSSTALK] Jesse Waters: We call it the Democrats shutdown. Dana Perino: No, it's the Schumer shut down. Remember? The Schumer shut down. But the Democrats went into that thinking that they were -- had the upper hand now. Now, the president didn't get his while money, but the Democrats ended up having to cave pretty much. So, I think that impeachment feels the same. But there's something that happened that is not getting a lot of attention, I think it's because of all the other activity and it's the holidays. But Doug Jones, who is the Democrat from Alabama, is a senator who's basically said he's not for this impeachment thing. I think that is as big as Jeff Van Drew switching parties from Democrat to Republican on the House side, because it matters a lot. And I think maybe that is because, again, we're all so busy. A lot of Democrats think that other Democrats are in trouble -- Republicans are in trouble, like Cory Gardner of Colorado or Susan Collins of Maine, that they're actually going to have trouble getting reelected. But Doug Jones saying he's not for impeachment, I think shows that he knows it's not meritorious and he's definitely not going to vote for it. Jesse Waters: Shillue do you agree? Tom Shillue, guest co-host: Yes, but no big headlines on Doug Jones. Just like, you know, the switching parties wasn't that big of a story in the mainstream media. What was the big story? Somebody at Christianity Today wrote an article against Trump, so that makes the headline. So, on that side, if you can find anybody at all. And they tried to make it seem like it's this big movement, evangelical support is crumbling. Jesse Waters: Right, and we're going to talk about that in a second. Capri? Capri Cafaro, guest co-host: Yes Jesse? Jesse Waters: I have not been able to understand the strategy behind holding these articles back. We've tried to ask Juan, now let's give you a shot. Capri Cafaro: Peer into my Pelosi crystal ball. Jesse Waters: Why is this such a good move for the Democrats to do? I don't get it. Capri Cafaro: I mean, I think, and we've heard them saying, well, she's trying to get the upper hand because obviously she doesn't have any director jurisdiction over what's happening. Here's what I think the strategy actually is, although I think no one will ever say it. And certainly, you know, Speaker Pelosi will never actually lead with this. But I think it's because there is a lot of apprehension about impeachment and, you know, its public acceptance. And I think what's happening here is, okay, they were able to satiate the base by actually doing some kind of vote on impeachment in the House. But they know there's going to be acquittal in the Senate. So, they have to slow down the train to essentially, you know, play both ends to say, well, look, you know, the Senate wasn't going to be fair, so we weren't going to let this go forward because, you know, this is going to be rigged -- Jesse Waters: So, they're still acting tough for their base. That's what this is about? I still think they're still acting tough with their base. But I think they also do not want to be hamstrung with an actual acquittal because -- Jesse Waters: Well, there's going to be an acquittal. Capri Cafaro: Which is why I think they're trying to -- Jesse Waters: So, they just want the impeachment without the acquittal. Dana Perino: They just want a hung jury. Capri Cafaro: Exactly. That's my theory. I'm not saying it's a good one, but that's what I think is happening. Jesse Waters: I think you might be right about that? What do you think? Emily Compagno, guest co-host: Well, the problem with that, and not with your theory, but the problem with the strategy is the fact that the base didn't need anything additional. All this is is causing those votes that actually do matter more for retaining any support for the Democratic Party, which is those Independents, are the ones that are so exhausted by this and are showing their fatigue and are not supporting this. So, it's like an unnecessary rally. And the other problem is, it belies the entire point of this, which is that it's gamesmanship. It never had anything to do with substance. Otherwise, there would be more of a commitment to evidence. There wouldn't be the hurry up and then slow down that there is now. You know, in law we have consumer confusion and this is like citizen confusion. No one understands this strategy. And during this break -- by the way, this isn't just an average break. This is a holiday break where people are reconnecting with their families. They're restoring from their everyday crazy lives. So, to me, on the other end of this, when Congress reconvenes, there will be an added exhaustion and fatigue and that kind of momentum coming into the new year. Everyone will be extra sick of this. Like, this again? No way. Jesse Waters: All right. Also, media is now smearing evangelicals for refusing to back impeachment. It comes as Christianity Today caused a stir after publishing an editorial calling for Trump's removal from office. Take a look. [BEGIN VIDEO CLIP] Female Speaker: Evangelical Christians, they're giving their full loyalty to the president and not to God. They're not questioning Trump. Male Speaker: The reason they're so offended is, it's exposing all of them that they would take this shameless con man over the principles that they're preaching in the holy season as we celebrate Jesus. They would sell Jesus out if they felt they could get something from it. [END VIDEO CLIP] [CROSSTALK] Dana Perino: So, the dismay that Democrats have about evangelicals and Trump is not new. This has been going on since the very beginning. Like, how dare you? How could you? This, remembe,r going back to Access Hollywood tape, and on and on. And, like, for me, my faith is actually very personal. I don't like to mix it in with politics. I'm not part of the evangelical movement, born Lutheran, baptized Lutheran, but I understand and respect evangelical positions. I also think that if somebody wants to write an editorial in Christianity Today, so be it. Let them. Everybody has an opportunity to give their opinion, we're blessed that we have this opportunity here, we get to do it on television. But it shouldn't be that big a deal. Tom Shillue: I think you see, also, the timing of it. You saw The New York Times op-ed by those Republicans, or former Republicans. They know they're trying to take out some of these Republicans in the Senate and they need an all out pressure campaign against Republicans to guilt them and to shame them into supporting this president, as the stakes are so high with impeachment. Capri Cafaro: You -- look, elected officials are going to listen to the people they work for, and that is the voters at home, not necessarily The New York Times or any other media outlet that's going to try to shame them. I mean, look, there's always been this disconnect between President Trump and his personal, you know, lifestyle or however you want to say being married a number of times and that sort of thing, and that being incongruous with, quote, unquote, ""evangelical values."" The reality is he has governed very strongly for that group of individuals when it comes to appointing judges in a number of executive orders. And that's what they're looking at, not necessarily his personal conduct. Jesse Waters: That is true. He's delivering. Dana Perino: It's a great point. I think it's dangerous to start attacking hypocrisy in mainstream media or media in general. That turns people off. That's very personal to them. And I think that what matters -- you know, people can have a distaste, but what matters is what happens at the ballot box, and that kind of -- the turnover of the circuits and the judge placements and pushing those through that speaks louder than anything else. Jesse Waters: Tom Shillue, take us home, my friend. Tom Shillue: Well, Dana, you're right. It's -- anyone can write an editorial. The thing is, this is one guy, Mark Galli. I watched him on the Sunday shows because, of course, he had a huge open forum and they tried to make it seem like this was a national movement. Really, it's just this one guy and maybe the owner, Dalrymple, of Christianity Today. The thing you look at, though, is the fact that the media treated this it was like some kind of watershed, when it wasn't. They really just -- the follow up article is very interesting, because they just want to, they said, plant a flag. They don't like the fact that the evangelical movement is so tied to Trump. It's hurting them with recruitment with certain groups and they will admit that. So, it's not about impeachment, of which they are very inarticulate. Dana Perino: And what are they offering? Like, what is the alternative? Their alternative is everything that evangelicals are not for. [CROSSTALK] certainly the alternative on the policies. Tom Shillue: Did you hear what Mark Galli said on CBS? He said, ""I'm not political. I leave that up to you."" So, he punted on that. Jesse Waters: And according to the Trump campaign, they're probably going to turn out more Evangelicals than they did this 2016. Capri Cafaro: Oh, yeah, probably, yeah. Jesse Watters: Quick programming note here. Don't miss our Christmas Eve and Christmas Day specials with our biggest secret Santa gift exchange yet, and much, much more. Find out what happens when Emily and I cut down a Christmas tree. Next up, Elizabeth Warren exposed as a giant hypocrite after her attack on Mayor Pete's wine cave fund raisers. [COMMERCIAL BREAK] Dana Perino: It was a Democratic debate moment that put wine caves, believe it or not, on the map. [BEGIN VIDEO CLIP] Elizabeth Warren: The mayor just recently had a fundraiser that was held in a wine cave full of crystals and served $900 a bottle wine. Billionaires in wine caves should not pick the next President of the United States. Pete Buttigieg: I am literally the only person on this stage who's not a millionaire or a billionaire. So if – [Cheers & Applause] This is important. This is the problem with issuing purity tests you cannot yourself pass. [END VIDEO CLIP] Dana Perino: After calling out Mayor Pete Buttigieg for hosting a ritzy wine bar fundraiser, Elizabeth Warren is being called a hypocrite because back in 2018, Warren hosted a $2700-per-person vino-filled fundraiser where guests were given a souvenir bottle of wine. Plus, behind the scenes, former President Obama is reported by telling donors not to back -- it says, ""Back worn."" He's basically saying, ""Yeah, she's fine, she's good, right? She's a politician. She over-promises, but she'll be good."" But he hasn't said the same about Joe Biden. Jesse, I said -- I'm going to try to make a wine for this weekend. Jesse Watters: Yeah? Dana Perino: That's like a little more like -- Jesse Watters: Have you had that much wine -- Dana Perino: -- every day, man. Jesse Watters: -- where you can stack up all those empty bottles? Dana Perino: I can make a fort? Yeah. And then I won't be accused of being an elitist. Jesse Watters: Oh, well -- Dana Perino: What do you think? Jesse Watters: Well, I think -- is Gutfeld in a wine cave right now? Dana Perino: [laughs] Jesse Watters: I think -- I think he is in a wine cave right now. Dana Perino: Wine coma? Jesse Watters: He's in one of the two. We had spoke to Frank Lutz the other day, and he ran the dials on this big exchange -- Dana Perino: Oh, yeah. Jesse Watters: -- of the Democrat voters. Dana Perino: Yeah. Jesse Watters: They didn't like it. Democrats didn't like the attack. They didn't even like the counterpunch. They don't like them attacking each other, especially on stupid issues like a wine cave. Pete's the poorest guy on the stage. The guy still has student loan debt. He has -- tom Steyer could just go like that and clear his debt. But who knows? She, Warren, is a millionaire. Bernie is a millionaire. Hillary was a multimillionaire. What are they talking about? Barack Obama could go to a wine cave fundraiser, cut a big check for Mayor Pete, and all of a sudden, that's corrupting? How is that corrupting? It's like, what if some billionaire invented the electric car, he's saving the world, and then cuts you a check for your campaign because he hates Trump just as much as you do, and you're going to turn that money away? It doesn't make any sense at all. And the Democrats, they did this to themselves. They create these kind of like hypocritical traps for themselves. They demonize the wealthy, and then they beg the wealthy for money in secret and then get ashamed when they get caught. Emily Compagno: So, this is -- this is where I come down on this because I actually think that it would have been a really good opportunity to turn this entire conversation on its head. Instead, of course, Democrats like to fight with each other, and we never -- you know, what is the -- what is the joke they say? Like, you know, ""I'm not a member of an organized party, I'm a Democrat""? Jesse Watters: Okay. Emily Compagno: It's kind of one of those situations, right? So, if I'm in this exchange with Mayor Pete or Elizabeth Warren, I'm going to sit there and say, ""Look, you know what? I have to play by the rules that we are given right now --"" Jesse Watters: Yeah. Emily Compagno: "" -- because we have to raise a bunch of money. Unless we have campaign finance reform, which we can't do because conservative judges are on the bench and the Supreme Court keeps making, you know --"" Dana Perino: Nobody cares about that anyway. Emily Compagno: "" -- corporations, people, then guess what? I still have to take this money."" You don't set up some kind of a hypocritical test because -- Jesse Watters: Right. Emily Compagno: -- everybody has to have money because campaigns are becoming billion -- multi-billion-dollar -- Dana Perino: [unintelligible] yeah. Emily Compagno: -- exercises. Make it about campaign finance reform, not about wife. Dana Perino: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez talked about purity tests. Take a listen to this. [BEGIN VIDEO CLIP] Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: For anyone who accuses us for instituting purity tests, it's called having values. It's called giving a damn. [cheers] It's called having standards for your conduct. [END VIDEO CLIP] Tom Shillue: So many things. Emily Compagno: It's called a lot of things. Tom Shillue: It is. Dana Perino: But I mean, I just think that they're going to have to go back on this anyway when they get to the general because if they want to be competitive with President Trump, they're going to have to raise some money. Tom Shillue: Pete Buttigieg was the one who was caught in the wine cave, okay? And I know Elizabeth Warren. She is a real beer drinker. I've seen the videos. Jesse Watters: Yeah. Tom Shillue: She likes to pop a couple of pops. But I -- I mean, I don't know how they're going to get away from this. That is their -- that's their base now is wine cave people. I kind of like this thing, this attack by Elizabeth Warren. But you know that Donald Trump is going to pick up on it because he knows they're all wine cave people, and he is not a wine cave guy. Jesse Watters: He doesn't drink at all. Dana Perino: I mean, but we like wine. We're not -- Emily Compagno: Yeah. Dana Perino: -- against it, right, Emily? Emily Compagno: I mean, my family owns a winery. I feel like all of it like -- Dana Perino: Do you feel -- Emily Compagno: -- and a wine cave -- yeah. Dana Perino: You should. Emily Compagno: I feel -- Jesse Watters: How have we never gotten a bottle of wine and your family owns a winery? Emily Compagno: No, I'm kidding. It has to -- first of all, wine cave is about storage. But whatever, this is stupid. I think -- [Laughter] I think the larger part, other than actual -- you know, making wine is more about agriculture and like digging in the dirt. It's difficult to turn a profit for a winery. But anyway, that -- this is one more example of Elizabeth Warren and others from the left telling people that their voters matters less and they are valid less as a voter because of something about them. So, remember, after the debates, we talked about this, that there were elements. There are people in the mainstream media saying that the ""Trump Regional Party is now from the mountain and the south."" And the non-college educated chimed, a WaPo contributor. And then we have Elizabeth Warren who claims she's a capitalist; and yet, to someone who became a billionaire off of a capitalist society, potentially creating a service that actually helped others in this society, that definitely created employment, that definitely gave them insurance and paid taxes on, that -- she said they ""shouldn't elect our president."" So, their vote matters less. And this kind of alienation, it won't be forgotten. It doesn't matter that, like, it always happens. We start far from the left and then, by the time we get to the general, they've corrected. I don't understand how the correction can come back from this when the strategy is alienation of others of how they should be demonized because of something about them. Dana Perino: Jesse, it is interesting, like what Frank Luntz was saying, that nobody liked it. Is it that they don't like the class warfare? Like the way that the argument is set up? Or this one in particular, I wonder. Jesse Watters: This was, this specifically was a dumb line of attack. But he says, generally, they don't like watching Democrats attack each other. They only like watching Democrats attack Donald Trump. But if that's going to be the case, no one's going to win this thing -- [LAUGHTER] -- because you have to compete, and elbow, and you know, fight for the nomination. Dana Perino: Well, someone is going to win. We will see who it is. Up next, Robert De Niro unleashes his most explosive anti-Trump tirade yet. [COMMERCIAL BREAK] 
Carpi Cafaro: Well, it is no secret that Robert De Niro hates President Trump. [BEGIN VIDEO CLIP] Robert De Niro: Today, the world is suffering from the ""real"" Donald Trump. This [bleep] idiot is the president. The guy is a [bleep] fool. Come on. This guy has sullied the presidency, he's debased the presidency, it's just, it's just beyond surreal. He has no idea of what his purpose in life is as the president should be. I always say he's a low life. Joy Behar: Yeah. Robert De Niro: He is a low life. [END VIDEO CLIP] Carpi Cafaro: But now the ""Raging Bull"" actor is taking things to a whole new level. Check out what many are calling his most unhinged anti-Trump rant yet. [BEGIN VIDEO CLIP] Robert De Niro: I'd like to see a big [bleep] right in his face. Hit him right in the face, like that, and let the picture go all over the world and that would be the most humiliating thing because he needs to be humiliated. He needs to be confronted and humiliated by whoever the, his opponent is, his political opponent. [END VIDEO CLIP] Carpi Cafaro: Wow. Okay. So, basically, we needed to bleep out most of all of that. [LAUGHTER] He's sounding a little bit to me more like Joe Pesci than Robert De Niro. And you know, here's somebody who, you know, from day one has not been a fan of President Trump. But you know, look, my question to you, Tom Shillue -- Tom Shillue: Yeah. Carpi Cafaro: -- is when are we going to give up on caring about what celebrities think about politics? I mean, who cares? I mean, look, you know, he has, like, his right to his opinion and everything else. But I mean, why are we even talking about this? Tom Shillue: Well, people love this stuff. They love the most strident anti-Trump voices. But you notice the people like De Niro, he has a great deal of intelligence as an actor. When you watch him work, he's obviously -- he's super gifted and he has intelligence in that area. But when he talks about politics, it's not smart at all. So, he -- obviously, he's got a block there. He's also very angry. And why has the president debased the presidency when De Niro is saying worse things than Donald Trump ever said with this ""I'd like to smear a bag of you know what in his face?"" Jesse Watters: Yeah. Tom Shillue: Why? Like, why does he think that is going to make his point? I don't really understand. So, I would like to sit with him and say, ""Look, if he has debased the presidency, the country, everything so much, what is it? Give me the line,"" -- Carpi Cafaro: So, Tom, is this -- Tom Shillue: -- ""give me the thing that Trump said."" Carpi Cafaro: -- is this an invitation for Robert De Niro to come on your quiz show? [crosstalk] Tom Shillue: I would love it. I would love it. [LAUGHTER] But yeah, it is. And I want to contrast someone like De Niro with someone like Jon Voight. When he speaks about politics. He articulates policy, he talks about actually things, not just ""I want to shove a bag of you know what in his face."" Carpi Cafaro: I loved him as Zoolander's father. Tom Shillue: Yeah. Carpi Cafaro: I just want to point that out. So, Emily, you know, you bring up a -- Tom brought up this point about Jon Voight. But you know, if someone said this about Hillary Clinton, about Barack Obama, about any democrat, about Nancy Pelosi. You know, if it was an actor, more conservative-leaning, saying they want to throw certain things in one of these democratic electives face, do you think that we would just be brushing it off? Or would we be talking about it? Emily Compagno: Well, I think that, no matter what, there is a bias in mainstream media that would be hypocritical in its coverage of who says what about what side of the party or what party. For me, when I hear this, I just take it as comedy; like, you guys heard me laughing. Like, I think it's funny to hear it that way. I listen to anyone who is thoughtful, regardless of what they are saying or what their views are; if they are thoughtful and articulate, then I listen and then I form my own opinion. I think what disturbs me more coming out of Hollywood, though, is that the celebration of being arrested. And I think that kind of -- Female Speaker: That's a really good point. Emily Compagno: -- the fabric, the flagrance of ""It's my turn,"" like, I think that's a disgusting -- Female Speaker: I agree. Emily Compagno: -- shameful trivialization of what is a crippling aspect of our society. And if they had any type of gravitas, if they had any kind of self-respect, then they would take that energy and that exposure and put it towards actual criminal justice reforms rather than shoving in our face the fact that their wealthy attorney can get them out of jail immediately. Carpi Cafaro: And I know, Dana, you've talked about that before. I've seen you post on Twitter about, you know, the concerns about, you know, somebody like Jane Fonda just going out there and getting arrested time and time again. Dana Perino: Yeah. Carpi Cafaro: And then what kind of message does that send to other people, that -- Dana Perino: Well, when a celebrity talks about politics, it's like when I try to talk about sports. Jesse Watters: [laughs] Carpi Cafaro: Amen. Dana Perino: Everybody cringes and no one takes it seriously. [LAUGHTER] And when it comes to Robert De Niro, so my husband and stepson last night, they started watching that movie on Netflix, the Irishman. And I was like, kind of turned -- I have to separate my politics from the entertainment that I like to watch. But I have to say, like for this one in particular, I was, like, yeah, I'm just not that into it. And I left. Capri Cafaro: Interesting. Jesse, what's your take on this? Are you signing up for what Robert De Niro is selling or what? Jesse Waters: No, obviously. Capri Cafaro: I'm shocked. [LAUGHTER] Jesse Waters: I actually was talking to your husband about this and we agreed he's a great actor, but he plays the same character in every single role. And now he's playing the same character every time he does an interview. He's just a Trump hater. And I think this is just publicity for The Irishman. His team knows it. His entourage thinks it's good, because usually he's a boring interview. And now he gets real animated when he talks about how much he hates Trump, so they're going with it. Also, I don't think people care about what these celebrities say about politics anymore. It's because -- 20 years ago, they were the only ones who can get on their soapbox and have a platform. Now, everyone has Twitter, everyone has social media. There's thousands of different cable channels. Everyone can say whatever they want. So, what he says doesn't have as big of an impact. Capri Cafaro: Well, and we haven't heard, I don't think we've heard President Trump tweet about this yet, but who knows? Anything's possible. But up next, get ready for a green Christmas. The extreme recommendations climate activists have for you this year. [COMMERCIAL BREAK]  Emily Compagno: Liberal activists are pushing for you to go green this Christmas. The New York Times highlighting the zero waste holidays trend, saying, quote, ""Glitter, tinsel and shiny wrapping paper are now signs of the apocalypse. So, instead, you should opt for orange peel garlands, ornaments made from dried apples or citrus slices, hemp wrapping paper, bows made from food wrappers. And you should ditch the Christmas tree for an Evergleam aluminum tree,"" which I'm sure it's totally insta-friendly. So, Tom, tell me about messages like this that are pretty damning when people might have -- like gone that extra mile if it wasn't rammed down their throat? Tom Shillue: Well, look, I was the original environmentalist because we had an Evergleam tree. Our tree was 100 percent made out of tinsel. Look at that fake tree. Dana Perino: Aww, look at that picture! Tom Shillue: We stored it in the attic and then we could use it every year. Capri Cafaro: Does it have one of those wheels that -- like the color wheel things? Dana Perino: I love that. Tom Shillue: I mean, I don't know what -- it was cheap. And the thing is, my mother was an environmentalist because she was cheap. [LAUGHTER] Because we would reuse paper plates. I mean, she'd reuse everything, unwrapped presents -- Jesse Waters: I think you just cracked the code. Environmentalists are just cheap people. I think you're right, I think you're onto something. I think they're cheap. I think we don't have the money to get the good stuff for Christmas, and then they count that in saving the environment. Dana Perino: So mean. [CROSSTALK] Jesse Waters: He's the one that said it. Tom Shillue: The thing is, back in the old days. That's why everyone did it. You know, they worked on a budget and then we were supposed to open our presents and not rip the paper, because we're going to reuse that paper next year. Dana Perino: Yeah, that's how my grandfather did it for that same reason. So, my mom inherited that, too. The saving everything for that reason. I just think that it's great to not be overly consumptive, but I don't ever want any message rammed down my throat. I don't want to hear of something being an apocalypse. And I think giving people a choice is so much more effective. Emily Compagno: It is not persuasive. However, I agree with a lot of that. There is a lot of waste. And we are asking like, in the commercial break, when you open presents, are you the kind of person that cleans up right away, as people are unwrapping their presents? Or do you wait until the end? And turns out the only body -- the only person here that waits until the end, that loves a mess, is Tom. [CROSSTALK] Capri Cafaro: I think we've cracked the code on that, too, because here's a guy that had to reuse paper plates. Now all of the sudden, like he wants to hoard all of the waste. [LAUGHTER] [CROSSTALK] I'm with you, Emily. I mean, I really think that, you know, it's more important to have a choice. I don't, you know, begrudge anybody for their habits if they want to be, you know, zero waste for the holidays, that's fine. But, you know, don't tell me that I can't have glittery stuff because that's what the holidays are all about. Dana Perino: I don't like glitter because it gets on my face. Jesse Waters: Yeah, that's annoying. Capri Cafaro: Shiny, shiny. Jesse Waters: Here's the deal, Emily. The New York Times, in the spirit of this whole saving the world thing, why don't they just go digital? They print massive amounts of paper every single day. Everybody just reads the front page, maybe the sports page. They throw it out, and then they do it all over again the next day. The New York Times, they're the ones cutting down all the trees. They're the ones wasting the paper. They don't get the chance to lecture us. We should be lecturing them. Emily Compagno: Here's my question to you guys. Are you extra sensitive when you're giving a gift to someone who feels that way? This year, for example, I don't want my family -- [CROSSTALK] But I was more sensitive. I gave it to them in the Amazon gift bags that I had already gotten from other people. And then to other people that I could do my full glam presence with, I did. Tom Shillue: You know people like this, Emily? Emily Compagno: I'm from the west coast. Tom Shillue: You know, people like this, they decorate their aluminum trees with dried apples? Emily Compagno: A few that are that extreme -- [CROSSTALK] Come to Berkeley. I will show you Berkeley. That's number one. Number two, the more -- the majority of friends I have that are like that are a little bit more reasonable. So, it's like, look, you guys, let's reuse this, let recycle this -- [CROSSTALK]. Dana Perino: -- for years and I have now trash anxiety. And there was this whole article in The New York Times over the weekend about how, you know, China is refusing to take our trash where they used to take it, and then they would deal with it, and we would just pay, be like, okay, thanks. Then China said, actually, no thanks, we don't want any of that. And now we -- all of these localities are having a really hard time figuring out what to do with all of this trash and the plastics. I'm having a slight panic attack about it. Jesse Waters: That's why we can use paper straws, Dana. Tom Shillue: I was ahead of the curve on the paper straws thing. Dana Perino: I like the paper straw thing. And I like pasta straws. Emily Compagno: I was just going to say, pasta straws is the new -- Jesse Watters: Ooh, pasta straws. Emily Compagno: -- is the new thing. Dana Perino: Yeah, I like them. Jesse Watters: Oh, and then you could eat it afterwards. Dana Perino: Yeah. Emily Compagno: Little crunchy. Dana Perino: Very good. Just dip it in some sauce. Emily Compagno: I got an aluminum straw because it was a free like bonus -- Dana Perino: Don't talk about it. Don't, don't. Emily Compagno: It hasn't left my suitcase. It lives in it. Dana Perino: Well, that's good because you see what happened to that one lady that had it. Emily Compagno: No. Capri Cafaro: What? Dana Perino: Okay, I'll tell you on the break. Jesse Watters: Wow. Dana Perino: Don't use one. Emily Compagno: That sounds scary. Capri Cafaro: Oh, my God. Jesse Watters: She impaled? Dana Perino: Yes. Emily Compagno: Oh, my God. Dana Perino: Through her eye. Jesse Watters: Oh. Dana Perino: I'm telling -- I'm sorry, but it happened. Capri Cafaro: How did she get the -- Dana Perino: I don't know. I don't want to talk about it. I told you I'd tell you when we take a break. Jesse Watters: Aluminum straw market right there, Dana. Emily Compagno: Anything can be a weapon. All right. The Fastest Seven is up next. [COMMERCIAL BREAK] Tom Shillue: Welcome back. Time for the Fastest Seven. First up, turns out Cats was less than purr-fect. See what I did there? Oh, I got you, Jesse. The movie bombed at the box office this weekend, and now Universal Pictures is providing movie theaters with an updated version of the musical to improve the special effects following widespread -- Dana Perino: Mm-hmm. Tom Shillue: -- backlash. Mm-hmm, Dana. I'm sick of the TGI. Female Speaker: Turns out -- turns out Cats was a dog. Jesse Watters: Oh, ho-ho. Emily Compagno: Oh. Tom Shillue: That's right. Dana Perino: If they had a made a movie about dogs, they would not have this problem. Tom Shillue: You don't think so? Dana Perino: No. Tom Shillue: Well, what if they dressed up as the doggies, and then they did the -- they should of just kept it without the CGI. I'm sick of CGI -- Jesse Watters: You are. Tom Shillue: -- Jesse. Jesse Watters: Stop playing with a dead cat, Dana. Listen. I love box office bombs because as you know, Watters World was named after one of the biggest box offense -- Tom Shillue: Right. Jesse Watters: -- bombs of all time with -- Emily Compagno: That's true. Jesse Watters: -- Kevin Costner. That budget was a -- wait, $235 million to make water world, and it only grossed 170 -- 88 million, only 88 million. This, they spent a hundred million dollars on Cats. Tom Shillue: Yeah. Jesse Watters: It only made 2.6 million. Emily Compagno: Oh, man. Jesse Watters: They're already in the whole for 95 million. Capri Cafaro: My sister and her friends went on Friday as a joke because they had came to the conclusion it was going to be so bad it was good, and there was like drinking games, I think, involved -- Jesse Watters: Yeah. Capri Cafaro: -- and whatnot. And apparently, it was so bad -- Dana Perino: Wow. Capri Cafaro: -- that it actually was not -- it wasn't -- Tom Shillue: Oh. Capri Cafaro: It was not good. Tom Shillue: Not good. Capri Cafaro: It actually was not funny. Dana Perino: Gosh. Capri Cafaro: So, it really was that big of a bomb. Emily Compagno: You guys, I really am reserving judgment. I am still totally stoked to see this. Jesse Watters: You are? Emily Compagno: We talked about this earlier. Yes, I am. Capri Cafaro: What? Emily Compagno: For the performing artist aspect of it, I can't wait to see Francesca how -- like I -- I am genuinely still excited. And oftentimes, I think movies that critics are like, ""Eh,"" I am completely entertained by it. Jesse Watters: Me to. Emily Compagno: I mean, how many -- yeah. Capri Cafaro: Apparently, this show is now called Outnumbered. Tom Shillue: Yeah. There it is. Jesse Watters: Yeah, they destroyed Dumb and Dumber, and, like, that movie was one of my all-time favorites. Dana Perino: [laughs] Tom Shillue: The critics hated that. Emily Compagno: Wait, right. Which movie? Jesse Watters: Dumb and Dumber. Capri Cafaro: Oh. Emily Compagno: Yeah, yeah, it's perfect. Tom Shillue: Next, there is a new tech condition people are experiencing called Phantom Phone Syndrome. It's when people feel like their smartphones are constantly buzzing with texts and alerts even when their phones are nowhere near their body. It's now being classified a real psychological phenomenon and a legitimate hallucination. I feel this all the time, Emily. What do you think? Emily Compagno: I don't like the legitimate hallucination aspect because then I just think that someone's going to use it as a defense to some type of crime that they were arrested and charged with. Tom Shillue: Yeah. Emily Compagno: I think it's ridiculous. My friend used to have her ringer from her boss as a fire alarm, that really, like, [makes beeping sound], and we all got PTSD from that. And it was -- it was horrible. So, I don't know. All this stuff is -- Tom Shillue: But, I mean, am I the only one who feels -- I feel my leg vibrating. Jesse Watters: Yeah. Capri Cafaro: No. Because I don't have any alerts of any kind. Emily Compagno: Yeah -- Jesse Watters: You're like Chris Matthews. Tom Shillue: Yeah. Jesse Watters: Snow goes up your leg. Tom Shillue: Yeah. Dana Perino: I think -- Emily Compagno: Oh, God. Dana Perino: This is my advice to everybody. Turn off all your alerts. You look at your phone enough that you also don't need alerts, and you don't need the ones that make noise or the ones that vibrate. Tom Shillue: Fox News -- do you get the Fox News Alert? ""Shhhh-kunggg."" Dana Perino: Nope. Tom Shillue: It makes the Fox News sound. Dana Perino: I don't. [CROSSTALK] Dana Perino: No, I turned it all on silent. Capri Facaro: It's just visual on mine, yeah. Emily Compagno: I think people actually are not separate from their phones, so they really are feeling this. I don't think it's a hallucination. I think that everyone is pretty much surgically attached to their phone and so therefore there is no separation, and so it's not really hallucination. I will -- that's not a word. Tom Shillue: It's -- you're having trouble with that. Emily Compagno: You know what I mean. Capri Cafaro: We know what you mean. Tom Shillue: But, do you feel it? Do you feel a vibrating in your pocket -- Emily Compagno: I feel the train. Female Speaker: Do you feel what I do? Emily Compagno: I feel the train right now. Jesse Watters: I think it's mysterious and amusing. Tom Shillue: Yeah. Female Speaker: Either one. Tom Shillue: It is phantom because it is -- Jesse Watters: You've never felt it? Tom Shillue: Yeah. Female Speaker A phantom -- Tom Shillue: Finally! Dana Perino: No. Tom Shillue: You don't keep your phones, then we'll go to the next. Oh, right here. Don't mess with this fearless canine. Look at this. That's Duke. [video playing] Tom Shillue: To take down a suspect in the heroic hound also served in Iraq with the Marines. Don't worry. The pooch is doing just fine. Look at that, right through the window. Capri Cafaro: How is he not all cut up, that poor doggy? Emily Compagno: He isn't. Look, can I speak to this for a second? Because we interviewed -- I got to interview his handler, Officer Neff, and that dog, Duke, this weekend for Fox & Friends. Jesse Watters: Did Duke take you down when you did that shoot? Emily Compagno: It was a different dog. Jesse Watters: Oh, okay. Emily Compagno: But we showed them the clip. It was the hilarious. We all know I had the honor of working with law enforcement canines right there. Jesse Watters: There she is. Emily Compagno: At Joint Base MDL in Jersey. Tom Shillue: Oh. Jesse Watters: Oh. Tom Shillue: -- choose to have. Jesse Watters: That's you? [CROSSTALK] Jesse Watters: Let's watch it again. Emily Compagno: That screen pretty much shattered all the glass we need. But that -- the officer and dog were so cute. You guys, his birthday, the canine, Duke, his birthday is on Christmas Eve. He's turning seven. And he said that he's his dog. He takes him home every night, and that he's super doggy. And he was like climbing all over the officer. He was so cute. Tom Shillue: Super doggy. Emily Compagno: And also an asset. Tom Shillue: Dana, they softened it up, though. Like that window, at first I thought he broke the window, but I think they pre-broke it. Dana Perino: It had -- it was almost -- like they had shot it, right, a little bit. Tom Shillue: Yeah. Dana Perino: It wasn't broken all the way through. And he had never -- and the dog, as Emily told me, had never actually done that -- Tom Shillue: Ooh. Dana Perino: -- when the blast was still intact. Tom Shillue: Yeah. Dana Perino: But Duke, he is amazing, and we have to -- you know, a lot of gratitude for these animals that help us. Tom Shillue: This is a year for the animals, right? Jesse Watters: Animals are great. Emily Compagno: See? Animals are great. Every time I'm on The Five, the song, even without Gutfeld, just goes around in my head for days on head so... Tom Shillue: Yeah. But who was that dog, the one that the president -- Jesse Watters: Conan? Tom Shillue: -- decorated? Dana Perino: Conan. Tom Shillue: Conan. Jesse Watters: A girl dog or a boy dog? Did we ever figure that out? Emily Compagno: A boy. Dana Perino: I think they decided boy. Jesse Watters: We went with boy? Okay. Dana Perino: Yeah. Tom Shillue: Conan -- Dana Perino: ""They."" Jesse Watters: ""They."" [Laughter] Tom Shillue: One More Thing is up next. [COMMERCIAL BREAK] Jesse Watters: It is time for One More Thing. I was in Philly last night watching the Eagles beat the Cowboys. Tom Shillue: [laughs] Jesse Watters: That's why I lost my voice, I was screaming so loudly. So, we just need one more win and we make the playoffs. We actually host the home playoff game, very exciting. Cowboys also, you know, losers off the field. Male Speaker: End zone. Jesse Watters: After they lost -- Dana Perino: [laughs] Jesse Watters: -- their plane had a mechanical error and they got stuck in Philly for hours, and hours, and hours, barely made it back to Dallas. So, serves them right. Also -- Tom Shillue: [laughs] That's nice. Jesse Watters: -- Jesse's bonsai tree news, and here's the news: My tree is dead. Dana Perino: What happened? Jesse Watters: Here's the tree when I first got it. Dana Perino: [laughs] Jesse Watters: Very lush, beautiful. And there is the tree. So, we've launched an -- Emily Compagno: Those are, like -- -- investigation -- Emily Compagno: -- rare, I feel like. Jesse Watters: -- and all fingers are pointing to Johnny for killing the tree. Dana Perino: [laughs] Emily Compagno: No, Johnny. Jesse Watters: There he is being interrogated. Emily Compagno: He always gets blamed for everything. [crosstalk] Jesse Watters: Listen -- Emily Compagno: I'll be his defense attorney. Jesse Watters: -- listen, there's a -- Carpi Cafaro: Oh, no. Jesse Watters: -- yes. So -- Carpi Cafaro: RIP. Jesse Watters: -- goodnight, sweet bonsai. You will be missed. Dana Perino: I wondered if you were going to admit why your voice was so hoarse. Jesse Watters: Yes, and not cigarettes. Dana Perino: No. Jesse Watters: Cheering for the Eagles. Dana Perino: Well, I remember. He doesn't smoke. [LAUGHTER] All right. So, it's wonderful when a community comes together, I think we can all agree. So, this happened in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina at the Costco. It's employees and the Costco members. They all pulled together to feed the families of 50 students from a local high school for the two weeks that they will be out over the school holidays. The act was done with the support of the Mount Pleasant Chamber of Commerce right there in South Carolina, which is so nice people were helping others at Christmastime. I also want to take a moment and send good thoughts to Don L. Johnson, Jr. [spelled phonetically]. He's in the hospital right now. He has a serious brain injury, but he is recovering. He's a husband, father, grandfather, and a Vietnam War veteran. We are sure that you are going to get a lot better, Don, and we wish you the best from The Five. Jesse Watters: Don Johnson, what a name. Carpi Cafaro: Prayers. Tom Shillue: Fantastic. Jesse Watters: All right, Emily. Emily Compagno: Okay. So, this -- [LAUGHTER] -- I love this story. So, this Waterloo, Illinois cop was on his way home. He was driving back after a busy shift all day. And as we know, much of the Midwest was blanketed with snow this weekend. And he saw a six-year-old playing in his front yard, playing with snowballs. And so, this guy, this cop, stopped -- Officer Shaun Wiegand -- and they had this amazing snowball fight in this kid's front yard. The video was caught by Nicole Murphy, who's six-year-old nephew was the one playing with Officer Wiegand. Female Speaker: How cute. Emily Compagno: Totally cute. Merry Christmas to them. [crosstalk] Jesse Watters: Snowballs are -- where was this? Emily Compagno: That was Wisconsin. Jesse Watters: Okay. Emily Compagno: This is waterloo, Illinois. Yeah. Jesse Watters: Okay, they're legal there. Dana Perino: They're not illegal. [crosstalk] Emily Compagno: Not illegal on this one. [LAUGHTER] Dana Perino: Not with the cops there. Jesse Watters: Yes. Carpi Cafaro: Killing fun. Jesse Watters: They'd have Internal Affairs looking at that. All right, Tom Shillue, everybody. Tom Shillue: All right, here we go. Okay, I love this video. This happened in Ireland. Sean Costello was at the zoo with his family. Let's take a look. Female Speaker: Oh, yeah. [crosstalk] Tom Shillue: His family told him to stay. Look. Jesse Watters: Oh my god. Carpi Cafaro: Whoa. Dana Perino: [laughs] Tom Shillue: Dana, I love that, I love that you're laughing. [crosstalk] Dana Perino: Because I saw it earlier and it's funny. Tom Shillue: Yeah. Well, the great thing about it is the dad says, ""Sean, stay."" He makes his kid stay, right? [LAUGHTER] Emily Compagno: Oh my gosh. Tom Shillue: Then, when the kid runs away screaming, his whole family just started laughing. And I thought that reminds me of my family. [LAUGHTER] Jesse Watters: Oh. Carpi Cafaro: Oh. Emily Compagno: That's like the -- [crosstalk] Jesse Watters: He ran into the glass window? Tom Shillue: Yeah. It's strong glass, though. Dana Perino: I mean, I'm just laughing because everything's fine [laughs]. Tom Shillue: Yes. [crosstalk] Carpi Cafaro: Well, thank goodness the -- Emily Compagno: Is the kid okay? Carpi Cafaro: -- glass like -- Dana Perino: Well, we'll know in 20 years. Carpi Cafaro: -- right. Emily Compagno: Oh my god. Tom Shillue: His dad posted the video and he said, ""My son was on the menu at the zoo today."" I thought [unintelligible]. [crosstalk] Dana Perino: The things you'll do for Instagram. Carpi Cafaro: Dad. Jesse Watters: If it was that canine, he would've blasted right through the glass. Emily Compagno: Exactly. Jesse Watters: Like he did in the busted window. Emily Compagno: Exactly. They're lucky it was a big cat and not -- Carpi Cafaro: He's not going to be a Detroit Tiger fan, that kid. Emily Compagno: -- [laughs] Carpi Cafaro: But I guess he's in Ireland, right? Dana Perino: That's like -- Jesse Watters: That's true. Dana Perino: -- better than the movie ""Cats."" [LAUGHTER] Jesse Watters: That's right. Okay, Capri. Carpi Cafaro: Well, in the never-ending saga of Carpi Cafaro's One More Thing that always has to do with music, this week I am happy to report that my sister, Renee, and I had the incredible opportunity to guest D.J. on SiriusXM -- Emily Compagno: Oh. Carpi Cafaro: -- Classic Vinyl from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in our home state of Ohio. Emily Compagno: Wow. Carpi Cafaro: We love the tunes. And so, we had a chance to play a whole hour of classic rock from David Bowie to Badfinger and Black Sabbath, Chicago to Cream, and the Yardbirds. So, we had an absolute blast. It was for a good cause. And apparently, a lot of people listen to classic vinyl, according to my dad who -- Dana Perino: I have to tell Peter that. So, he -- Carpi Cafaro: -- so -- Dana Perino: -- has bought a record player, or whatever you would call it. Anyway. [LAUGHTER] And now there's like this big collection of vinyl that's -- Carpi Cafaro: -- yeah. Dana Perino: -- growing at our house. I don't even know if he knows about that channel. Carpi Cafaro: Classic Vinyl. It's classic rock from 1964 to 1976. Dana Perino: Wow. [crosstalk] Carpi Cafaro: So, we were going through the catalogue trying to figure out, okay, like there are certain bands that were in a cutoff that -- we like some of the stuff in the later 70s, but we had to do it late 60s. And so -- Tom Shillue: What if -- would they circumscribe your -- what if you picked something that they didn't like? Like if you were like, ""I want Pat Boone?"" Carpi Cafaro: -- we gave them 25 songs and then when -- we got, like, 10, so -- and we actually, I actually pulled the ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"" by Iron Butterfly -- Tom Shillue: Yeah. Carpi Cafaro: -- because they picked the 17-minute version. And I was like, ""Yo, you're killing my vibe here. I want -- I asked you to play the single version, which is two minutes."" We had to pull ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida."" [crosstalk] Tom Shillue: Come on, it's not ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"" without that drum solo. [LAUGHTER] Jesse Watters: Let's do it. Let's hear it, Tom. Come on. Tom Shillue: I can't. Come on, I mean -- Jesse Watters: Come on. Tom Shillue: -- I mean, I could -- Jesse Watters: You got that. Tom Shillue: -- yeah. [LAUGHTER] Jesse Watters: The producers don't want to hear it. All right. Sorry, maybe next time. That's it for us. Don't miss our Christmas Eve and Christmas Day specials. We have a lot of fun surprises planned. Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

120,FOX,"Democrats clash in final debate of the year; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" December 20, 2019. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Juan Williams, co-host: Hello, everyone, I'm Juan Williams, along with Emily Compagno, Jessie Waters, Dana Perino, and Gregory. It's 5 o'clock New York City. Happy holidays. This is ""The Five."" It was a Democratic slugfest, the 2020 presidential candidates mixing it up during the sixth primary debate. Mayor Pete Buttigieg the target of many of those attacks. Take a look. [BEGIN VIDEO CLIP] Elizabeth Warren: The mayor just recently had a fundraiser that was held in a wine cave full of crystals and served $900-a-bottle wine, think about who comes to that. Pete Buttigieg: Senator, your net worth is one hundred times mine. This is the problem with issuing purity tests you cannot yourself pass. Amy Klobuchar: When we were in the last debate, Mayor, you basically mocked the hundred years of experience on the stage. So, you can dismiss committee hearings, I think this experience works, and I have not denigrated your experience as a local official. I have been one. [END VIDEO CLIP] Juan Williams: And the issue over lack of diversity on the stage also came up. [BEGIN VIDEO CLIP] Andrew Yang: It's both an honor and disappointment to be the lone candidate of color on the stage tonight. I miss Kamala, I miss Corey. Though, I think Corey will be back. Tim Alberta: Senator Sanders, you are the oldest candidate on stage. Bernie Sanders: I'm white as well. [END VIDEO CLIP] [laughter] Juan Williams: Well, that's true. And actually, the best answer to that question came from Elizabeth Warren, who said she'd be the youngest woman. Of course, the 2020 contenders, they were sure to go after President Trump. [BEGIN VIDEO CLIP] Bernie Sanders: We have a president who is running the most corrupt administration in the modern history. Amy Klobuchar: Watergate? This is a global Watergate. Tom Steyer: I'm the person who started the need to impeach movement over two years ago. [END VIDEO CLIP] Juan Williams: And finally, one of the surprises of the night coming from Andrew Yang. [BEGIN VIDEO CLIP] Andrew Yang: If you turn on cable network news today, you would think he's our president because of some combination of Russia, racism, Facebook, Hillary Clinton, and emails all mixed together. But Americans around the country know different. What we have to do is we have to stop being obsessed over impeachment and start actually digging in and solving the problems that got Donald Trump elected in the first place. [END VIDEO CLIP] Juan Williams: So, Dana, you know, how I'm such a naïf. I've never been to a wine cave, but that's all I'm hearing about today. Wine cave, wine cave. What is a wine cave? Dana Perino, co-host: A wine cave is where you complain about something -- Jesse Watters, co-host: [laughs] Dana Perino: -- incessantly to drive people crazy. I mean, a 900 dollar bottle of wine is what Jesse has on his table every night. [laughter] Juan Williams: Oh. Jesse Watters: I think Greg is the guy. Greg Gutfeld, co-host: All right. Liz was just mad because she only uses that wine teepee. Jesse Watters: Oh. Juan Williams: Oh, there you go. Dana Perino: Well. Yes. [laughter] This is what I understand about this debate from Elizabeth Warren. So basically, what she's saying is this. She has disavowed doing big fundraisers, okay? Now, this is after she ran for Senate and raised 10.5 million dollars from big donors that she then put it towards her campaign. And she's complaining that something like Mayor Pete has gained some support from big donors and is taking that money. But nobody, nobody, except for a very small percentage of people, cares about campaign finance reform as long as it's disclosed as to who is donating. So, she wastes all of this time talking about this. I thought that he was getting attacked because he has risen in the polls while she has declined ever since for Medicare for All. And I think that it showed that he was well able to fight back. I thought one of the best lines of the night was when he's talked about the purity tests and the problem with them, especially if you can't even pass the test that you put out there, which she has done. And I think that he also made another good point. If you plan to beat President Trump in 2020, you have to deal with the fact that the Republicans are awash in cash. Jesse just mentioned right before the show we saw that the president raised 10 million dollars in this week -- Jesse Watters: Forty-eight hours. Dana Perino: -- or something. In 48 hours after impeachment? You're going to have to have as much money in order to try to beat him unless you have Bloomberg, who's financing his own. Juan Williams: So, Jesse, watching the debate. The thing that stood out to me was Joe Biden. Best in show, best performance that I've seen from him on the debate stage yet. What did you think? Jesse Watters: I agree. He had his best debate, but his previous debates were so bad, by not screwing up that badly, he had his best debate. It's a low bar. He was steadier. He said less bizarre things. He still said crazy things, for instance, I think one person said, you know, ""Are you just going to throw, like, hundreds of thousands manufacturing jobs in order to go green?” And he said, ""Yeah."". Juan Williams: Yeah. Jesse Watters: I mean, you put that in an ad, and that's just death. Dana Perino: Did you see how they try to fix that today? Jesse Watters: How'd they spin it? Dana Perino: They said. So, Peter Doocy was out on the trail, and he asked the Biden people, ""Did he mean, really, it's OK to get rid of all these hundreds of thousands of jobs in order for the environment to be better? And they, ""No, no, no. What he meant was because he's going to improve the environment, there will be additional hundreds of thousands of jobs."" Jesse Watters: Wait, are those those green jobs that Obama promised. Dana Perino: These are green jobs. Jesse Watters: Yes, those are those green jobs. Besides that, he had a steady night. That's fine. I was surprised everyone piled on Pete. I thought he showed he has a chin, and he countered effectively. He was well prepared. It's weird to go after someone on a wine cave. Dana Perino: Yeah. Jesse Watters: I just. That line of attack was kind of cheap and a little corny and telegraphed, and she walked right into it. I mean, she's worth, what, 10 million dollars. She's, as you've said, taken money from lots of lots of rich people. Why would you disarm? It's like unilateral disarmament. Trumps awash, I like that word, awash with cash. And you're going to say, ""No, no, no, no. A billionaire's money's dirty because the guy is a billionaire."" What if the billionaire is a radical left-wing Democrat that hates Trump more than you do? You're not going to take his cash? Like most Democrat ideas, it doesn't make any sense. Juan Williams: Well, I just think you're not sensitive to the idea that, at the moment, populist left wing politics does not embrace millionaires and billionaires in an era where we have lots of plutocrats. Jesse Watters: I think the most important thing to Democrats is winning and beating Donald Trump. Juan Williams: I agree with that. Jesse Watters: And if you make it harder to win, I think that's bad politics. Juan Williams: I think so. So, this is the Christmas season, Gregory. Greg Gutfeld: Oh, yay. Juan Williams: And did you notice that the last question, I get say this for you, was about what you would give the other members of the party on the debate stage. And Andrew Yang, one of your favorites, said he'd give him his book. I was thinking maybe you'd be generous. Greg Gutfeld: Yeah. That was actually. That wasn't his best answer. I liked what he had to say, and I liked the question on nuclear power. That was interesting. On PBS. On PBS, which stands for pretty boring stuff, was pretty interesting. I don't know. I felt like it was the whole thing. Covering this debate seemed so anticlimactic. Emily Compagno, guest co-host: Yep. Greg Gutfeld: Right? Because you're in the shadow of Trump. You're in the shadow of impeachment, and you feel like you're watching like a high school theater troupe taking a tour of the model U.N. Right. Everything seems so small. However, I did find that I genuinely liked a couple of the people more the more that they talked. I thought Amy Klobuchar did good and I think Biden did OK. You can feel that you're comfortable around these people. But Trump just keeps changing our perspective on things, whether it's our relationship with our allies, impeachment or even the Democratic field. Everything just seems so, so different. I was troubled by the fact that they keep talking about our world in peril. We have Trump -- troops that are returning safely to a country where they have jobs. I mean, this is a great time to be alive and to be in America. I think that's a challenge for them because they can't instill the fear in us that they, you know, they would love to. I wanted to talk about the wine cave. Juan Williams: Sure. Greg Gutfeld: But I guess I'll stop. Juan Williams: No, you can come back to it. Jesse Watters: To your point about the economic message, joe Biden was vice president for eight years, and now he's up there saying the middle class is getting slaughtered? Greg Gutfeld: Yeah, it's crazy. Jesse Watters: You were there for eight years, and now you're running on helping the middle class because they're slaughtered? Well, what the hell was he doing? And in fact, the middle class isn't getting slaughtered. This is a bottom up recovery. And he doesn't even know the truth. Juan Williams: Well, I mean, that's an interesting point because I was struck by the fact that it was consistent among all the Democrats said, ""You know what? If you go out on the campaign trail, so many people struggling not only with paying health care bills, but paying just basic education bills, paying for the groceries."" Jesse Watters: There's a CNN poll says 76 percent of Americans think the economy's great. And 60 percent say they're better off after these three years. Emily Compagno: All right, Emily. Dana Perino: Do we have time to find out about the wine came, though? Juan Williams: What do you mean? Dana Perino: I want to know what you think about the wine cave. Greg Gutfeld: No, I want to hear Emily. Emily. Emily Compagno: I'll be fast. So, I just wanted to speak about that moment between Bernie and Amna when she asked about race and he answered in response about climate change. And she said, you know, with all due respect, I asked you about race. And to me, that was a metaphor for the Democratic Party right now, which is that voices are asking to be heard in a certain way and those on top and the establishment, Democrats included and especially are saying, ""Oh, no, honey. Shh, shh. Let me tell you what's really important. Let me tell you what you need to care about."" I thought it was that perfect symbolic moment. I think Yang continues to shine in that he's the best issue spotter on that stage. He continues to me to demonstrate that he's not presidential. But he's absolutely like at the top of answering in these relatable issues that gets to the point that the other ones who are kind of continuing to bring about their same talking points, the same lunch buffet of issues that they care about, you know, exactly every time they open their mouth what they're going to say. And that's not the case with him. And, just as a reminder, you guys; Gabbard, Booker, Castro, Bloomberg, Bennett, Delaney, Patrick, and Williamson are still in the race. Jesse Waters: They are? [CROSSTALK] Juan Williams: Amy Klobuchar, I think had a great debate. Did you think that? Dana Perino: You always say that. And I don't -- I never feel that -- Jesse Waters: He's got a thing for her. He loves her. Greg Gutfeld: What the hell are you talking about? [CROSSTALK] Greg Gutfeld: Did you notice, though, did you notice with Bernie Sanders said, he just yelled, ""I'm white."" And then he went like this. Juan Williams: I missed that. [CROSSTALK] So what's the wine cave thing? Greg Gutfeld: I can't remember what it was. [CROSSTALK] Greg Gutfeld: It was something about -- Juan Williams: You were in the wine cave. Greg Gutfeld: A wine cave can be anywhere. Like -- all you gotta do, get a bottle of wine and then put the blanket over your head. That's my wine cave. Juan Williams: Yeah. You know what it is? It's a basement where you keep some wine. Greg Gutfeld: Exactly. Jesse Waters: All right. A big debate brewing -- Juan Williams: Brewing, what a word right now. Jesse Waters: -- Over whether President Trump was actually impeached, as Nancy Pelosi. delays sending articles of impeachment to the Senate. Stay with us. Stay with the fun on The Five. [COMMERCIAL BREAK] Jesse Waters: Trump impeachment insanity never ends, for the media and the Democrats. They're hammering Republicans while giving a pass to Nancy Pelosi after she punted on sending articles of impeachment to the Senate. Here's the media trashing Trump. [begin video] Ari Melber: President Trump woke up today with a mark he will carry for the rest of his life. Female Reporter: The kind of stain -- John King: It's an indelible stain on the record, the legacy of Donald Trump. Rachel Maddow: You are not asleep. This is not a dream. This is really happening. Female Reporter: President Donald Trump is impeached. Jeffrey Toobin: President Trump was impeached for one reason; because he deserved it. [end video] Jesse Waters: This comes as one of the Democrats impeachment witnesses. Remember this guy? He says Trump won't actually be impeached until the articles go to the Senate. And Chuck Schumer is now claiming the delay is good for Democrats. [begin video] Chuck Schumer: I think it's a good idea to not draw a line in the sand and she hasn't done it. But to say let's wait, let's see what how things evolve in the Senate. And that's -- I think that's working well. We will show that this trial and the no vote on impeaching Trump and throwing him out of office is really not based on any fact, not based on any evidence, is a sham. So, it's sort of a win-win. [end video] Jesse Waters: Maybe you can explain it to me. I just don't understand the strategy here. Dana Perino: I've been trying to because I know that the Speaker is a strategic thinker and she's a good leader and she's shrewd, she's wise. And I'm trying to figure out -- what does she know that we don't know, where she thinks that this is a good idea? Maybe there is something. I do wonder, though, just regardless if it's a good idea for them politically, it might just be good for the nation. It's like we need a circuit breaker for two weeks. Like stop, let everybody -- Jesse Waters: Enjoy Christmas. Dana Perino: -- Have a good holiday, have a good New Year, and then come back and fight at the end of that at the end of the holiday season. I mean, that's no what -- I don't think that's a strategic reason she's not sending it over. If it was a slam dunk case, it would already be over. It would already be obvious. It's clearly not. And I think that the scarlet eye of impeachment, as the 9 p.m. host of MSNBC said, basically, it's like, ""You're not asleep,"" and it's almost like they woke up on Christmas morning. He got impeached. It was just what they always wanted. And now they have that. And maybe they don't even care about it going to the Senate. Jesse Waters: Yeah, they just wanted to call Impeachmas-- Greg Gutfeld: What they're doing is, they're trying -- they want their cake and they want to eat it, too. I coined that. [CROSSTALK] They want to accuse Trump and brand him with impeachment, without having to go to court. They want to indict without a trial because they know they'll lose. And that -- the thing is, it goes back to that question that I raised yesterday. Why would you be happy if you knew that you have lost? It's because it wasn't ever about justice. It wasn't about politics. It was about making Orange Monster feel bad. And make all of his supporters feel bad. And that is how you feel good. That's what people -- the little spring in your step, BS. It is purely an emotional act, and I have to think that the supporters and the fans of MSNBC and CNN, when they wake up, to Christmas and they expected a puppy, and they got a chemistry set, and they're looking and they go, is that all there is? They're going to feel mad. And that's what they're -- and again, they're going to have these viewers and these fans leave them because you going to be betrayed the way they were betrayed over Covington and Kavanaugh and collusion. This is number four. Jesse Waters: The high can only last so long. Right, Emily? Greg Gutfeld: Tell me about it. Emily Compagno: Totally. Yes. I have such a hard time with Schumer saying, let's see how things evolve. I need specificity. I need an articulation. And that is what the president needs too. That's what any defendant is entitled to, constitutionally, and also, all of us. So, I feel like your -- what does your expression mean? [CROSSTALK] Juan Williams: It's not like a civil or criminal trials. It's impeachment. Emily Compagno: That's why it's so difficult for us to comprehend in the way that they are doing this. The lack of articulation is just hoarding that strategy, that information. But what about the millions of us that are watching our president be impeached and then a bunch of people on the Hill who are elected to those positions, not explain to us what the heck is going on? Greg Gutfeld: Okay, you know what it's like? As you said it's not a court -- this is just like the modern-day court of public opinion with social media. They want to cancel you without ever having to actually do the work. Emily Compagno: Right. And without it being this consistent application that we can -- Greg Gutfeld: Yeah. Emily Compagno: -- follow along with. Meanwhile, you guys thought Noah Feldman saying, ""By the way, he's not actually impeached until you do pass the article.” Greg Gutfeld: Right. Emily Compagno: So, this is kind of -- this is like when you celebrate your touchdown prematurely and then guess what happened? Dana Perino: Oh wow. Emily Compagno: And also -- Dana Perino: And then you took a selfie and you get fined. Greg Gutfeld: Yes. Dana Perino: That's what happened. Emily Compagno: And then I just think it's also such a backfire for Pelosi. We don't yet know the positives of her strategy, but we know all of the negatives, including those senators that are campaigning that are also supposed to be jurors. Dana Perino: [affirmative] Jesse Watters: Maybe -- Emily Compagno: It's a win-win for Trump no matter what if it goes. Jesse Watters: Maybe she delays it so much, McConnell just holds the trial during the Iowa caucus. Greg Gutfeld: [affirmative] Juan Williams: I don't think that be so good for President Trump. But let me just say -- Jesse Watters: Why not? Juan Williams: -- I think today what you saw is all the right wing's websites, ""Oh, well, maybe he's not really impeached."" This was evidence of desperation and a fantasy. I mean, it's just -- it's so sad -- Dana Perino: Not really. Juan Williams: -- because it's very clear -- Jesse Watters: Juan, your own witness said it. Juan Williams: Excuse -- no. I think everybody -- Jesse Watters: Constitutional scholar. Emily Compagno: [laughs] Juan Williams: Your own witness, Jonathan Turley, said, ""It's very clear that the Congress has voted two articles of impeachment"" but people are desperate and -- Jesse Watters: Yeah, they voted it. Dana Perino: So now you like Turley. Okay. Juan Williams: You know what this is like? Jesse Watters: Yes? Juan Williams: This is just like President Trump now trolling somebody. They're trolling him. Nancy Pelosi is thoroughly under his skin. Senator Graham came out of the White House last night. He said, ""Oh, yeah, the president is very upset, very upset"" because the president wants a Senate show trial or something where he can then be acquitted, and then he can go out and stay on the campaign trail, ""This was just those Democrats going after me."" But the real one -- Jesse Watters: Juan. Juan Williams: Let me finish here, Jesse. The real one is that today you saw Christianity Today go after President Trump say, ""He definitely should be impeached. Evangelicals, wake up.” Jesse Watters: Wow. Juan Williams: And what did Trump do? He again went bananas. He started tweeting about -- Greg Gutfeld: Okay. Juan Williams: -- ""Christianity Today, I'm not reading it. It's not ""-- [CROSSTALK] Greg Gutfeld: All right. I love it this part. Whenever Trump responsed to anything, it's like, ""Oh, my God, he's lost his mind."" He's doing it casually, and I love -- Juan Williams: Casually? Greg Gutfeld: Yes. Juan Williams: How's it casual? Greg Gutfeld: He's -- by the way. Jesse Watters: He's tweeting on -- Greg Gutfeld: It's probably one of the strongest weeks he's had in policy. He's actually can chew gum and actually get pissed off at the same time, unlike the Democrats. But you brought up Christianity Today. I want to salute the media for the first time ever caring about a religious opinion that they didn't openly mock. Is that interesting? Usually they, like, they laugh at Evangelicals. They think they're stupid. Now they're kissing your butt because you actually agree with them. No, but you should be very suspicious of -- Dana Perino: Christianity Today -- Juan Williams: Christianity Today -- Jesse Watters: Juan -- Juan Williams: -- has been a leading publication on -- Jesse Watters: -- you don't get the last word. Greg Gutfeld: [laughs] Juan Williams: -- civil rights, for example, for a long time. Jesse Watters: Okay. Yeah, you have him right where you want him, don't you, Juan? Juan Williams: Yeah. Jesse Watters: Sure, you do. Coming up -- Juan Williams: He just got impeached. Greg Gutfeld: [laughs] Jesse Watters: -- it's a new -- not according to -- Dana Perino: Not yet. Greg Gutfeld: [laughs] Jesse Watters: The media smear, the West Point Cadets accused of being racist. They just got that cleared. Stay tuned. [COMMERCIAL BREAK] Dana Perino: Military officials have wrapped up an investigation into controversial hand gestures seen during last weekend's Army Navy football game. Officials finding cadets were playing a game and not flashing white power symbols. A story now drawing comparison to the Covington High School controversy over the media coverage. Here's a look of some of it. [BEGIN VIDEO CLIP] Male Speaker: Students from both West Point and the Naval Academy under scrutiny for flashing what looked like a white power symbol on live TV. Male Speaker: The symbol looks like an upside down okay sign, but it often is used offensively. Female Speaker: Yeah, like by white supremacist groups to indicate white power. Female Speaker: Cadets at the game flashed this hand gesture, which is widely known as the white power symbol. Male Speaker: The hand gesture is not a joke. White supremacists latched onto it, not as a symbol of irony, but as a symbol of their prevalence. Male Speaker: Whether they're playing this game, they had to know it could be interpreted as this white power symbol. [END VIDEO CLIP] Dana Perino: So, this investigation took place pretty quickly, and I actually was following on Twitter the day it broke, Jesse, and Congressman Dan Crenshaw said this could be just the circle game. And then you said the circle game. I didn't even know anything about a circle game. But apparently that's been going on for about 40 years. Jesse Watters: Yeah, the circle game is when you put the little thing down there and then someone sees it, you get to punch him in the arm. I explained that to Juan, Juan accused them of being white supremacists. Juan Williams: I didn't accuse. I said that's -- Jesse Watters: I would like -- Juan Williams: -- a dangerous symbol at a time -- Jesse Watters: Juan -- Juan Williams: -- when white supremacy is on move in this country. Jesse Watters: -- to apologize -- Emily Compagno: [laughs] Juan Williams: Oh, Jesse. Jesse Watters: -- for accusing the cadets of using a white power symbol. Juan Williams: Jesse, let me tell you something. Jesse Watters: That doesn't sound like an apology. Juan Williams: It's not because -- Jesse Watters: Juan. Juan Williams: Jesse, we were very clear in saying that that symbol is now associated with white supremacy. Greg Gutfeld: It's not. Jesse Watters: Let me tell you something, Juan. If all of a sudden a dozen white supremacists started wearing a blue tie, and the next day, I wore a blue tie -- Juan Williams: Jesse. Jesse Watters: -- am I flashing a white supremacist symbol? Juan Williams: Jesse, I'm so disappointed. Jesse Watters: No. That's ridiculous. Juan Williams: Jesse, I'm disappointed because you are trying to minimize -- Jesse Watters: I'm disappointed in you. Juan Williams: -- a very dangerous trend in America society. Jesse Watters: I've never seen this white power symbol. Juan Williams: Right. Jesse Watters: I ever know that to be a white power symbol. Juan Williams: Okay, so what about Pepe the frog? Greg Gutfeld: That's made up. Juan Williams: What about the frog? Jesse Watters: Are you talking about a cartoon? Greg Gutfeld: Yes. Jesse Watters: Juan, I wasn't even going to get upset. Juan Williams: Oh, okay. Jesse Watters: But you accused these people of being racist. Juan Williams: I did not accuse. I said -- Jesse Waters: Down the line for this country, and you said they were racists -- Juan Williams: I did not. Jesse Waters: -- because they made a symbol with their hands and you should apologize, because I'm giving you an opportunity. Juan Williams: No, because you're give me an opportunity as to point out how you will hype and distort something. But you know what? [CROSSTALK] Here's the thing. These kids were playing a game, according to the investigation. It was done very quickly, and it was found out to be what it is. [CROSSTALK] They said to the kids, don't do this because that's bad behavior. And they will be punished. Greg Gutfeld: Okay, let's -- first of all, it was at a football game where people like to have fun, and they were having fun. You can go back and say, okay, this all began as a hoax on 4chan. That's all it was. The tricked the media, they tricked people into thinking that that was the symbol. The problem is, it worked. Because the media wanted to believe this. The media is always looking for this. And that is the biggest story here, whether it's about Covington, whether it's about Justin Smollett, whether it's about anything that is supposed to be the story, the one that they have. It never is. It evaporates. So, this investigation was caused by social media turning a fake story into a phenomenon that was fanned by a bunch of people on Twitter. That then puts these kids lives in hell because now they're being called racist. There has to be some kind of retribution when a person is falsely called racist because it's a label that sticks forever. Case in point, this symbol is considered racist when for -- I don't know how long ""okay"" has been around, right. But it's the media that pushes this. Same with Pepe the Frog, which was ironically done just to sucker the media. And the media embraces it. Juan Williams: Yes, it's an excuse for people, then, adopting symbols to perpetuate racism. Greg Gutfeld: So, you're accusing them of that. There you go. [CROSSTALK]. Juan Williams: No, I'm saying that there was an investigation done. It was found that they were playing a game. I know -- [CROSSTALK] Dana Perino: -- I didn't know about the game. But, Emily -- Emily Compagno: I didn't know about the game, either. But I saw, in the media at the time, like they were actively giggling and laughing. So, it's kind of clear that they were jovial and having a good time. And what you were saying, you know, you're supposed to assume good intent -- Greg Gutfeld: Exactly. You can't mind read. Emily Compagno: Right. And when you're interacting with someone in person, like even if you start to find -- oh, did you really mean that? Assume good intent. With social media, and Twitter especially, is the opposite with the media these days. It's like assuming the worst intent, the automatic assumption of the worst possible scenario. However, you know, cadets are held to that highest standard. So, hopefully moving forward if there's any room for misinterpretation, but it's -- at the same time, all of them are still the -- I hate using the word ""victims"" but they are of this kind of rabid mob -- Dana Perino: The investigation looks like it was thorough. There's no question about it. And they were able to get it done before the holidays so you they go home and tough [inaudible. Juan Williams: I just -- again, they're being punished. Dana Perino: Well -- [CROSSTALK] Jesse Waters: Because they played the circle game. Juan Williams: No, because they acted in a way that was -- [CROSSTALK] Greg Gutfeld: -- Media attention from jackals in the press. [CROSSTALK]. Juan Williams: Oh, I see. It's not -- the jackals are not the white racists. That's the press. Greg Gutfeld: Thank God everything's okay. Jesse Waters: Juan, this is not a racist symbol. He just explained it was a hoax. You fell for it and so did the press. Juan Williams: It is a racist symbol. [CROSSTALK] [music playing] [COMMERCIAL BREAK] Emily Compagno: Welcome back. Time for the Fastest Seven. First up, political correctness making the holidays not so happy for one comedian. Whitney Cummings says she got reported to H.R. for saying this. [BEGIN VIDEO CLIP] Whitney Cummings: I was leaving like on the 18th or whatever today was, I was like, ""Bye, guys. Merry Christmas."" Like just a formality. What you would say, right? I come back, like June 6, H.R. calls me and they're like, ""Hey, we need to talk to you. One of the interns is pissed off that you said Merry Christmas."" And I was like, which, by the way, I was like, ""I don't even care how your Christmas was."" [END VIDEO CLIP] Emily Compagno: Juan, Merry Christmas. Juan Williams: Merry Christmas to you. I don't. I don't. Nobody's ever said anything to me about saying Merry Christmas, right? I don't understand this. I don't. At first, I was, is this real? And why did she come back in June? I don't get that. [laughter] Emily Compagno: Jesse, she says, you know, “Who am I to know that the intern was agnostic?"" The more information I learned proves my point that you should be able to say this common greeting because you don't know anything about the person. Jesse Watters: Yeah. Merry Christmas covers basically everything, and everybody knows it. Dana Perino: It's like good morning. Jesse Watters: Yeah. Exactly. It's like, good afternoon. We've been warning everybody that will listen about the war on Christmas, and how real it is. And all of a sudden, the war comes to Hollywood, and they're waking up to it. Well, we told you so, Hollywood. [laughter]. Dana Perino: I think H.R. should have told the intern, stop. Not a problem. They should've done that intern a favor because nobody wants to live their life in a verbal straitjacket. And H.R. has a responsibility not only to help protect people in the workplace, but also to tell younger people like this is not something you should be upset about. Move on. Emily Compagno: I like that phrase verbal straitjacket. Dana Perino: Thank you. I wrote it down right here. Greg Gutfeld: It's the name of my metal band. You know, I see through this. Kilmeade paid her off so she would do this so Fox & Friends could have a war on Christmas segment on Christmas Eve. I have a hard time believing this only because I just can't see an intern for a TV show. I believe it was Roseanne, right? It was the Roseanne TV show? Would go to H R over this. If you're an intern on a TV show, unless you're like a maniacal busybody, you would not jeopardize those relationships and moving up the ladder and getting a job for something like this. This seems like a story that has been kind of like exaggerated or joked about and then suddenly became believable. She might believe it happened, but I honestly, I cannot believe. Let put it -- I believe this is happening in a lot of companies, but not on a TV show where -- especially. Jesse Watters: Especially Roseanne. Emily Compagno: Right. Greg Gutfeld: Yes. Juan Williams: And also, wouldn't HR have called in six months before if there was a real issue? Greg Gutfeld: Yeah, that's true. Emily Compagno: Yeah. All right. The Navy pilot who filmed this now famous video of a UFO is speaking out. He says, quote, I was just behaving in ways -- ""It was just behaving in ways that aren't physically normal. That's what caught my eye, because aircraft, whether they're manned or unmanned, still have to obey the laws of physics."" You guys, I love this guy. I love this story. I love everything about this. I wish we had a whole block for this -- Greg Gutfeld: [laughs] Emily Compagno: -- because, first of all, did you guys hear the rest of his interview? Don't make that face. Greg Gutfeld: [laughs] Emily Compagno: They're amazing. And for example, one of the other guys that didn't speak to the press, the Hornet commander? Greg Gutfeld: Yeah? Emily Compagno: He then started working for the government basically in their UFO department -- Greg Gutfeld: No. Emily Compagno: -- for a guy who like privately funds -- Greg Gutfeld: Stop. Emily Compagno: -- UFO research. There is so much. Everyone I know that like even touches this slightly says there's so much to this that we don't know. And it's all true. Dana Perino: I don't believe it. Emily Compagno: And I know you don't believe it, but I do. Greg Gutfeld: No, no, no, no, I'll tell you why. Emily Compagno: We have to believe it. Greg Gutfeld: This is like the worst strip club. [laughter] You keep hearing these UFO stories, you keep hearing the same story over and over again. The footage is always really grainy, and you really can't tell what it is. And the guy's like, ""Oh, it's this and that so."" It's a good strip tease where you never really see anything. Jesse Watters: Like -- Dana Perino: [laughs] Greg Gutfeld: And this has been going on for decades. Jesse Watters: -- the Russia hoax, you know? Greg Gutfeld: Yeah. [laughter] Jesse Watters: They keep telling us there was collusion, then there was no collusion. Emily Compagno: No, I heard that they basically want us to destroy ourselves -- Greg Gutfeld: Yeah, an alien. Emily Compagno: Yes. The aliens are never going to come and really show their faces to us because we are clearly destroying ourselves and are annoying. Everyone hates us. Greg Gutfeld: How do you know I'm not an alien? Emily Compagno: You probably are. Greg Gutfeld: What -- I -- Juan Williams: [laughs] Emily Compagno: They hate us in the galaxy. Juan Williams: You didn't expect that. Emily Compagno: There's a reason I -- Greg Gutfeld: And I still my driver's license. Juan Williams: Really? Greg Gutfeld: [laughs] Dana Perino: I respect this guy and all he's done, but I also think that -- he says it's not behaving within the normal law of physics. Well, right, because it's an unidentified flying object. Why does it -- why does a UFO have to be under our laws of physics? Maybe they have their own laws of physics wherever they came from. Greg Gutfeld: Oh. Dana Perino: I don't believe any of it. Jesse Watters: Dana's a wingnut, I didn't see that -- Emily Compagno: Hey, you witnessed a UFO. Greg Gutfeld: Do you think we have physics privilege? Dana Perino: No. Emily Compagno: [laughs] Dana Perino: I'm trying to say, like, I -- Greg Gutfeld: Physics -- Dana Perino: Yeah, we have -- no. We don't have -- we are -- Greg Gutfeld: Physics privilege. Dana Perino: -- limited by our physics. Maybe the UFO people are not. Greg Gutfeld: Of course, there's probably another dimension. Dana Perino: They're not even people. Juan Williams: You know what -- Emily Compagno: Do you guys remember Edgar Allen, the astronaut from Apollo 14? He came back recognizing our collective conscious -- Dana Perino: Oh. Emily Compagno: -- and then he basically dedicated the rest of his life to paranormal activity. This is real. Juan, tell them. Greg Gutfeld: [laughs] Juan Williams: What? Emily Compagno: Yes. Tell them. Juan Williams: Well, anyway -- I just -- I never believe this stuff. Dana Perino: Yeah, I don't either. Juan Williams: And I do think, by the way, every time we do this story, guess what? It turns out to be a shadow, a bug out in the windshield -- Greg Gutfeld: A fly. Juan Williams: Right. Emily Compagno: No. Juan Williams: And I just -- it's just at some point -- Emily Compagno: Not this one. Greg Gutfeld: Not this one? [laughs] Juan Williams: This is Agent Scully right here. Dana Perino: [laughs] Greg Gutfeld: Yes. Emily Compagno: Yes. Juan Williams: I think it's just in some ways, it's a lot of fun, but it's not real. So, kids don't believe it. Believe in Santa, don't believe in this. Jesse Watters: Garbage. Greg Gutfeld: Maybe it was Santa. Juan Williams: It could have been. Greg Gutfeld: [laughs] Emily Compagno: All right. Finally. Ever feel like your dog knows when you're shortchanging her on treats? Brain scans reveal dogs can process numbers in a similar way to humans, and they even use the region of the brain that we use to do math. Dana Perino: I guess that must explain my math grades. [laughter] Emily Compagno: So, what do you guys think? Dana Perino: I think it's true. Emily Compagno: Of course. Yeah. Greg Gutfeld: Of course. [laughs] Emily Compagno: Dobermans are the smartest breed, obviously. By the way, Labradors have more emotions than psychopaths. Greg Gutfeld: [laughs] Juan Williams: What? Emily Compagno: Yes. Juan Williams: What does that mean? [laughter] Emily Compagno: Well, just -- I'm just saying that while we're talking about dogs, that psychopaths, i.e. sociopaths -- [laughs] Greg Gutfeld: Is that directed at Jesse? Jesse Watters: Why are you looking at me? Juan Williams: [laughs] Emily Compagno: They are devoid of emotions. Dogs have more emotions than -- Juan Williams: Wait a second. Wait a second. Wait a second. Emily Compagno: Dogs are great. Juan Williams: Wait, but a dog has limited capacities is what you're saying? Greg Gutfeld: [laughs] Emily Compagno: Well, right. But that -- Jesse Watters: Juan. Emily Compagno: -- interestingly, they have more -- Jesse Watters: Let it go. Emily Compagno: -- emotions than -- Juan Williams: Let it go? Dana Perino: Yeah. Let's go. Juan Williams: Okay. [laughter] Emily Compagno: I'm too scientific for this group, obviously. All right. Stay right where you are, Fan Mail Friday, is next? So obviously, psychopaths have -- [COMMERCIAL BREAK] Greg Gutfeld: Yeah. I do want to be sedated. Dana Perino: [laughs] Greg Gutfeld: It's fan mail Friday, we're answering your questions, first one. This is actually really good question because I've thought about this. How long have you ever held a grudge? Emily, I bet you hold grudges. Emily Compagno: Forever. I'm Sicilian. [laughter] No, just kidding. I mean, but yeah. Jesse Watters: But yeah? Greg Gutfeld: Anyone in particular? Anyone in particular? Emily Compagno: You know who it is. Jesse Watters: Oh. Greg Gutfeld: Oh. Emily Compagno: I'm kidding. I'm kidding. No, I don't -- I mean -- Dana Perino: I know who it is. It's that girl. Emily Compagno: What? Greg Gutfeld: What girl? Dana Perino: The one you told us about the commercial break yesterday. Emily Compagno: [laughs] Greg Gutfeld: [laughs] Look at that smile. Dana Perino: That you never talked to again. Greg Gutfeld: Oh. Jesse Watters: Oh, the one they took the fall for? Dana Perino: [laughs] Greg Gutfeld: Jesus is great. Emily Compagno: Anyway, next person. Greg Gutfeld: Juan? Juan Williams: [laughs] Jesse Watters: Did I say too much? [laughter] Emily Compagno: Thank you, Jesse. Greg Gutfeld: Oh, we're all get sued. Juan? Juan Williams: I don't engage in grudges. I get angry. I get frustrated. Greg Gutfeld: [affirmative] Juan Williams: But I really don't hold grudges. You know, I'm just like last night where the two women on the stage at the debate said -- Greg Gutfeld: Yeah. Juan Williams: -- they ask for forgiveness for, you know, being a little bit too aggressive. So I get angry. I get upset. But I don't -- you know, I remember once when I was a college basketball player and people would -- there was one guy in practice on my team, just beat the living daylights out of me every day in practice because he's bigger. He was physically wider. And then this time of year, Christmas season, he invited me home for dinner. Do I want to go over to New Jersey to have dinner? And his mom served manicotti. Greg Gutfeld: Oh. Juan Williams: And I'd never had manicotti. Greg Gutfeld: [laughs] Juan Williams: I thought it was the most delicious meal I've ever had. Greg Gutfeld: Oh, there you go. Dana Perino: My mouth is watering. Greg Gutfeld: Yes. Jesse? Jesse Watters: I'm going to start bringing manicotti on set. [laughter] That's all it takes, Juan. Juan Williams: I'm -- that would help. Greg Gutfeld: You've been to -- Juan Williams: Wait a minute. Wait, your mom is not Italian. Jesse Watters: No, no, no, no. But I can microwave something. Greg Gutfeld: [laughs] Jesse Watters: I don't hold grudges, but people hold grudges against me. Greg Gutfeld: Yes. [laughter] Jesse Watters: I currently know at least three people that are holding like hardcore grudges against me. [laughter] Emily Compagno: Amazing. [laughs] Greg Gutfeld: I bet there's more. Jesse Watters: At least three. Greg Gutfeld: There's probably -- [CROSSTALK] Jesse Watters: I think there's actually four that I can name -- Greg Gutfeld: Yeah. Jesse Watters: -- right now off the top of my head. Greg Gutfeld: In this company. [laughter] Jesse Watters: No, not in this company. Maybe there's -- no I can't name that person here. Is there someone here? Greg Gutfeld: I don't know. We'll talk later. Jesse Watters: Okay. Greg Gutfeld: Dana? Dana Perino: I have a -- Greg Gutfeld: You hold grudges. Dana Perino: Not really. But – Greg Gutfeld: You hold grudges. Dana Perino: Not really, but there is a reporter -- I don't forget. So, there's a reporter who wrote something in 2008, and it was about George W. Bush, and he had told me the whole time, I think the president's getting a really raw deal. I want to write the story before he leaves office -- this is 2009, sorry, January '09 -- I think he's gotten a raw deal. So, we participated, we went out of our way. He wrote the meanest piece I've ever seen. And he has been in the deep freeze ever since. And you know exactly who you are, and I know where you work -- [CROSSTALK] Dana Perino: -- And you're still in the deep freeze. I told my staff, no one ever talks to him for the rest of his life. Emily Compagno: Yes Dana. Greg Gutfeld: See, I don't have to hold any grudges because my wife does it. Like I have -- I have like two semi-grudges that I am willing to completely forgive and forget. I've already moved on, but my wife tells me that if I ever talk to this person, she will kill me. So, she is like -- because she's Russian. The Russians, they just -- like, she goes no, what he did was bad. So, you may forgive him, but I won't. But Elena, you never met him. Jesse Waters: And guys can get over stuff. You know, like -- Emily Compagno: Peter holds a grudge against somebody for me. I can let it go. I'm fine. Juan Williams: I think you're exactly right. That's what my wife does. And she's black. [laughter] Greg Gutfeld: I don't even know what to say to that. Do we have time or should we move on? One more question. This is -- this question is too hard. Do you have a favorite line from a movie? Yes? Go. Dana Perino: [whispers] I don't know. Greg Gutfeld: [laughter] That was great. That's great. That's the silent movie. [CROSSTALK] Juan Williams: I have a couple, I think. Midnight Cowboy, ""I'm walking here."" Greg Gutfeld: Classic movie. Juan Williams: I like that. ""I'll be back."" Yeah, yeah? Greg Gutfeld: The one I like, I can't say because it's Dennis Hopper, Frank Booth from Blue Velvet. And if you like Blue Velvet, you know exactly the line I'm talking about. One more thing is up next. I've crossed that line. [music playing] [COMMERCIAL BREAK] Juan Williams: It's time for one more thing. Jesse Watters. Jesse Watters: So, our friend Ed Henry got a big promotion. Yeah. Ed Henry. Greg Gutfeld: Boo. Jesse Watters: Starting later next month. Greg Gutfeld: Hate him. Jesse Watters: Is going to be co-anchoring America's newsroom from 9:00 to noon with Sandra Smith and you can see him three hours a day. That's a lot of Henry. I don't know if he is ready for this, but here we go. Greg Gutfeld: So now we know how to get a get a promotion. You got to donate part of your liver. Jesse Watters: Yeah, that's asking a lot of people. Also, you know, this is like the second biggest job Ed's gotten recently because I promoted Ed to officiate my wedding. Greg Gutfeld: Oh my God. Jesse Watters: So, he's going to be doing that as well. A lot on Ed's plate. Let's be honest. Got no pressure. Juan Williams: You thought he was a minister Reverend Henry I don't think so. But by the way. Jesse Watters: Just don't report me to HR. Juan Williams: He will do a great job for you. Jesse Watters: I'm sure he will. Greg Gutfeld: Hey, move it on man I want to close my show. Jesse Watters: 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time an impeachment explosion, implosion explosion. Female Speaker: Implosion. Jesse Watters: We're working on. Juan Williams: All right here we go. We all know that Santa is making his list and checking it twice but if you're a toddler and you're hanging out in Vegas, why not have some fun? So, take a look at this. Yeah, that's right that 2-year-old slipped away from mom and got himself trapped in a ski ball machine. Female Speaker: Ouch. Juan Williams: He clung to rim of the five-thousand-point hole. Apparently, this may be a trend earlier this year, if you remember in New Jersey, a 2 year old guy also got stuck in an arcade game. Our ski ball loving friend definitely deserves a big Christmas gift for being a go getter. Jesse Watters: Great parenting. Juan Williams: Dana. Dana Perino: You want to go next? Greg Gutfeld: No, you go. Dana Perino: Are you sure? Greg Gutfeld: It's two and a half minutes. Dana Perino: The annual Jasper calendar is out here we are here we are. Here you go. Jesse. Emily. Juan. Greg sells his on eBay if you want to grab one. Greg Gutfeld: I will sell it on eBay, and I'll sign it. Dana Perino: So, it's 2020 and like a lot of space things. Emily Compagno: Oh, yay little wiggly. Jesse Watters: Nice. All right this is cool. Emily Compagno: Thanks Dana. Juan Williams: All right, Gregory. Greg Gutfeld: All right. Tomorrow night, Greg Gutfeld show, Saturday, 10:00. It's great you got Dr. Drew you got Katie Hyde You got Kat Timpf and Tyrus. You got to watch this show it's going to kick some butt and now we got one of these to end the week. Jesse Watters: You don't have to play the -- it's gong to leave Emily with ten seconds. Greg Gutfeld: You know what check out these sea lions. These guys don't give a damn about where they go. Female Speaker: Oh my gosh. Greg Gutfeld: Imagine being on that boat freeloading sea lions in Olympia, Washington. They're known as stellar sea lions. They weigh about 2400 pounds each. Bunch of freeloaders that's what they are. Oh, Democrats. So true Jesse. Emily Compagno: There are so fat. Greg Gutfeld: You know, fat shaming. Emily is not part of The Five. Jesse Watters: It's blubber. Greg Gutfeld: I will have you get up and leave now. No one more thing for you. Juan Williams: Oh, no but give her a chance. Greg Gutfeld: Okay. Juan Williams: It's the Christmas season Emily. Emily Compagno: I get two. Happy birthday, sweet Vinney's, number one. Number two, the Franklin Police Department in Massachusetts learned that they had a thief in their midst. Well, watch as their dog, Ben Franklin, ran off with one of their Toys for Tots and their Christmas program. Literally. Greg Gutfeld: Literally. Emily Compagno: He makes a run for it. It's hilarious the video has gone viral. Greg Gutfeld: Literally. Emily Compagno: So adorable,. Greg Gutfeld: Literally. Emily Compagno: The police department, however, is letting this one slide literally. Juan Williams: Final point. Emily Compagno: Final point it behooves all of us. There's just a long list, isn't there? Greg Gutfeld: Yes there is. Juan Williams: Greg where are you going for Christmas? Greg Gutfeld: I am I'm going to be here.
