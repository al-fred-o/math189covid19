0,CNN," According to at least one of those reports, the reason is partially the relaxation of social distancing guidelines. That report comes from an institute at the University of Washington, whose modeling has been cited by the White House, and its director is going to join us shortly, in a moment.  Dr. Chris Murray says, quote, ""This rise of mobility in the last week or ten days is likely leading to some increased transmission."" This is what the rise in mobility looks like: all of this from the weekend.  Take a look at what happened in Panama City Beach in Florida. As you can see, people at the beach are heading to the beach. There they are on the beach, clearly not respecting social distancing guidelines.  You can find a similar situation at the National Mall in the nation's capital. Crowds enjoying the weather, some wearing masks, many not wearing them. New Yorkers also took advantage of the beautiful spring weather to go to Central Park.  The other study that shows a spike in deaths and caseloads was conducted for the government, that was first reported by ""The New York Times."" Now, the White House and CDC have disavowed the numbers, however, the ""Times"" and ""The Washington Post"" report that slides created from the report carried the CDC logo on them. Also, that the numbers come from modeling conducted by Johns Hopkins University.  Now, in both reports, cases are projected to spike, with the death count rising sharply.  Last night President Trump tried to say that, quote, ""Everything is working out,"" unquote, even as he upped his own estimate. Two weeks ago today he projected deaths between 50,000 to 60,000; last night he said it would be 75,000 to 100,000.  However, a member of the president's coronavirus task force, Dr. Deborah Birx, appeared to contradict the president's projections, all of them. Quoting Dr. Birx, quote, ""Our projections have always been between 100,000 and 240,000 American lives lost.""  So we want to start this hour with Nick Watt, who joins us from Los Angeles.  So, restrictions are going to ease at the end of the week in California. What's life expected to start to look like there in the near-term?  NICK WATT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, in the near-term, Anderson, probably not a lot of change, I've got to be honest with you.  Listen, we were among the first people in the country told to stay home. That's going to be 50 days ago come Friday, when the governor is finally going to start lifting these restrictions.  He's been under a lot of pressure over the closing of the beaches. He's had three counties say that they're going to defy his orders and just open their businesses anyway.  But he says this has nothing to do with politics: these decisions are driven purely by the science. And, actually, he said, you know, local areas, local municipalities can move faster or slower, if the data really supports it, than his statewide guidelines.  And already we've heard from the mayor of San Francisco, who says that her city might need a little bit more time. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WATT (voice-over): Today, restaurants can reopen in Nebraska and Florida, bars in Montana, offices in Colorado. Yes, some social distancing restrictions remain, but by the end of this week more than 40 states will be partially back open for business.  ANDY SLAVITT, FORMER ACTING ADMINISTRATOR, CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES: Well, we've been staying indoors; we have been slowing down the spread. But what we haven't done is gotten rid of the virus.  WATT (voice-over): This is what new normal looks like. Eating in Texas, complete with masks. In Miami Beach today they had to close the popular South Point Park again, after police issued 7,300 warnings to people not wearing masks.  The projected number of deaths forecast by early August in this country just nearly doubled, to more than 134,000 in that well-known model from the University of Washington. The reason?  ALI MOKDAD, PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON: It's one of them is increased mobility before the relaxation, premature relaxation of social distancing. We're adding more presumptive deaths as well, and we're seeing a lot of outbreaks, in the Midwest, for example.  WATT (voice-over): Another model used by the administration projects a sharp rise in deaths, to around 3,000 a day by June 1st, according to sources; and a rough eight-fold increase in the number of new cases every day nationwide. Now, in 15 states, the daily new case count is falling. Among them, those northeast hot spots.  GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D), NEW YORK: You see the decline is, again, not as steep as the incline, but reopening is more difficult than the close down.  WATT (voice-over): But in 20 states the daily new case count is still rising. Among them, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois.  The Governor of California will now allow some retail to open Friday, with significant modifications. He says certain areas of lower concern can move even faster.  GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D), CALIFORNIA: We will afford them that right with conditions and modifications that meet the health needs of the entire state.  [20:05:00] WATT (voice-over): Meanwhile, the White House is now focusing on 14 potential vaccines.  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We are very confident that we're going to have a vaccine at the end of the year.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Miracles can happen. It could come together. But I'm certainly not banking on it.  WATT (voice-over): The makers of that potential therapeutic, remdesivir, say they have now donated 140,000 courses to the federal government.  DANIEL O'DAY, CEO, GILIAD SCIENCES: They will determine, based upon things like ICU beds, where the course of the epidemic is in the United States. They will begin shipping tens of thousands of treatment courses out early this week.  WATT (voice-over): And today in D.C. history was made.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oyez! Oyez! Oyez! All persons having business before the honorable, the Supreme Court of the United States are admonished to give their attention.  WATT (voice-over): That's the Supreme Court, for the first time ever meeting by teleconference.  (END VIDEOTAPE) COOPER: Nick, the White House is pushing back on the projections that are reported today. What did they say?  WATT: Yes, pushing back strongly against the projection, Anderson, that says that we're going to have 3,000 deaths a day by June 1st. And we're going to see the daily case count increasing eightfold.  They are pushing back heavily. We just got the statement from Judd Deere, White House spokesperson. This is not a White House document, nor has it been presented to the coronavirus task force or gone through inter-agency vetting.  This data is not reflective of any of the modeling done by the task force or data that the task force has analyzed. Make of that what you will. Anderson?  COOPER: Nick Watt. Nick, thanks very much. Our Chief Medical Chief Correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta joins us now. Sanjay, I want to get to specific numbers in a moment, but just in terms of what we're seeing and what we're hearing, clearly people eager to get back to some sort of version of normal. Are things happening too fast?  DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: They seem to be, Anderson. There was these gating criteria that were put forward by the White House, somewhat general, but still, you know, saying 14-day downward trend that you needed in cases.  That was to sort of give some evidence that things were, you know, objectively going in the right direction. And most of the states that -- many of the states that are opening the week, that have opened over the last week, did not meet those criteria.  Many of them had their peak just over the last few days, so I think it's too fast. I think the reality is, any time things start to open, given that there is a contagious virus out there, there are going to be people who become infected, as you and I have talked about -- people who would become infected that otherwise wouldn't if we weren't open.  I think it's just a question of how many, you know. There's all these different models out there. The scenario that Nick Watt was just talking about was a scenario, you know, that -- some version of that's been out there for some time. but there are other scenarios as well.  Right now, I think it's pretty clear that we aren't getting better in terms of the overall numbers of cases every day. We're sort of plateaued. Maybe not necessarily getting worse, but not getting better. Not coming off the back end of that curve.  COOPER: In the new government number, the slides with the CDCs logo on them which were obtained by ""The New York Times"" first, they project a rise to 3,000 deaths a day in the U.S. by June 1st.  I know the White House is disputing those numbers. They say those aren't White House numbers. They weren't presented to the coronavirus task force. So they are in line with other projections and clearly the administration is concerned that things may be going in the wrong direction.  GUPTA: Yes, I mean --  COOPER: At least some are. GUPTA: -- it's interesting, because I followed these models carefully  since January, and there were these various scenarios, sort of the mild pandemic scenario, the moderate, the more severe.  And what these were, it seems like maybe these scenarios were created more than a month ago, and in some ways the actual numbers that we're seeing in terms of numbers of cases and numbers of deaths, in some ways have been worse than that scenario up until this point.  But the point is, I think, Anderson, is at this plateau right now, are we going to sort of start to head back up or are we going to go down? And there's -- the plateau is definitely lasting longer than I think the modelers would have suggested.  But I think what's concerning at this point is that we're at this inflection point. And if we start heading back up and we get into exponential growth, meaning it's not just going up linearly, but all of a sudden starts to really shoot up, as we saw in mid-March, that would be a real concern.  We could double the number of deaths every single day. We could go from 25,000 people becoming infected every day to in the hundreds of thousands of people being infected every day.  There's just over a million people that have been confirmed right now with the infection. If you start talking about 100 or 200,000 people every day that have the infection, that's a million people a week, even more than that.  [20:10:00] So that's what we have to prevent. And I think that's -- when you ask me, ""Is it too early,"" that's why I'm answering that I think it is, because you want to avoid that exponential growth again.  COOPER: Sanjay, I want to bring in -- stay with us. I want to bring in Dr. Chris Murray. He's obviously the director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, we've often had him on. It's their modeling that we mentioned earlier, that's been cited by the White House, which now projects deaths above 134,000. Dr. Murray, thank you for being with us.  Can you walk us through the new numbers? Because, I mean, I think the last time we talked, I can't remember exactly, but I think your projections were in the 60,000 range. They had been as high as 81,000, I think, at one point.  What are the specific factors that have made the numbers jump so high just since last week?  CHRIS MURRAY, DIRECTOR, INSTITUTE FOR HEALTH METRICS AND EVALUATION, UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON: Well, we had been operating in the modeling assuming that states were going to stay the course, keep social distancing on through to the end of May, bring new infections down to a really low level, and then states would switch over to a testing, contact tracing, isolation strategy.  That's clearly not happening, so we've now built into the modeling what we're seeing around the country, both in terms of the mandates coming off, but also, even before the mandates came off, where we see in the mobility data, people starting to get out more, having more interaction. All that translates into greater risk of transmission.  And what we see is some states will continue going up. Texas, Georgia, Florida, a series of states in the Midwest. Other states will have much slower declines than would have occurred if there wasn't this increase in mobility.  So all that put together gives us a much bigger number by August. It also has a bigger range, and it has states with transmissions running well into July and August.  You know, the way to think about this is there's two things happening: people getting out, being more active, some people going back to work; and, on the other side, states are scaling up testing. That's why we're seeing more cases in some places, and that's a good sign.  And the temperature is going up, and we do see a statistical correlation between transmission and temperature, and what's going to happen is going to be the balance of those forces.  COOPER: Sanjay, do you have a question, I think?  GUPTA: Yes, you know, I'm curious what you -- what thought, Professor Murray, of these -- I guess it was probably a scenario that was released from today, from -- that may have come from Johns Hopkins originally, that suggested that we could go to some 200,000 new infections a day, and some 3,000 deaths a day.  And it's tough to even say that out loud, but that would be about a 1.5% mortality. What do you think of that? Does that make sense to you at all, based on your modeling?  MURRAY: Well, you know, there is a huge range of possibilities out there. Our estimates for June 1st are about 890 deaths a day, so about a third of what that model is saying. And, perhaps more importantly, I think, you know, when you see the graph from that model, it's having the U.S. go into exponential growth, you know, after June 1st.  And I think it's down to this question about how much will testing, contact tracing scale up, rising temperature, put brakes on transmission? How much will people be cautious? Will they wear a mask, will they avoid physical interaction on average?  And if that goes in the direction that we think the balance will be, we'll end up well below the 3,000 deaths a day. But it really depends what states do, what people do.  COOPER: And you found that there is a statistical correlation between mobility and transmission. I mean, does that -- can you explain that? Is that based on data you've collected in the past week or so since the states have begun to ease restrictions? MURRAY: So, what we've done is we've gone back and we looked at this  ""R"" term, you know, how many people does each case infect? And we've looked at it by state all the way back to mid-March; and then we've run statistical correlations or regressions, you know, to explore that relationship with population density, with mobility, with temperature, and with testing per capita; and we find really strong relationships.  And the strongest is mobility. So there's clearly a huge relationship between how much people are out and about and how much transmission occurs. And it also means that when we cut mobility with social distancing, that was having a very beneficial effect on transmission.  So no surprise, as people go back to being more active and interacting with each other, we're going to see increased transmission.  [20:15:00] GUPTA: Professor Murray, when I looked at some of your models earlier on, you did show this scenario where we could get to a really low level of infection. I can't remember if it was .1 percent or whatever the number was.  You see places around the world like New Zealand where you get really low rates of infection. Are you still optimistic that we can get there? I mean, there's been a lot of tough news lately. Is there some hope for optimism in terms of these low levels of infection possibilities?  MURRAY: Well, I think New Zealand is a fantastic example because they put in place with clear criteria the, sort of, stay-at-home orders, the whole social distancing package. They waited until transmission got to a really low level and now they're scaling back, and they have clear criteria by which they'll go back to social distancing if it rebounds.  We thought that that's what would happen in the U.S., that -- go the distance, stay to the end of May, get transmission to, sort of, New Zealand levels and then it's, sort of, manageable with contact tracing, isolation, testing.  Clearly that's not going to happen. I think we've entered a new phase. People in the U.S. are going to become more active. States are going to take off mandates. So now it's going to be really up to individuals to try to minimize their exposure themselves, especially those that can.  Some people don't have the luxury of having jobs where they can work from home. But, you know, wear a mask, avoid as much contact as possible, and we've really got to focus on scaling up testing and contact tracing and isolation.  And I think the most important thing is, if we can just space out, you know, the relaxation of social distancing even a little bit more, it's going to make that task more possible, right.  COOPER: Wow. This is -- yes, it's depressing. More deaths -- we're talking about more deaths, more transmissions. Obviously, there is a trade-off for getting the economy going, as well, but that's what it boils down to. Dr. Sanjay Gupta, thank you, Chris Murray, as well. Appreciate all your work. Still ahead, how should the federal government respond to these projected spikes in fatalities and caseloads? Two former Secretaries of Health and Human Services join me to discuss. Also, the spike is yet to alter any state plans to reopen. Ohio governor, Mike DeWine, is going to join me to talk about whether these new projections in any way affect his timeline for Ohio.  [20:17:30] (COMMERCIAL BREAK) COOPER: We're focused tonight on the sharp increase in the number of projected deaths from coronavirus, two reports basically projecting a large spike in fatalities.  And before the break, I spoke to the head of the institute that authored one of the reports about the reason for the spike. Dr. Chris Murray at the University of Washington said there is, quote, ""clearly a relationship between how much people are out and about and how much transmission occurs."" Joining me now are two former Secretaries of the Health & Human Services Department. Donna Shalala, who served in the Clinton administration, is currently a congresswoman from Florida, and Kathleen Sebelius, who served in the Obama administration, is the former governor of Kansas.  Secretary Sebelius, how concerned are you, first of all, about these new higher death toll projections and compared to what we are already seeing, which is people coming out, not wearing masks, and states opening up?  KATHLEEN SEBELIUS, FORMER SECRETARY OF HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES: Well, Anderson, I'm very concerned, and I think that we all should be concerned. We are a big country. We have a disease that's moving from spot to spot.  I listened to Scott Gottlieb, the former head of the Food and Drug Administration, over the weekend, who talked about the fact that we are in for a slow simmering summer where disease outbreaks are likely to occur.  And what he said is that although the last six weeks of mitigation -- strong mitigation in some states, of staying at home and social distancing and really locking down, definitely had an impact, but it didn't have as much as an impact as people would have hoped.  The curve has really not gone very much down. We're on a plateau, which means as we open up, as we continue to have hot spots and meatpacking plants in places like Kansas, in nursing homes, in prisons all over this country, we are going to see outbreaks continue to occur. And I don't know any state, as a former governor, any state who has  actually met the guidelines that the CDC put out, of 14 days of decline in disease, or is ready for the kind of massive contact tracing that we need to be able to do with testing to isolate cases as they begin to reoccur.  COOPER: Congresswoman Shalala, given what Secretary Sebelius was just saying, none of these states really have met the 14-day criteria. I find it sort of stunning that -- obviously President Trump was embarrassed by suggesting that perhaps studies should be done of injecting disinfectants into people, and so coronavirus task force briefings have stopped.  It seems like the administration now essentially just wants this to be a state-wide effort, state by state, and not have the Trump administration be the face of this on a daily basis.  REP. DONNA SHALALA (D-FL): You know, it's a stunning lack of leadership and it's a human tragedy that's unfolding. Each of these lives are precious. The administration should have hit this with a hammer.  They never purchased the testing supplies that would have been necessary. They never purchased the PPE. This should not have ever -- the supply issue should have never been left to the states.  And the standards and the states' strategies should have been brought to the federal government, approved by them, and then implemented by the states and funded by the states. A group of us have introduced a bill that does exactly that.  But hitting it with a hammer was very important initially. And instead they went tap, tap, tap, and basically said, okay, states, you decide. You purchase everything. And they left it to the states.  [20:25:00] You know, it's like the Articles of Confederation when they were sort of competing against each other. We are one country, and it demanded fabulous leadership, and we just didn't get it.  And hitting it with a hammer, it's our behavior -- hitting it with a hammer and then asking people to stay at home as part of that strategy, it would have at least driven this downward.  And now we're out there opening up restaurants with no testing. We have grocery stores opened and everybody that works there is not being tested. We're not even testing all the people that are cleaning buildings, including our hospitals.  And we're falling further behind, in my judgment, even though it looks like we're leveling-off. And I'm -- I'm scared to death about these frenetic openings, and it's not like I stay -- like staying inside. I hate staying inside.  COOPER: Secretary Sebelius, I mean, what's your advice to people who are watching tonight? Because, I mean, this -- it is frightening. Obviously, look, everybody wants to get back to work, get back in business and get going, and -- you know, be outside.  But this is not a situation where an individual just being responsible protects that individual. SEBELIUS: That's right. COOPER: It's -- your safety is dependent on other people, you know, behaving, at least wearing a mask.  SEBELIUS: Well, I think that in many states, and I'm fortunate to live in one where our governor has been excellent at every step along the way. We have a wonderful Secretary of Health and Environment who gives very clear daily briefings, who believes in science. We follow the science, and we're going to do that.  The problem is, you know, across the border we have a governor who is not paying so much attention, and we have a big bi-state Kansas City area where half the people are in Missouri and half the state are in Kansas: very different rules.  We desperately need federal guidance. I'm terrified by the fact, now, that I hear that the administration not only blocked Dr. Fauci from testifying in the House, as requested on Friday, but now they're going to block task force members, and I'm really interested in the scientists. I'm not so interested in the politicians.  I want the scientists to talk clearly to the American public about what is going on. I want CDC to put out federal guidance on how contact tracing should be done, what are the criteria, how fast it should be done; and I'm hoping that Donna Shalala and her colleagues in the House, as they have provided such terrific leadership, demand transparency on what is going on, and demand that the federal government step up with one voice.  Because until we have some kind of confidence that we are getting a message, no one is going to leave their own neighborhood, or their own block. COOPER: Yes. SEBELIUS: You can rely on what you can see around you. Until you have some confidence there is some pattern of similarity, nobody is going anywhere.  COOPER: Well, congresswoman Shalala, I mean, what happened -- like, you know, the president talked about ""Liberate Michigan."" Liberate the scientists. Why aren't we hearing -- if the president doesn't want the coronavirus task force any more, I get that, I get why he wouldn't want to, after the last performance.  But why aren't we hearing from the CDC every day, and the National Institutes of Health? And, you know, the CDC used to be a really respected organization. It seems like they've been muzzled or kneecapped. SHALALA: In fact, they've muzzled lots of people in the government,  including firing the I.G. at H.H.S, who put out a report that was so evenhanded they literally must not have read it. And the idea of firing someone who has oversight is really outrageous.  But the idea of telling Tony Fauci, one of the world's greatest scientists that he can testify at the Senate, but not at the House because they don't want him to spend the time, after they have tied him up in briefings and in meetings for literally two months, is really unacceptable.  COOPER: Yes.  SHALALA: And it's unacceptable to muzzle any scientist, because we need clear information, as my colleague has just said.  COOPER: Yes. Congressman Shalala, I appreciate your time. Secretary Sebelius, as well.  A quick programming note: you can join Jake Tapper as he investigates what has happened during the U.S. fight against COVID-19. The CNN special report, ""The Pandemic and the President,"" that airs tonight at 11:00 p.m. Eastern. It's definitely worth watching. Up next on 360, I'll talk to the Ohio governor Mike DeWine about his state slowly reopening against the stark backdrop of a big jump in the projected death rates nationwide. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [20:34:30] COOPER: Breaking news tonight, a key modeling projection has vaulted the number of estimated deaths caused by the pandemic to more than 134,000 by early August. That's nearly double the last projection, due in part to relaxing social distancing. This, as dozens of states start to reopen.  Joining me is Ohio Governor, Mike DeWine, a state that is slowly starting to reopen.  Governor, thanks so much for being with us. I know how busy you are. How concerned are you that your state -- about the pace of opening?  Obviously it's always a balance. You're in a difficult position.  [20:35:00] How do you balance these new projections, the modeling showing potential increases, with the need to have people work and get back to their lives?  GOV. MIKE DEWINE (R-OH): Well, that is the balance, and we think we can do two things at once. But, obviously, the news out today is very concerning: it should be concerning to every American. We're trying to balance it this way: you know, we've seen for about  three weeks a slight downward trend in hospitalization, which we think is good. We'd like for it to be, obviously, much -- much more downward.  You know, we now have something we didn't have a couple weeks ago, and that is a real capacity in regard to testing. We dramatically increased this with a contract, and also with Ohio manufacturers making a lot of the swabs.  So we're going to have, really, a very vigorous tracing program, about 1,800 people around the state of Ohio. So that's one way that we think that we can stay on top of this.  But you're right; I watched part of your program tonight.  Look, people -- it's warmer weather, people want to get out. There certainly is more movement in Ohio than we have seen before, and I think all of that is natural, but what we're trying to get people to do is wear the mask when they go out, and, you know, keep that social distancing. It's very, very important.  COOPER: So, you said you have 1,800 people for contact tracing. Do you know what the number was prior to this? Just in, you know -- DEWINE: Yes, we don't have them yet, though. You know -- COOPER: Okay. DEWINE: Anderson, we don't have them yet. (CROSSTALK) COOPER: That's the point, 1,800. What is that compared to normal times?  DEWINE: Yes, we probably have about 660, something like that, right now, which is norm. We're starting to ramp that up; we got a crash program to do that. But it's not going to come overnight, we know that, but it's just very, you know, very important that we do that.  The other thing we've done is we have slowly started to roll out, and gone into different industries.  For example, we've got -- we're talking -- looking at restaurants and bars. We have not done them yet, but we've got -- we put together business working groups, who worked alongside health people to come up with the best practices in every one of the industries.  So, it's not only about when we're going to do it, but it's about how we're going to do it. COOPER: Yes. DEWINE: And we think that, with that business help, we've got the ""How"" down as well as we can get it down. COOPER: You had amended it that people wear masks in stores, and  correct me if I'm wrong, and then there was, obviously, a backlash to that, and so you went back on that.  I'm wondering what's wrong with the idea of people wearing masks in stores, in an enclosed space? It's not even for them, it's for everybody else in the store. Can a -- if that's not law, can a business still insist that people either wear a mask, or -- and if not, they don't come in?  DEWINE: Sure. Yes. No, no, absolutely, a business can do that. You know, we're trying to, you know, change the culture of wearing mask to show that it's exactly what you said it was, and that is you're wearing it for someone else. It is the right thing to do. What our -- what we came back with, though, was a mandate that every employee would have to wear a mask.  As you pointed out, we wanted to mandate that for people who would go into a restaurant, or people who would go into retail. The pushback we got was pretty hard. It became clear to me that this was just something that was a bridge too far, people were just not going to accept a mandate from the government.  What we are now doing is I'm talking a lot about it, and we really, you know, hope that people, when they think about this, will understand that this is a very important thing to do.  COOPER: I want to play something that former New Jersey governor Chris Christie said to our Dana Bash today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRIS CHRISTIE, FORMER GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY: Of course everybody wants to save every life they can. But the question is towards what end, ultimately? Are there ways that we can thread the middle here to allow that there are going to be deaths, and there are going to be deaths no matter what.  And if we can do things to keep people in the mode of wearing masks, of wearing gloves, of, you know, distancing where appropriate. We've got to let some of these folks get back to work, because if we don't we're going to destroy the American way of life, and these families, and it will years and years before we can recover.  (END VIDEO CLIP) DEWINE: Well, I think -- COOPER: And that is what it boils down to. Do you agree with what he's saying?  DEWINE: Well, I think that it's absolutely true that there are a lot of costs for high unemployment, and a huge crash in the economy, that we have seen. And they're not all -- there are a lot of social costs, there are, obviously, the economic costs, but there are also medical costs, in the sense of health costs. [20:40:00] You know, we -- generally, when the economy goes down, you see domestic abuse, for example, go up. You see depression go up. So there are, in fact, a lot of costs.  And so, we're trying to do two things in Ohio at once, and, you know, we're trying to do it very, very carefully. But I think that, you know, you are trying to do both of those things. But the bottom line really is, Ohioans have been great about distancing. They've got us this far. They flattened the curve. They got us to the point where we are today.  They're going to have to continue to do that if we're going to avoid a big spike in the number of cases and see a dramatic increase in the number of deaths. I have confidence that they can do that. But really, it's not the orders I issue or my health director issues. It's really what people do every day in their own lives that ultimately has this huge effect across the state.  COOPER: Yes, well, I'm sure you and the folks working with you are agonizing over these decisions. There is no easy answer. Governor DeWine, I appreciate your time. Thank you.  DEWINE: Congratulations on the baby. Great thing.  COOPER: Thanks very much. Thanks. Appreciate it.  DEWINE: Thank you. COOPER: And more breaking news ahead. There is new reporting on what key American allies are saying about the origin of the virus. We'll be right back.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [20:45:00] COOPER: There is breaking news tonight in the intelligence tied to the origins of the coronavirus. Our senior national security correspondent, Alexander Marquardt, joins us with details. What have you learned, Alex?  ALEXANDER MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Anderson, this is -- what we're hearing now is that the Trump administration pushing this line that this virus came out of a lab in Wuhan is really at odds with some of its closest intelligence partners.  There have been these two main theories, that it came out of a lab or it came out of a market. And I spoke with a western diplomatic official who says that the intelligence assessment -- this official has seen the intelligence -- says that it is highly unlikely that this was a lab accident at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.  Rather, that it was highly likely that this was a natural occurrence, that the virus was passed from an animal to a human. This is, according to this official, the growing assessment of the so-called Five Eyes intelligence sharing group. That is a crucial intelligence sharing coalition that the U.S. is part of, along with Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand.  And I spoke with another Five Eyes official who concurred that this is their assessment, this is what makes the most sense. This is only, Anderson, I should caution, an assessment. This means that it's not 100 percent that there is no smoking gun, according to the greater intelligence community.  This, Anderson, is not just a theory that is being pushed by the Trump administration. Sources have told us that senior officials like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, has asked the intelligence agencies, including the CIA, to find evidence that lines up with this theory, that the virus came out of a lab.  So far, the U.S. intelligence community has not given their own assessment. In fact, in a remarkable statement last week, they came out saying that they are still looking into both of those theories, that it either came from the lab or it came from the market. Anderson. COOPER: Alexander Marquardt, appreciate it. Thanks. President Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have been blaming China for causing the virus, as Alex was just saying. With me now, CNN chief White House correspondent, Jim Acosta. So what have the president and Pompeo being saying about China?  JIM ACOSTA, CNN CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, as Alex was just saying a few moments ago, they have been pushing this theory that it came out of a lab somehow. They've been pushing the line that it was more of a mistake in that lab in Wuhan, China, and not that it was a bioweapon.  We heard the Secretary of State on one of the Sunday talk shows over the weekend, saying that there was enormous evidence that this came out of a lab, and we heard the president at that town hall on Fox say that he believes that this was some kind of terrible mistake on the part of the Chinese, and that they are embarrassed by it and are covering it up.  Anderson, what we are lacking at this point is any evidence to back up any of these claims. And in addition to the skepticism that was expressed by the other intelligence communities, four U.S. partners that Alex was just talking about a few moments ago, there are reservations about this theory inside the public health community.  I can tell you a source close to the coronavirus task force has told me that it is still the belief among some members on that task force that this started with an animal to human infection, and not out of that lab. And in the words of the source, every time one of these outbreaks occurs, there is a theory that it started in a lab in China.  And sometimes it just doesn't pan out. That theory just doesn't pan out, and so you are seeing the administration trying mightily to lean in that direction, but they haven't presented the evidence to back it up yet.  COOPER: All right. Jim, appreciate it. I want to bring in CNN's David Culver who has reported extensively on the virus. He's in Shanghai tonight for us. And in Washington, we have CNN chief political analyst, Gloria Borger.  David, the DHS findings amplified by Secretary Pompeo that China was stockpiling supplies, hiding the seriousness of the virus, does that align with your reporting? DAVID CULVER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Mishandling, cover-up, some of the underreporting, silencing of whistle-blowers, Anderson, these are some of the many things that we highlighted early on in this.  To suggest, though, that this cover-up was also coexisting with a stockpiling of some of these badly needed PPE, doesn't really align. I've got to say, some of the folks that we would talk with on the front lines early on in this January into February -- there was a dire need here, so it wasn't that they were able to really stockpile, even.  They couldn't even meet the demand at the time. We know that because medical personnel were getting infected, some, in one hospital, by the dozens, and many losing their lives.  It also became highly politicized. You will recall when one of the first evacuation flights took off on January 29th, there was a week delay to then evacuate more American diplomats from Wuhan. And what we have learned shortly thereafter, was there was a back and forth between the Chinese and the U.S. governments over PPE.  Essentially, the aircraft that was coming into Wuhan was coming in empty. That angered the Chinese. They said, no, we've got to prioritize that airport for the aircraft that are coming in from South Korea and Japan bringing in medical supplies.  So it was something that was very sensitive early on. It was badly needed here. That said, we are now at a point where certainly, the Chinese have ramped up production, and there is a surplus. [20:50:00] COOPER: Gloria, China is certainly, you know, there is a lot to point the finger at, there is a lot to, you know, be concerned about: their lack of transparency, a whole host of things.  It certainly, though, also plays into, you know, President Trump's favor, in terms of the election, in terms of making China the enemy, downplaying, you know, the -- his own wasting valuable time, the lost month of February that this administration had, where the president was, you know, pushing, you know, the idea that this was all going to disappear by April.  GLORIA BORGER, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, they're looking for an easy scapegoat, and they've clearly found one, I think, in China. China is not very popular in this country. Internal Republican polls show that China can be an easy scapegoat for them. But I think the problem they have here, Anderson, is that this raises  more questions.  For example, if the president was so convinced that China's to blame, why did he consistently praise President Xi, more than a dozen times in January, February, even into March? Why did he continue to communicate with him, and say, you know, they've got it under control? Was the president asleep at the switch here?  Was the president more interested, for example, in getting a trade deal with China at this point than getting at the truth? Was the president not briefed? Was he not paying attention to his intelligence briefs? I mean, these are all questions that have to be answered.  And, Anderson, you know, one day after the president said he was briefed on January 23rd, but it wasn't a really scary briefing about coronavirus, he said that he had spoken with Xi, and he said they had been working very hard to contain the coronavirus, and we appreciate their efforts and their transparency. And he then went on to thank the president.  COOPER: Yes, and Jim, obviously transparency is something they weren't being; the president said they were. Now the president, I assume, has talked to other people, and realized the benefit of going after China, and, you know, using that to, you know, dissuade people or kind of shield his own failures in this.  ACOSTA: Absolutely, Anderson. I tried to press the president on this late last week, and he suggested that one of the reasons why he was praising China and praising President Xi earlier this year was because he was, as Gloria was just saying, in the middle of these trade negotiations with China, trying to get a trade deal with China.  But, you know, you talk to Trump's surrogates, you look at Republican memos that are handed out to candidates up on Capitol Hill, lawmakers who are trying to keep their seat up on Capitol Hill. A lot of these internal strategy memos say, ""Blame China. Defend or don't defend the president, but definitely blame China,"" and so it's a recurring theme inside the Republican party at this point.  What the president has not adequately answered are two things. One is, why was he praising China, praising President Xi, calling them transparent for months and months and months; and where is the evidence now that this is all China's fault?  Obviously, there is a lot to criticize when it comes to China. They're not the most transparent, obviously, they're a communist totalitarian regime, and so on. But that does not the president out of the fix where's he's at right now, which is in many ways the president was asleep at the switch, he was downplaying this for weeks, and now there is a very catastrophic death toll in the making -- Anderson  COOPER: Jim Acosta, David Culver, Gloria Borger, thanks very much. Up next, we remember more of those who have died in this pandemic, including a five-month-old. We'll be right back.  [20:53:55] (COMMERCIAL BREAK) COOPER: Tonight, we remember more of those who died during this pandemic. Troy Sneed was a Grammy nominated singer, producer of gospel music. He grew up in Florida, and as a teenager, he dreamed of playing in the NFL. He had to give up football, though, in high school, because he sustained injuries.  That's when he turned to music. He joined the choir at Florida A&M University. From there, he went on to sing and produce gospel radio hits. In 1996, he appeared with the Georgia Mass Choir in the film, ""The Preacher's Wife"", with Denzel Washington and Whitney Houston.  He and his wife, Emily, ran their own record label called ""Emtro"", which is a combination of their names. They were married for 27 years. They had four children. Troy Sneed was 52 years old.  Jay-Natalie La Santa is one of the youngest known victims of this virus. She was born just last November. Her dad, as you see, is a New York City firefighter. Her mom works for the Board of Education.  Jay-Natalie had a heart condition, so when she came down with a fever in March, her parents took her to the hospital. Her father called her a warrior princess with a fighting spirit, and she did fight this virus for a month in the hospital.  At one point the fluid in her little lungs started to clear and her parents were optimistic for her recovery. But she went into cardiac arrest and doctors couldn't resuscitate her. She was the only child and only grandchild in the family. Her grand mom said she was the most precious thing they had. Jay-Natalie La Santa was just five months old.  Our thoughts go out to them and all the families impacted by this virus. The news continues. I want to hand it over to Chris for ""Cuomo Prime Time"". Chris. CHRIS CUOMO, CNN HOST: So much bad news, Anderson. I can't let go of the good news. How was the weekend with Wyatt? Come on, let's see the smile. There it is.  [21:00:00] "
1,CNN,"ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST: Erin, thanks very much, good evening everybody. Typically, we try to start the program with the latest medical and health information about the Coronavirus, its spread, the promise of therapies, the information you need to know in the middle of the pandemic and we still will do that tonight. We'll have all that information but tonight, we want to start with the information that you aren't getting now and won't soon get about the pandemic. Multiple reports today once again show this administration's attempt to resist lawful oversight and its contempt for whistle-blowers and independent inspector-generals. First, regarding the Coronavirus taskforce, it appears the President wants to end it. They're talking about ending the taskforce in the middle of the pandemic and cases are still rising.  They rose by at least 1,938 today in fact but they want to dissolve the taskforce. The President confirmed it while on a trip to a mask making factory in Arizona today. The Vice-President says this should happen around Memorial Day which is 20 days from now. Asked why he would end the taskforce now, this is how the President responded. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: With the doctors saying that there might be a recurrence of the Coronavirus in the Fall, why -- can you just explain why is now the time to wind down that taskforce? DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Well, because we can't keep our country closed for the next few years. You know, you can say there might be a recurrence and there -- there might be and the -- you know, most doctors or some doctors say that it will happen and it will be a flame and we're going to put the flame out. We've learnt a lot. (END VIDEO CLIP) COOPER: So -- just keeping him honest here, -no one has said close the country for five years. That's just a -- a complete exaggeration and the President is admitting the crisis not going away but he is certainly trying to downplay the potential risk, saying that it'll be a flame and that they've learnt a lot and they can just quickly put it out.  Why end the taskforce though? The hub of the Federal response? Yes, the President embarrassed himself and the country when he took -- when he last took questions with the taskforce, suggesting injecting disinfectant into people, yes, he lied about saying that. But that's no reason to stop having the taskforce and its scientists brief the public. It seems like they don't want their fingerprints on this. It seems like the Federal Government, the administration, is trying to pass the buck, pass the responsibility onto the States, onto mayors, onto governors, to anyone other than themselves so that they won't take the blame come election time.  So that's one story tonight, where the White House is closing down the one place you can sort of rely on from the government for reliable information at least from the scientists, from Dr Fauci and Dr Birx. We mentioned there were multiple political angles that we're covering tonight. The other comes in the form of a whistle-blower lawsuit which alleges a former top health official at Health and Human Services was fired. The lawsuit alleges that Richard Bryce early earning -- warnings about the virus were mostly ignored. Also, that he was removed because he fought against the use of an anti-malarial drug, one that a VA study has since shown increases the likelihood of death and has no benefits.  Incidentally, at Fox's Town Hall on Sunday, President Trump still insists the drug has saved lives, again, in the middle of a pandemic. Bryce's lawsuit also says he was pressured to give federal money to a pharmaceutical buddy of the President's son-in-law, Jared Kushner. There's no allegation that Kushner knew about this alleged pressure. But ""The Washington Post"" is reporting is that his shadow taskforce, the one that will continue to operate, even as the official White House one closes shop, the one with the scientists on it, has dropped the ball on procuring medical supplies, largely because he's promoted his friends and associates, many of whom have no experience.  And these breaking stories are all taking place as new modeling projects deaths will almost double because we are beginning to reopen the country. Also, as he's preventing officials like Dr Anthony Fauci from testifying before Democratic-led committees in the House. Again, the recurring theme is that any information that's unfavorable to the President's re-election campaign is on lockdown tonight -- which is not surprising coming from a President who once said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KRISTEN WELKER, NBC REPORTER: Dr Fauci said earlier this week that the lag in testing was in fact a failing. Do you take responsibility for that and when do can you guarantee that every single American who needs a test will be able to have a test? What's the test of that? TRUMP: Yeah, no, I don't take responsibility at all -- (END VIDEO CLIP) COOPER: Joining me now with more on all this is CNN's White House Correspondent, Kaitlin Collins. So Kaitlin, what more are you learning about this -- this decision to -- to essentially do away with the -- the Coronavirus taskforce? KAITLIN COLLINS, CNN'S WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, this is something they've been weighing for several weeks now and if you look at the schedule, actually, of all of the meetings that they've been having, they've started cutting them back because it used to be daily that they would have these meetings, Anderson.  They would sometimes last an hour and a half, if not longer than that and now they've started having fewer of them. You're starting to see the Vice-President get on the road more. Of course, he's the one often leading those. The President himself is also trying to get on the road more, even though he's not often at these meetings.   And so, the question is going to be if the President is going to form some other kind of task force to take it's place. We know with the economics task force that the President constructed to help re-open the country, it was really large, it hasn't really met in any kind of capacity like you've seen this task force meet.  And so, the Vice President is now confirming that it could wind down by the end of this month by early June -- even though that seemed to be a surprise to even some members of their own coronavirus task force who didn't seem aware that it would be winding down just that quickly. COOPER: And is it clear to you what exactly this means? I mean, assuming Dr. Fauci is he still going to be then controlled by the Vice President's office or the White House or the President's not wanting -- the White House isn't wanting him to testify in Capitol Hill in front of house committees, I guess because there's Democrats on them or they're controlled by Democrats. Does that mean then the CDC can hold press conferences everyday talking about the latest scientific information or the NHI can do that? COLLINS: Well, that'll be the question if they do that and really what this looks like. Because the CDC has not held a briefing since March, of course, we know the CDC officials sometimes anger the President with their pretty blunt warnings to the public.  But also, the question is one of the reasons before the President admitted today that it was about politics of why Dr. Fauci couldn't go testify in front of the Democratic led house, but he could go in front of the republican led Senate, is they said Dr. Fauci was too busy to be going up to Capitol Hill and testifying.  And so, they said that there's this policy where none of the officials on the task force can go testify on Capitol Hill for the month of May, unless Mark Meadows -- the chief of staff, grants his approval. So, the question is does that change after May and they're no longer having these briefings or does the White House continue to make that argument about their schedules? But also, I wonder what this will look like, because Dr. Burks is someone -- she has an office inside the west wing, so, is her office space going to remain?  Those kinds of questions, because often you've seen if you rely on the White House spokespeople or the President himself for information it's often very different than what you get from the actual professionals who are looking at this data on a daily basis. COOPER: Yes, and it's interesting that they're concerned about Dr. Burks time and Dr. Fauci's time when they had no problem having Dr. Burks or Dr. Fauci sit there sometimes for more than an hour as the President mused about whatever came into his mind and tried to grab the spotlight of the very coronavirus task force. They had no problem with the doctors, the scientists sitting, waiting for the President to finish so that they could actually present factual information to the American people.  The whistle blower complaint from Rick Bright, how -- the President said he didn't know the guy, how damning is it for the White House? And again, these are allegations, they haven't been proven. COLLINS: No, they're only allegations, we should note that. HHS has been pretty buttoned up about this, because they know obviously it's leading to an investigation that he has filed a request for tonight. And we should note, we are going to hear from him in person next Thursday according to his attorney's because they say he's going to be testifying on Capitol Hill, so, he may go into these allegations more.  But also, looking at this, initially we know that in his statement he said he believed he was removed from his job because of retaliation because he wouldn't grant express approval to drugs that the President had pushed. But if you read through this really lengthy complaint that he filed, Anderson, he also talks about the fact that he says he raised concerns back in January with top officials like the HHS secretary, Alex Azar about coronavirus, saying that he thought he was concerned it could already be in the United States.  He said that was something that was greeted with skepticism and also those officials he said -- the top officials, Azar and another Bob Kadlec, were confidently saying they believe they could keep coronavirus out of the US. Of course, that has not happened, so a lot of questions are also going to be about what his interactions were with other officials and whether or not that slowed down the administrations response even more overall to the coronavirus. COOPER: Caitlin Collins, appreciate it. Thanks Caitlin. Joining us now is Juliet Kayyem, CNN National Security Analyst and former US assistant secretary for homeland security, also Chief Political Correspondent Dana Bash and Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta.  So, Sanjay, the talk of disbanding the task force obviously on the face of it, it seems surprising giving that this is an ongoing pandemic that will continue through the summer and very likely for -- until there's a vaccine or until enough people have become infected that there's a change in the spread of this. What do you make of the idea of closing this down? SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, I mean, I think it's a -- it's a bad idea. You know, I hope that the work is still going on, you know, even if there's not a -- you know, these briefings and an actual task force.  You remember there was -- back in 2014, there was an Ebola czar, and there was this idea you need to create this whole of government approach for something like this and I think that's still necessary.  But I think, you know, subjectively, Anderson, I -- there's a sense that the Coronavirus task force is being disbanded, states are reopening. You know, I think a lot of people -- it sends the message that this is over, you know, we -- we've gotten through this and it's very much the wrong message.  You know, Anderson, I was just looking up on March 16 when they first announced the pause, there were some 4500 people who had been confirmed to have the infection and some 70 people who had died.  And now, you know, you can see this. At the time they were thinking about disbanding this task force, the deaths have gone up a thousandfold, which is -- which is just startling, and obviously the rate of infection. So how do you create it when you had those numbers and disband it when the numbers are what they are and continue to go up?  COOPER: Yes. Dana, I mean, I guess, you know, you could perhaps make an argument that, okay, you disband it and that allows the doctors, the -- you know, Fauci and Birx to focus more on their work, and then the -- you know, there will still be a place where every day there's briefings and scientists get out important information and there is still a federal response.  DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. COOPER: Or this is just an attempt by the administration to distance themselves from this, say, ""Look, we gave the best practice. We did all we could. We gave the best practices to the states. We gave them all the equipment they needed,"" and basically get some distance between the President and the deaths of so many Americans.  BASH: Yes, I think you just nailed it, Anderson, and, you know, for the second time today when the President was taking questions from reporters in Arizona, he said the quiet part out loud. And the quiet part, it was -- you could see the wheels turning and if you read the transcript, it's pretty clear he wants this part of his history behind him. He wants to move on. He is, again, trying to talk all of the current situation and the crises that the governors and the local officials are still facing away, saying, ""We did a really good job. We got the ventilators out. Everybody's got testing,"" which obviously we know is not accurate, but he's trying to make it so with his words. The challenge that he has and the real, real political risk -- never mind the health and wellness of Americans -- is if that doesn't happen, then it's closer to the election. Then he has distanced himself. Then people get even sicker as Sanjay, I know, takes no pleasure in predicting as a real possibility. And then it really backfires.  And that's the kind of the balance and he and more importantly his aides are trying to find here. But it's very clear that this push is coming from the President, and that's what I mean by him saying the quiet part out loud. It started to bubble up through reporting today and it was the President himself who was obviously driving that train.  COOPER: You know, Juliette, I mean, I hate to be -- sound cynical on this, but, you know, he loved the task force when he saw it as something he could ride and ride the wave of, you know. Once Birx and Fauci started to become -- JULIETTE KAYYEM, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Yes. COOPER: -- respected and popular by the daily briefings, the President jumped in on them, took them over, used them to, you know, I guess in his mind, to great effect. He talked about his ratings and how high they were and how great things were going. And then he embarrasses himself by talking about injecting human beings with disinfectant, is widely ridiculed, then lies about it, and then suddenly the task force is no longer -- KAYYEM: Yes. COOPER: -- as important. I mean, if it can be disbanded in the middle of the pandemic, what was exactly the point of creating it in the first place and then who handles the response -- KAYYEM: I think -- COOPER: -- to the virus now from the federal government?  KAYYEM: Well, I think there will be some federal response if nothing but for the fact there is going to be a vaccine hopefully at some stage and it's going to take the federal government to respond. But I think you're exactly right. The numbers just got too big for Trump to be able to manage. We sort of swept by the -- all of the sort of rosy assessments of how many would die and I think once it passed 60,000, which was his original number, it's very hard to manage that. So what you're looking at is, I think, essentially a crisis response, a homeland security response in three failures. I mean, the first one is, of course, ignoring the intelligence as it was coming from China. That's the step that Richard Bright is talking about, that, you know, we knew it was coming. The second is the failure to deliver things to the states and to get them ready. It's sort of a failure of execution. And now I think you're just going to see sort of a failure of counting. I think that this is about ignoring the dead. I do at this stage. I think that the numbers are going to be too big. COOPER: No. KAYYEM: And instead of honoring them and learning from them, ""How did they die? Can we protect vulnerable populations?"", he's going to ignore them, which is not only morally, you know, shocking, it is also scary because as Sanjay keeps saying, we've got this thing for a long time.   Right, so, we could actually save lives if we took a better accounting of what's going on. So, this is his homeland security apparatus, fortunately we do have states that - COOPER: Yes. KAYYEM: -- may be able to try to pick up the slack. COOPER: Well, I mean, Sanjay, to Juliette's point and it was former HHS secretary Kathleen Sebelius who pointed this out to me -- when President Trump went to the CDC early on and he now said the infamous ""anyone wants it can get a test"", he also at that point said something to the effect of -- he was talking about the 15 patients that had already gotten coronavirus at that point, it was that low number and he was basically saying that he didn't want those numbers or more numbers on him.  The idea that he doesn't want even more testing -- again, this is now just more theory, because you can't say what's in his head, but all the evidence points to him claiming there's wide-spread testing when in fact a lot of people there are still issues with testing and he's never been a big proponent of getting out huge amounts of tests.  One way to look at it is he doesn't want those numbers on his record -- just as Juliette was saying, he doesn't want those deaths on his record. What do you make -- I mean, one of the purposes of the task force was to communicate to the American people what's happening ,what we should be doing by eliminating, that kind of communication. GUPTA: Right. COOPER: What message does it send? GUPTA: Well, that's one of the great tragedies I think, in all this, I think about this whole issue and I've been so immersed in it for three or four months now that there were so many opportunities for the United States with an amazing medical system, public health system that had been under-funded but is still pretty remarkable public health system to really step up and do something remarkable here.  I mean, it's clear that we got -- we were late in terms of testing, we were late in terms of recognizing, but there was still so many opportunities along the way to dramatically reduce the numbers of people who got infected and obviously the numbers of people who have died as a result of this and there's still opportunities. So, the idea that it's become some sort of ""I don't want to test, because I don't really want to know the numbers"", there's just no excuse at this point, because the number of people who could die from this still.  The IHME models, Anderson, you and I talk to Chris Murray on a regular basis, those may even be low -- they've always been low, frankly. And even with this updated estimate, I think it's still low and we're still not doing something -- we're not doing the things that we should do about it. They gave clear guidelines, 14-day downward trend, have testing in place.  What happened to that conversation? It just sort of disappeared, the states now just say we're going to re-open without following very clear, easy to understand guidelines. COOPER: Yes, what happened was the President suggested that the government look into injecting human beings with disinfectant and then got mortified and embarrassed about it -- I don't know if mortified, but certainly embarrassed and ridiculed and then lied about it --  BASH: And he sided with the protesters. COOPER: -- and then did away with the task force where he said that. It started with the -- how do you mean? BASH: Yes, and he sided with the protestors too. Meaning the people who were - COOPER: Siding with the protesters, right. BASH: -- out there in Michigan and elsewhere saying we need to re-open our lives and re-open government and saying this is oppressive. He sided with them and that was a signal to the Governor's, despite what happened early on with the Georgia Governor, he decided that he was going to side with them and that changed the whole narrative across the country. COOPER: Yes, all these weekend warriors are siding with -- are protesting the President's own guidelines and the President sides with them against the guidelines he allegedly - KAYYEM: Yes, I think - COOPER: -- was supporting. BASH: Here you go again - KAYYEM: Yes. BASH: -- using logic, Anderson. KAYYEM: I think the problem is --  COOPER: Yes. KAYYEM: -- that there's responsible opening up and irresponsible opening up and Donald Trump is sort of like we're going to do one or the other. We can have debates and we can try to manage this in a responsible fashion. We open up critical infrastructure or supply chains, we talk - COOPER: Right. KAYYEM: -- we instead of him just saying it's open, and that's the scary part. COOPER: Right, right. Instead of saying ""Well, it's five-years closed down or nothing"". KAYYEM: Yes. COOPER: Anyway, Juliette Kayyem --  KAYYEM: It's just a fast choice. COOPER: -- Dana Bash, thank you. Dr. Sanjay Gupta, stay with us. Still to come an award winning journalist who saw a pandemic like this coming decades ago wrote an authoritative account still relevant today. Laurie Garrett is her name, she joins me, she's a really fascinating person to talk to, we look forward to that.  Also, the New York Police Department taking hit, thousands in it's ranks have fallen sick -- 38 employees there have died, we'll talk to Deputy Commissioner from the NYPD who himself has recovered from coronavirus.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) COOPER: More in the breaking news, the White House considering disbanding the Coronavirus taskforce on the day that so far at least 2,100 people have died from the Coronavirus. 2,100. As President Trump pushes to reopen the economy. Quoting the President today, ""Will some people be affected badly? Yes, but we have to get our country opened.""  Joining me now is Laurie Garrett, a columnist for foreign policy and a Pulitzer, Peabody and Polk Award winning writer and journalist, whose book, ""The Coming Plague"" decades ago warned about the dangers of emerging diseases like the Coronavirus. Laurie, thank you so much for being with us. Does it make sense to you that the Coronavirus taskforce would wind down at the end of this month, in the middle of this pandemic? LAURIE GARRETT, SCIENCE JOURNALIST, AUTHOR, ""THE COMING PLAGUE"": Of course not, Anderson. It's -- it's insane. It's absolutely dumbfounding. How, when our epidemic is all still on the ascent, could you possibly imagine that you would shut down all the leadership? It makes no sense at all. COOPER: When you say it's on the ascent, the President says, ""Well, look, there's a lot of States where this -- you know, this really has been a big deal. That -- that it is not -- that it's not really an issue."" GARRETT: Look, from the very beginning -- well, let me back up a minute. My -- after I wrote ""The Coming Plague"" which was quite -- quite a number of years ago, one of the criticisms of it was that I hadn't authored solutions. What could people do to not get infected by a plague?  So my second book, ""Betrayal or Trust"", I looked at how is public heath organized? And around the world, how does it respond when outbreaks happen? And one of the things that's really noteworthy about the United States is we're really the only country in the world where public health is completely fragmented.   By the way it originated in this country, the authorities are down at the local level -- in some states there's a difference between one county and another county in terms of regulations and rules and how - COOPER: So, it's a -- GARRETT: -- public health operates. COOPER: -- hodgepodge approach you've called it. GARRETT: Absolutely hodgepodge. And now when you put a big stress on like this pandemic and it's going to affect places differently because that's the nature of how things move around in an epidemic. Well, each place is going to react differently unless at the federal level -- at the CDC and the White House, there's strong leadership that sets guidelines that all the states adhere to.  We've had exactly the opposite, and now we have the White House saying ""By the way pretty soon we're walking away entirely. We're going to leave this totally up to the local level and each one of you with your different jurisdictions and your different rules of the road, you can compete against each other for N95 masks.  You can compete against each other for solutions necessary to extract DNA and RNA from samples in order to do your testing. You can compete like heck, we're just going to sit back here and watch."" COOPER: It does seem as if the President made a -- or the people around the President made a political calculation, ""You don't want to be the face of this any longer. You rode those task force briefings well, your ratings were high, then you talked about injecting people with disinfectant and suddenly they were no longer valuable and it wasted the scientists times.  Don't let these deaths be on your record, put it on the states, say you gave them all the information, all the PPE, you sent them the comfort, you did what everybody asked you do to, you did great. And then just don't really -- don't do a lot of testing, don't talk about it and sure, maybe it'll bubble up, but it's not going to be on the administration."" I know that's a cynical way at looking at it, but it's hard to see it in other ways. GARRETT: Well, certainly that is the way, for example, Governor Andrew Cuomo or Mayor Bill de Blasio -- I happen to be in New York, so I take a New York perspective on this. But as you go around the country, you can see certain Governors are feeling fine with going along with the Trump program -- or lack of program, and others are clearly very distressed and feel very much that they've been pressured to pick up a burden and a mantle that has far exceeded the capacity of any locality.  And I would say, Anderson, the really -- the big, big explosion of this that's coming down the road that American's are going to have to face up to, it might not be immediately, you might not notice it for many months, but it is that already we are now sending New York City out competing against Houston and New Orleans. But we're also sending New York City our competing against Rome and Hong Kong and Djibouti and Cape Town, South Africa for supplies.  And so, we are the bully of the planet out there saying ""Hey, get out of the way, we want these N95 masks. You guys move aside here, we're taking all the syringes, we're going to get all the medicine."" COOPER: Right. GARRETT: ""And if there's a vaccine, we're taking it first."" And so, we're going to face huge blowback from the whole planet over our - COOPER: Right. GARRETT: -- sharp elbow behaviour and it didn't need to be this way. If we'd had federal leadership all along, then we could've been negotiating as a nation for supplies, gotten them cheaper --  COOPER: Yes, I mean you've - GARRETT: -- gotten better quality. COOPER: You've pointed out that polio was eradicated only after a huge effort and only after the Soviet Union -- in the height of the cold war and the United States both agreed -- we're arguing over nuclear weapons, but we agree polio needs to be eradicated and it was a joint effort. In terms of the length of this crisis - GARRETT: One mistake, it wasn't - COOPER: Yes. GARRETT: -- Anderson, it wasn't polio. We haven't yet eradicated polio, it was smallpox. COOPER: Smallpox, I'm sorry, I misspoke. Yes, you're right. Bill Gates has come close on polio. GARRETT: Right. COOPER: You said I've been telling everybody that my event horizon is about 36-months and that's my best case scenario. So, OK, best case, worst case, your best case scenario is 36-months. What does that 36- months look like? GARRETT: The way it would look is this, we have tremendous luck on the vaccine front, something turns out to really work and work well in the next 10 months.  It goes into large-scale clinical trials before the end of this year so that by early next year we know, yes, it's a home run, it really works. We manage to come up with a vaccine that only requires one dose, no booster, that does not require refrigeration so it's easy to transport around the world, and that it does not have to be injected so we don't have to have a whole supply chain of syringes and syringe disposal. It can be taken orally or perhaps a nasal injection or even an intramuscular patch that goes on your skin. One way or another, that miracle all transpires and then there's a next miraculous step. Nobody files for a patent or they waive patent rights so it can be globally produced, not just made by one company in one set of manufacturing sites at high profit. And then that they release everyone to go ahead and mass manufacture for the whole planet. Let's save the world instead of making a huge amount of money. And then that we come up with an army of volunteers, literally 10, 20 million people deployed across the entire planet to get to the most remote places in the Himalayas and in the rainforests and so on to vaccinate 7.5 billion people.  COOPER: That's the best case scenario?  GARRETT: That's the best case scenario. And I don't see that happening. I mean, it -- I just described so many steps that to me in this political environment look impossible. The reason, Anderson, I brought up small pox is this, that we -- the only reason we were able to get rid of small pox so that no one watching us tonight faces this once major killer on planet earth that in the 20th century killed more human beings than all the wars of the century combined, the only reason we got rid of it was not because we had a vaccine, because we had had the vaccine for decades, and not because we had a will, but because the Soviet Union and the United States at the height of the Cold War agreed to work together and got the whole WHO community behind them and off we went. Well, today would be the equivalent if China and the United States could work together, the two super powers. Well, guess what? Instead, we're saying, ""This is your fault."" ""No, no, it's your fault."" ""No, it came out of your lab."" ""No, it came out of your lab."" COOPER: Right. GARRETT: ""Well, eh to you."" And so, we -- instead of working together to help save the planet in this pandemic, we actually have exactly the opposite going on. And, you know, I don't see -- COOPER: Yes. GARRETT: -- any optimistic scenario where we end up with a global solution unless we can force Xi Jinping and Donald Trump to start behaving decently with each other.  COOPER: Laurie Garrett, I really admire your writing and -- well, yeah, I just -- I admire your writing a lot. I really appreciate talking to you. Thank you.  GARRETT: Thank you.  COOPER: Laurie Garrett. As distressing as some of the news can be, there are some new positive developments on the scientific front. I'll talk with a former acting director of the Center for Disease Control, coming up.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) COOPER: As I said at the top of the program, we want to turn to health and science, putting aside the potential ramping down of the White House Coronavirus taskforce and that whistle-blower complaint, there was some heartening news today -- New York's Governor, Andrew Cuomo, whose State is still the epicenter said that the overall total of hospitalizations in New York is down. Also down, intubations of patients. The drug maker, Pfizer, says it is starting human trials of its experimental vaccine. Still even as more than 40 States have either started to open or plan to do so in the next few days, the nationwide death toll has topped 71,000. 71,000 people.  Joining me now is Dr Richard Besser, the former Acting Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dr Besser, thanks for being with us. Just to get your reaction to the conversation I had with Laurie Garrett, as the former Acting Director of the CDC, I'm wondering what you make of the role the CDC has played so far in -- in the pandemic? DR. RICHARD BESSER, FORMER ACTING DIRECTOR, CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION: You know, Anderson, with the -- the years I spent at CDC, for four of those years I was in charge of emergency preparedness and response and one of the most important tools that I had in that role was the ability to talk to the public about what we were doing. And we're not getting that now. So you know it's been almost two months since there was a press conference from CDC and it can leave it feeling that the CDC isn't doing anything. As I talked to colleagues at CDC, I know they're working with State and Local Health Departments, I know that they're working to learn from what's happening in other countries and what different States are trying. But without them coming to the public and explaining what they're learning, explaining why guidance changes over time -- it -- it doesn't lead to the kind of trust that you need, especially now as we're seeing all kinds of things taking place in different States around the country. COOPER: Yeah, I mean, it does seem that they've been knee-capped in a way or -- or hobbled somewhat and the CDC Director, you know, had to come out and sort of try to walk back something he's -- admits himself that he said about the potential for -- for this reoccurring. You know, Laurie Garrett paints a pretty -- her best-case scenario involved a lot of, you know, miraculous things all lining up in perfect order. BESSER: Yeah, you know, I -- I think that there's still so much we don't know about this virus, I'm not a big one for scenario planning and best case, worst case scenarios. Right now, there's some critical science questions that scientists are working on that we need the answers to.   The big one is if you get this infection once, do you get some immunity? Are you protected from getting it again? That's important because - COOPER: And we don't know the --  BESSER: -- if you don't get - COOPER: -- answer to that still. BESSER: We don't know the answer to that, no. We don't, and it's critical because if you don't get any immunity from natural infection, the likelihood that a vaccine will give you the kind of protection you need really goes away. So, it's something being worked on, but until that's answered, the use of anti-body tests around the country really doesn't give you the kind of assurance that Governor's and others want to have. COOPER: You're the former acting director of the CDC, can you ever have imagined a scenario in which the leader of the country who has put out guidelines about to keep people safe and backed those guidelines is now encouraging people to violate those guidelines and backing protestors who are protesting against the very guidelines that person put out. BESSER: You know, back in --  COOPER: Does that help? BESSER: -- 2009 during the swine flu pandemic, when I went to brief the President and the cabinet, what President Obama said to me at the time was ""We want everything that you do to be based on the best public health science."" And I took that message back to the CDC and the emergency operation centre broke out in cheers, it was just what people wanted to hear and it's what the public needs to hear now that everything we're being told to do is based on the best science. Without that there's no way of knowing what things are being told for  political reasons and what things are being done for good science reasons. As we're seeing different populations around the country being affected in different ways -- black Americans, Latinos, native Americans, just getting devastated by this. We need to understand what the government is doing to address those issues and protecting all front-line workers. COOPER: Dr. Fauci has asked the question ""How much suffering are you willing to accept? How much suffering is acceptable?"" And that is kind of the key question moving forward, is there an answer to that? BESSER: Well, you see, I don't think you can ask that question until you are taking every step possible to protect and preserve and save every life that you can. Every life the - COOPER: And that's not being done. BESSER: -- every death that you can prevent -- yes, well what's not being done, we don't have the testing capacity now to know where this disease is.  We haven't scaled up the thousands and thousands of contact traces that we need, we don't provide safe places for people to isolate or quarantine if they're identified as either having an infection or being in contact. We are saying ""If you have money and you're white, you can do well here. If you're not, good luck to you."" COOPER: That is what it boils down to. I mean - BESSER: It really - COOPER: -- all the inequities that existed before are exponentially higher in a pandemic like this. BESSER: Yes, I don't think you can say ""Well, how much suffering are you willing to bear in order to restart the economy?"" until you've done everything possible to ensure that every single person in America can take measures to protect their own health, the health of their families and the health of their communities, and that's just not the case right now.  So, it's a false question until we're ensuring that every work place has protective equipment. The front line workers who we're considering essential, we didn't consider them essential before this began, most of them weren't even being paid a living wage. So, now they're being --  COOPER: Yes. BESSER: -- forced to bare the brunt of this. We can't accept that as a society, it's not the America that we really believe we should have. COOPER: Yes, a lot of the essential workers, a number of them are actually still vulnerable to deportation because they are undocumented and they're working the fields and they're working in these processing plants, which the administration now says they are essential ironically. Dr. Besser, appreciate it.  New York City Police Department has been especially hard hit by the coronavirus with thousands in it's ranks falling sick, that includes Deputy Commissioner John Miller, what he went through and how the department is fairing as a whole.   (COMMERCIAL BREAK) COOPER: Here in New York more than 5,000 members of the New York City Police Department have tested positive for coronavirus. One of them is John Miller, the Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence and counterterrorism who was hit hard by the virus, went to the hospital, he's recovered, he joins me tonight. So, John, first of all, just how are you feeling? JOHN MILLER, NYPD DEPUTY COMMISSIONER FOR INTELLIGENCE AND COUNTERTERRORISM: I'm feeling great, a little stir-crazy after five weeks either in the hospital or at home, but I got to watch a lot of TV, so I can tell you two things. Congratulations on the baby, Wyatt looks great and that must be wonderful. COOPER: Thanks. MILLER: And two, from watching all that TV, you've been doing a great job and I wanted to pass that on. COOPER: Well, I appreciate that, I appreciate that. You don't strike me as the kind of guy who wants to rush to a hospital. MILLER: So, I am the kind of guy who doesn't even want to rush to a doctor, a band-aid, anything. But it was one of those things where it was like a cold, but then it was kind of like a flu but then it was a little like pneumonia and my wife Everly said ""You know, your temperature's climbing to 103, your oxygen levels are down and I'm calling the doctor"" and the doctor was calling the ambulance.  So, I just ran out to the car and took myself to Lennox Hill where from that night on -- was 10 o'clock at night, that team took great care of me. COOPER: And 38 employees at the NYPD have not survived. MILLER: That's right. We lost 38 people and it was from all walks of the department -- school safety agents, tow truck drivers, traffic enforcement agents, police officers, detectives, PCTs or communications technicians, the people who answer the 911 calls. It was a terrible impact and made worse by the fact that we couldn't honor them the way we as an organization traditionally would.   Memorial services had to be put off, funerals had to be done minimally. It's been very difficult. COOPER: There are few jobs which are as tough as being a police  officer, but, I mean, especially in a time like this where social distancing is not something you have much control over necessarily as a police officer. I mean, people get in your face.  People -- you know, you have to interact with people, and obviously you try to do as much as you can, but that's just got to be incredibly stressful to have that added burden of this virus in the middle of any interactions with, you know, citizens and police.  MILLER: Well, it is. And, you know, this is something we've never done before. It's not like we can look back to the last pandemic and say, ""Well, what lessons for policing did we pick up there?"" The last thing we dealt with was Ebola, which was very serious, but it was very small here, very contained and didn't offer these lessons.  So, you know, the police officers have been told, ""Use extreme discretion, you know, try and talk your way through these things with people,"" because they haven't been through it before either. Start with a warning and some advice. If that doesn't work, you can go to a summons if that is persistent. And if that doesn't work, arrest. And in a city of 8.6 million people with that -- with that kind of activity, I think we have been very judicious. Now, I know there's video tape out there of an arrest that's been controversial. You know, you see these things and that's under investigation, obviously, and we're trying to be as transparent about that as possible. But then there are things that are much vaguer. If you're in Central Park and there's four people on a blanket and they're too close together but they're all in the same family and they live in a same apartment and they're six feet or more away from the other blankets, do you tell them to move apart? Do you tell them to wear their mask? All of this is just new territory and I think the cops are doing the very best they can. And I know that because we have had complaints from the religious sects in the Jewish community where we've had to reduce the number of people at funerals and houses of worship and in other ethnic neighborhoods in the city.  We have had complaints in the newspaper from people from the Upper West Side who didn't like being approached. So usually if you're making everybody unhappy, you're being unfair. But it's something we're learning as we go and people are learning with us.  COOPER: Yes. Well, I certainly appreciate all the efforts made by so many of the folks who keep this city running and police are certainly high on that list. John Miller, it's good to talk to you. Thanks very much, I'm really glad you're doing well.  MILLER: You too, Anderson. COOPER: Up next, honoring the hospital heroes on the eve of National Nurse's Day.   (COMMERCIAL BREAK) COOPER: Most nights we take this time to remember the lives that have been lost during this pandemic and we continue to remember them, but we also want to talk about those who are helping to save lives during this crisis.  Tomorrow's National Nurses Day, so tonight we wanted to specially honor them, nurses working around the clock -- often with limited protective equipment in high risk environments, many nurses are volunteers who left their families behind in order to help here in New York and other hard-hit cities. They chose to come here, came here and chose to do this work.  Jim Mullin is a registered nurse who left the health world to become a lawyer, when the virus hit though, he told us he was watching the news and realized his background as an ER nurse could help. His wife Gina was already battling the virus, she's an ER doctor in Dallas, they've got a beautiful little daughter there.  Despite the risk to himself and his family, Jim made the decision to fly to New York where the number of cases was overwhelming the hospitals. When he arrived, he said it was unlike anything he imagined, he continued on working 12-hour overnight shifts with few days off. He's now safely at home in Texas, still in quarantine, still waiting to see his family.  Taylor Campbell also volunteered to work in New York City, she left her home in Rhode Island in April, she posted an account about one of her patients who was already on a ventilator when Taylor began treating her. For 15-days, Taylor cared for this patient until she was finally strong enough to get off the ventilator. Taylor held her hand as she was extubated and a few moments later, her patient mouthed her first words to Taylor. She said ""I love you"". It was, in Taylor's words, a beautiful moment.  Ben Kayher and Mindy Brock are both nurses who have been married for five years, this photo of them and their layers of protective gear looking into each others eyes went viral became a symbol of love and hope and so many things in the middle of this crisis. They're both volunteering at Tampa's general hospital, they say they found each other in-between surgeries one day and that's when this photo was taken.  There are so many stories of the sacrifices that nurses are making every single day. If you know a nurse, whether or not you've been treated for the virus, remember to say thank you. News continues, I'm going to hand over to Chris for ""Cuomo Prime Time"". Chris. CHRIS CUOMO, CNN HOST: Anderson, thank you so much as always. Have a great night. I am Chris Cuomo. Welcome to ""PRIME TIME"".  "
2,Fox,"I’m just going to list some lawsuits arising from the coronavirus pandemic, straight from The Washington Post. Airlines have been sued over grounded flights. Ticket brokers have been sued over canceled events. Insurers have been sued over coverage limits. Grocers and Internet retailers have been sued over rising prices. Hospitals have been sued over protective gear. Universities have been sued over closures. Amusement parks have been sued over unusable season passes. Ski resorts have been sued over refunds. Strip clubs have sued for federal benefits. DEROY MURDOCK: TRUMP TEAM'S CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE — THEY INSPIRED, MOTIVATED AND TURNED THE TIDE A church has been sued for holding services. Cruise lines have been sued for sailing with the virus. Banks have been sued for helping existing customers first. Gyms have been sued for collecting membership fees. Walmart has been sued for allegedly allowing a sick worker to infect others. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Target has been sued over the efficacy of its hand sanitizer. Hooters has been sued over allegedly stinting on severance. Ride-hailing firms have been sued over sick leave. And multiple employers have been sued for allegedly firing workers who complained about safety measures. So here's a suggestion. When the lockdown lifts, everyone should go back to work – except the lawyers. Seriously. I think this is the first time we are starting a civilization with the burden of lawyers. When the world began, you didn't need a real estate lawyer to buy a cave. The witch doctor didn’t have to get malpractice insurance. There were no recalls on the wheel. And do you think we'd even have fire if a lawyer was near? So to get us out of this hole today, we need lawyers to lighten up. Congress should attach legal immunity to these bailouts, so companies and organizations don’t get ruined again – by some guy yelled ""cough"" in a crowded theater. Then when the economy returns, we can get back to suing the crap out of each other. This seems like a plan we can all get behind. Except maybe the lawyers. Which means it has to be good."
3,Fox,"At Sunday night’s town hall on Fox News Channel President Donald Trump was asked about the media. I bet he liked that question.  Now, I'm not sure, but I think he liked that question! PRESIDENT TRUMP: I think I like that question. I'm not sure, but I think I like that question. I appreciate it and I appreciate the prayers, too, very much. Look, I am greeted with a hostile press, the likes of which no president has ever seen. The closest would be that gentleman right up there. They always said Lincoln. Nobody got treated worse than Lincoln. I believe I am treated worse. And I feel that if I was kind to them, I'd be, I'd be walked off the stage. I mean, they come at you with the most horrible, horrendous, biased questions. And you see it, 94 or 95 percent of the press is hostile. I know, I know -- Lincoln's run didn’t end well. But Trump was referring to assaults by the media, not by disgruntled actors (although they’re easily confused). The danger with asking Trump about the press is that it creates that never-ending media spiral. The media attacks Trump, Trump fights back. The media responds angrily since fighting back is breaking the rules -- So Trump rips them again -- which they cover again, like its D-Day. Meanwhile, we all remember who helped elect Trump. The media. And, some of today’s loudest Trump haters fawned all over him during election season. But I'd rather have a president who is generous with insults but stingy with blood and treasure. Does a selfish media agree?"
